    "Dominican revolutionary (1826\u20131898)\nBenito Monci\u00f3n Duran (March 29, 1826 \u2013 February 11, 1898) was a Dominican revolutionary and a prominent leader in the Dominican Restoration War.\nAt an early age, he moved with his mother to the border community of La Visite, Dajab\u00f3n. Despite his limited education, he was characterized by possessing a natural intelligence. He worked as a day laborer for the merchant Santiago Rodr\u00edguez Masago. Because he lived near the border, he was one of the first Dominicans to face the Haitian invasions. In 1845, he received the rank of Sergeant of Grenadiers for his courage and will in the Battle of Beler and was later promoted to second lieutenant in the battalion in Dajab\u00f3n.\nWhen the annexation was declared (1861), Monci\u00f3n had the rank of lieutenant in the reserves and took part in the Guayub\u00edn insurrection movement (1863) that was secretly organized in Sabaneta by General Santiago Rodr\u00edguez. However, the uprising was defeated, forcing Monci\u00f3n to cross the Dominican-Haitian border. Monci\u00f3n and other scattered soldiers continued to harass the Spanish troops to keep the spirit of rebellion alive. With the start of the war against Spain on August 16, 1863, Benito Monci\u00f3n reappeared in Guayub\u00edn fighting the Spanish troops and together with other revolutionaries began the definitive offensive in Loma de Capotillo that marked the beginning of the Restoration War.\nFor decades, he was the regional head of the Northwest Line and defender of the interests of this region, where he managed to impose authority, nuanced with politicking, and showing his status as a leader. In 1879, Monci\u00f3n was appointed governor of Monte Cristi, where he established a private fiefdom and assumed princely airs. Following the failure of Casimiro de Moya's revolution against the dictator Ulises Heureaux, Benito Monci\u00f3n was arrested and expelled from the country. He went into exile in the Bahamas and did not return to the country until 1886 after being granted amnesty. Seriously ill, Benito Monci\u00f3n died in Guayub\u00edn on February 11, 1898, at the age of 71.\nEarly life\nHe was born on March 29, 1826, in La Vega, but he grew up in Dajab\u00f3n because his mother moved to live there when Benito was little. A social product of poorest strata of the peasantry, Monci\u00f3n resided in Sabaneta. He was a farm laborer service of the rich hatero and merchant Santiago Rodr\u00edguez Masag\u00f3 and achieved the fame and prestige that accompanied his name, whom due to his outstanding conditions, among them, his Spartan courage, his natural intelligence and his irreducible will to fight, all this demonstrated first in such important events like the Battle of Sabana Larga against the invading Haitian forces on January 24, 1856, and then, during the war against Spain.\nDominican Restoration War\nMain article: Dominican Restoration War\nWhen Spain invaded the country in 1861, he was an Army Lieutenant Colonel, for services rendered during the struggle for independence from Haiti. He was enrolled in the Reserves at the service of the annexation authorities, but he was one of the most industrious fighters to expel the Spanish occupiers. Monci\u00f3n was among the organizers and protagonists of the February 21 uprising in Guayub\u00edn. When it became impossible to keep that town under control, Lucas de Pe\u00f1a ordered it to be abandoned, Monci\u00f3n retreated and tried to become strong at the Mang\u00e1 post, where he fought until the superiority of the physical force of the Spaniards prevailed.\nChief Lucas de Pe\u00f1a and other patriotic officers accepted the peace proposal made by the Spanish through a commission of Dominicans, but Monci\u00f3n flatly rejected it and remained rebellious in the Line fields. He was sentenced to death in default. Together with Santiago Rodr\u00edguez and Pedro Antonio Pimentel, he led the preparations for the restart of the armed struggle. He settled in Haiti from where he sometimes raided the enemy, in coordination with the guerrillas of the Colonel Jos\u00e9 Cabrera. He was present in Capotillo on the August 16, 1863 and from there the combat continued with his comrades in arms. After the clashes in La Patilla and Macab\u00f3n, he participated in the persecution of Brigadier Buceta and on August 17, he was about to die in the town of Cayucal, when he overtook his companions and, with a machete in hand, pounced on Buceta, whom he pursued closely. At that moment Monci\u00f3n's horse rolled on the ground and while trying to get up he was wounded by a sword blow to the head and another to the left arm by a Spanish dragon. The bold and heroic intervention of Pimentel and several other officers prevented them from finishing off the patriot, who was taken to the house of a Guayacanes resident named Francisco Cruz.\nOn August 30, Monci\u00f3n learned that General Gaspar Polanco had moved into the field of restaurateurs and was already in Quinigua and was preparing to attack Santiago. Without recovering, far from it, as if he asked permission to the pain of the injuries to reintegrate into f",

He is an associate professor in the Departments of Robotics and Mechanical Engineering and Director of the Neurobionics Lab at the University of Michigan (UMich).\nRouse's research interests encompass precision machine design, exoskeletons/robotic prostheses development, brushless motors, human locomotion dynamics, perception, psychophysics, neural control of movement, biomechanics, and human performance augmentation.  His work has been featured on TED, The Discovery Channel, CNN, National Public Radio, Wired Magazine UK, and Business Insider. His research has been published in academic journals, including Science Robotics, Nature Biomedical Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Mechatronics, and Nature. With the addition of several patents for wearable robotic system design and control, he is the recipient of awards including the NSF CAREER Award, Departmental Faculty Award, and the Henry Russel Award at University of Michigan.\nEducation\nRouse completed his undergraduate education at Ohio State University, earning a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 2007. Following his undergraduate studies, he then pursued graduate studies at Northwestern University, obtaining a Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering in 2009, followed by a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from 2009 to 2012. After obtaining his doctorate, he pursued a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 2012 to 2014 at the MIT Media Lab working with Hugh Herr.\nCareer\nFollowing his postdoctoral fellowship, Rouse served as an assistant professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Shirley Ryan AbilityLab from 2014 to 2017. Beginning in 2017, he transitioned to an assistant professor at UMich in the Department of Mechanical engineering. In 2022, he was promoted to associate professor in the Departments of Robotics and Mechanical Engineering. In 2021, he went on temporary leave from UMich while he co-founded the exoskeleton team at X, the moonshot factory, and served as a visiting faculty member in the Rapid Evaluation team. His research group, the Neurobionics Lab, studies how and why people should use wearable robotic systems, and designs wearable technologies.\nResearch\nRouse and his research laboratory at UMich (the Neurobionics Lab) have studied how and why people use exoskeletons and robotic prostheses and they leverage that information to develop hardware designs. A common thread within his research program is the topic of system dynamics, coupled with an emphasis on meaningful impact and 'hands-on' engineering. His group conducts scientific studies on human biomechanics and gait, while translating these insights to the development of robotic hardware, including exoskeletons and prostheses.\nRouse has showcased how the idea about leg joint stiffness is varied alongside the pose of the body during gait. He and his group have studied user-preferred settings of exoskeletons and prostheses, and investigated how these preferences vary between users and clinicians. He developed variable-stiffness prostheses and orthoses that can change their stiffness between steps, in addition to contributions in compliant mechanisms. His group also developed a new type of rotational (torsion) spring, which the most energy dense and compact design found in the robotics literature. He investigated exoskeleton control and users' ability to perceive changes in their own metabolic rate. He has developed approaches to understanding the effectiveness of lower-limb exoskeletons and their assistance using concepts from behavioral economics, which was awarded the 2023 Editor's Choice Award by Communications Engineering.\nRouse also founded and leads the Open-Source Leg project, an open-access hardware and software platform to foster lower-limb prosthetics research. The Open-Source Leg (OSL) is a modular, knee-ankle robotic leg that can be used together or separately. The project provides open-access plans and software files to build a high-performance robotic leg, which are then used to study the challenges in the control of these technologies. The design of the first-generation Open-Source Leg was published in an open-access academic journal. The project was awarded 'Most Innovative' by Fast Company in 2020 and has been featured in media publications.\nAwards and honors\n2019 \u2013 CAREER Award, National Science Foundation\n2023 \u2013 Departmental Faculty Award, University of Michigan\n2024 \u2013 Henry Russel Award, University of Michigan\nSelected articles\nRouse, E.

    "1987 opera by Wolfgang Rihm\nOedipus is an opera in two parts composed by Wolfgang Rihm to a German-language libretto that he based on the Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex by Sophocles and related texts by Friedrich Nietzsche and Heiner M\u00fcller. The work is characterised as Musiktheater (Music drama). Written in 1986 and 1987, it was premiered on 4 October 1987 at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, directed by G\u00f6tz Friedrich; it was broadcast live and recorded on DVD.\nHistory\nOedipus was commissioned by Deutsche Oper Berlin. Wolfgang Rihm wrote the libretto and music in 1986 and 1987. He based the libretto on the Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex by Sophocles in the translation by Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, and also on both Friedrich Nietzsche's fragment Oedipus. Reden des letzten Philosophen mit sich selbst. Ein Fragment aus der Geschichte der Nachwelt and Heiner M\u00fcller's \u00d6dipuskommentar.\nThe opera was premiered at Deutsche Oper on 4 October 1987, conducted by Christof Prick and directed by G\u00f6tz Friedrich in a stage design by Andreas Reinhardt\u00a0. The soloists were Andreas Schmidt (Oedipus), William Pell (Kreon), William Dooley (Tiresias), Lenus Carlson (Messanger), William Murray (Shepherd) and Emily Golden (Jokasta).:\u200a15156\u200a The performance was broadcast live on television, and published on DVD. The opera was published by Universal Edition.\nA concert version was played at the 1989 Wiener Festwochen at the Wiener Konzerthaus, conducted by Michael Gielen with Richard Salter as Oedipus and Dunja Vejzovi\u0107 as Jokasta.\nThe opera was performed in 1991 at the Santa Fe Opera in an English version by Carol Borah Palca. It was conducted by George Manahan and directed by Francesca Zambello,  with Rod Gilfry as Oedipus, David Rampy as Kreon, Dooley as Tiresias, Peter Van Derick as Messanger, Patryk Wroblewski as Shephers and Golden as Jokasta.\nA 2003 production was staged at the Theater Krefeld und M\u00f6nchengladbach, with Kenneth Duryea conducting the Niederrheinischen Sinfoniker and Gregor Horres\u00a0 directing in scenic design by Kirsten Dephoff. Johannes M. K\u00f6sters appeared in the title role, and Carola Guber as Jokasta.\nRoles\nLibretto\nRihm fragmented the plot of the Oedipus myth and created new relations. He structured the work in 21 scenes. Six scenes deal with the drama, based on Sophocles. Three scenes reflect the background, played at the back of the stage: Oedipus and the Sphinx, a child limping though a rocky desert, and the scuffle at the crossroads. Four scenes are inner monologues of Oedipus based on Nietzsche. Five scenes are based on M\u00fcller and reflect the action from a more neutral viewpoint.\nMusic\nThe music is scored for an orchestra of two flutes (one doubling piccolo), two oboes, two cor anglais, four clarinets (two doubling bass clarinets), two bassoons, two contrabassoons, four horns, four trumpets (two doubling piccolo trumpets), four trombones, six percussionists, two harps (amplified), piano, and two solo violins. Oedipus and Jokasta play on stage a large hanging metal plate and a large wooden barrel drum.\nThe music is dominated by brass and percussion, illustrating outcry and protest.  The only strings are two solo violins that play after Oedipus blinds himself, accompanying him to the \"farthest distance\". The music plays mostly in extremes of range, both high and low, and in dynamic contrasts. It contains phases of silence and noise, tone clusters and violent percussion outbursts. The chorus appears on stage as a 16-part men's chorus of the counselors, while a mixed chorus, both singing and speaking, is added from tape. Rihm described the aggressive sound language: \"Sound is a weapon here \u2013 or a scalpel?\" (\"Der Klang ist hier Waffe \u2013 oder Skalpell?\")\nRecordings\n4 October 1987 \u2013 Christof Prick (cond.), G\u00f6tz Friedrich (dir.), Andreas Reinhardt\u00a0 (scenic design), chorus and orchestra of the Deutsche Oper Berlin.

The founding partners were John A. Miller AIA and Hugh Martin FAIA, who developed a successful regional practice. After their retirements and deaths the firm was continued by their successors, John A. Lewis AIA, Edwin T. McCowan AIA and William P. Knight AIA until its eventual dissolution in 1998, at which time it was the oldest architectural firm in Alabama.\nHistory\nThe partnership of Miller & Martin was formed in Birmingham, Alabama in 1900 by architects John A. Miller and Hugh Martin, who had met in New York City in the 1890s while working for architect R. H. Robertson. The partners had a general practice and are best remembered for their churches, libraries and college buildings. Between the world wars they were the primary architects for the University of Alabama. Including fraternity and sorority houses in addition to academic buildings such as the Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library (1939), Miller & Martin and Miller, Martin & Lewis completed over seventy works on and around the campus.\nMiller and Martin were both involved in the organization of the architectural profession in Alabama. In 1911 they were among the founders of the Birmingham Society of Architects and in 1916 were charter members of AIA Alabama, the state's American Institute of Architects (AIA) chapter.\nIn 1926 the partnership was expanded to include James A. Lewis. Miller died in 1932, and Martin and Lewis continued the firm under the Miller & Martin name until 1935, when they renamed it Miller, Martin & Lewis. Martin retired from the partnership in 1952. Lewis continued the firm in partnership with Edwin T. McGowan under its same name. Lewis died in 1958 and Martin died in 1959, seven years after his retirement. At the time of his death Martin was regarded as the dean of Alabama architects. He was also recognized nationally, having been elected a Fellow of the AIA in 1942. McCowan continued the firm after their deaths as Miller, Martin & Lewis, Edwin T. McCowan. He dropped the name Miller, Martin & Lewis in 1966 and formed the partnership of McCowan & Knight with William P. Knight.\nThe notable works of the successor firm included continuing work at the University of Alabama, including ten Hoorn Hall (1963), Coleman Coliseum (1968) and the Rose Administration Building (1969). McCowan withdrew from the firm in the 1970s and Knight incorporated the firm as Knight Associates Inc. in 1975. When Knight died in 1997, Knight Associates was acknowledged as the oldest architectural firm in Alabama. It was dissolved in 1998.\nPartner biographies\nJohn A. Miller\nJohn Alexander Miller AIA (September 12, 1862 \u2013 April 19, 1932) was born in Glasgow, Scotland. He was educated and trained there and in London. He worked in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein in South Africa before immigrating to the United States, where he settled in New York City, where he worked for Robertson and others, including Henry Atterbury Smith. In 1900 he moved to Birmingham to join Martin.\nMiller was married to Lucia Edwina Wood and had two children, both daughters.

    "Hjalmar Bergstr\u00f6m, sometimes given as Hjalmar Bergstr\u00f8m, (1 August 1868 \u2013 28 March 1914) was a Danish writer and educator. His output included short stories, novels, and plays.\nLife and career\nBorn in Copenhagen, Bergstr\u00f6m began his professional life as a teacher at the Niels Brock Copenhagen Business College after completing his university studies in 1893.

This was followed by a second volume of short stories Brogede Billeder (English: Various Sketches) in 1897. Other works soon followed, including the novels Brandte Skibe (1898, English: Burnt Ships) and Der Kong David blev gammel (1900, King David Has Grown Old).\nAfter this Bergstr\u00f6m devoted himself to working as a playwright with his first successful play being Idas Bryllup in 1901.

    "Social media trendTalahon refers to a German trend on TikTok and other social media platforms in 2024. The trend is characterised by videos of young men, often with a Muslim migrant background, especially from Arab countries such as Syria, adopting aggressive postures and showcasing luxurious, albeit often fake, accessories. The phenomenon is deeply rooted in a specific portrayal of patriarchy, masculinity, misogyny and materialism, and it has sparked widespread discussion and controversy. Talahon was nominated as the Youth Word of the Year in Germany.\nMeaning\nThe term \"Talahon\" does not have a fixed definition, but it is believed to derive from the Arabic phrase \"taeal huna,\" (Arabic: \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644 \u0647\u0646\u0627) meaning \"come here,\" or from the song \"Ta3al Lahon\" by Syrian-German rapper Hassan, released in 2022. The song's lyrics, which discuss life on the streets, violence, and crime, are reflective of the themes prevalent in the \"Talahon\" trend. Young men identified as \"Talahon\" often display a distinctive style that includes luxury brand tracksuits, Gucci caps, and gold chains.\nCultural context\nThe \"Talahon\" trend has become a symbol of a particular youth subculture that is both celebrated and criticised. Videos often feature participants shadowboxing or performing martial arts kicks while wearing ostentatious clothing and accessories. This portrayal is meant to convey male dominance, fearlessness, and strength, resonating with some youths who see it as a form of self-expression and empowerment.\nCriticism\nCritics argue that the trend perpetuates stereotypes about young men from migrant backgrounds, portraying them as violent, misogynistic, and obsessed with material wealth. This has led to a polarised reception, with some using the term \"Talahon\" ironically to mock these stereotypes, while others embrace it as an authentic representation of their identity.\nThe \"Talahon\" trend has faced significant backlash for its perceived glorification of violence and its patriarchal and misogynistic undertones.\nIntegration experts have criticised the trend, arguing that it promotes a regressive worldview that is harmful to societal cohesion. Additionally, there are concerns about the trend being co-opted by right-wing groups to further marginalise and stigmatise young men with migrant backgrounds.\nReferences\n^ a b WDR (2024-07-26). \"TikTok ist voll mit dem Begriff \"Talahon\".

    "Fictional character from Our Girl\nFictional character\nCaptain James is a fictional character from the BBC military drama Our Girl, played by Ben Aldridge. Captain James first appeared in the first episode of the first series, originally broadcast on 21 September 2014. He is introduced as the laid-back but professional commanding officer of 2-Section. His storylines in the series have included the blossoming of his romance with Molly Dawes (Lacey Turner), his intense dedication to his work, his friendship with Elvis Harte (Luke Pasqualino), his inner struggles surrounding the morality of war, and his second romance with Georgie Lane (Michelle Keegan).\nCaptain James has been described as experienced and authoritarian, but fun and easygoing. Aldridge enjoyed the task of playing someone in charge. His character's toxic love of his work was an ongoing theme during his time on the series, as Aldridge noticed that his character was happy in his co-workers' company and could only function in the army. Aldridge was captivated by his character's continuing mental health struggles, as he found it to be a delicate matter within the armed forces. After the cast for the show's fourth series was announced, and Aldridge's absence was quickly noted, it was confirmed that he had left the role to pursue other projects he had commitments to. Captain James's relationship with Georgie was criticised by viewers, and his departure was seen as abrupt and underwhelming.\nStorylines\nCaptain James is introduced as the commanding officer of 2-Section on a tour in Camp Bastion in Afghanistan. He initially doubts the capabilities of the team's new medic, Molly Dawes (Lacey Turner), but learns to respect her after saving the life of fellow soldier Smurf (Iwan Rheon) in an act of bravery. Despite Captain James telling her not to, Molly befriends a local girl named Bashira (Becky Eggersglusz), who warns her not to let 2-Section go to a mountain checkpoint, proving to be vital information which impresses him. After Molly returns from her rest and recuperation leave, she confesses her love for him, feelings which he reciprocates, despite having an estranged wife, Rebecca (Alice Patten), and a son. Upon finding out about this, Molly is initially furious but forgives him. Captain James is injured in battle and narrowly survives. Once the tour finishes, he goes on a date with Molly in his hometown of Bath, England. He decides to maintain his relationship with her while remaining in the army after divorcing Rebecca.\nAfter marrying Molly, Captain James offers Lance Corporal Georgie Lane (Michelle Keegan), an experienced army medic, a place on a humanitarian mission in Kenya with 2-Section, which she accepts. After Georgie is taken hostage by a faction of the terrorist group Al-Shabaab, he requests help from the special forces. A unit arrives, and Captain James is shocked to see it being led by his old friend Elvis Harte (Luke Pasqualino), who is also Georgie's ex-fianc\u00e9 who abandoned her on their wedding day. After they rescue her, 2-Section is granted two days of rest before returning to Britain. When they get home, Captain James offers Georgie a spot on a mission in Syria in five weeks. Although Georgie is open to it, her fianc\u00e9 Jamie (Royce Pierreson) interferes and tells him not to let her do it to prioritise her mental health. After Georgie tells him she has decided to leave the army, Captain James supports her decision but asks her to reconsider it. He later warns Elvis not to intrude on Georgie's wedding to Jamie.\nAfter an earthquake in Nepal, 2-Section is deployed on a humanitarian mission there, and Captain James arranges for Georgie to mentor new recruit Maisie Richards (Shalom Brune-Franklin). He is annoyed with her behaviour, but after a successful mission manages to see past some of her flaws. When 2-Section is called to Kathmandu barracks, Captain James and Elvis are reacquainted and it transpires that 2-Section will assist special forces on a mission in Afghanistan, to Captain James's reluctance. He cheers up when he meets Captain Azizi again, who asks him to abort the mission out of fear of how the British Army's presence impacts Afghanistan's terrorism. After the mission fails and many are injured, Captain James figures out Captain Azizi was in on it and furiously confronts him before Azizi is accidentally shot by an insurgent. When they eventually retreat to Kabul, Captain James is proud of the team but faces inner struggles regarding the British Army's involvement in Afghanistan. He later witnesses Elvis's death and is crushed by it.\nAfter a tour in Nigeria, 2-Section prepares for a training exercise in Belize. Captain James has received a bad report on his record for being tricked by Captain Azizi, so hopes to prove himself. During the exercise, Captain James is caught in a booby trap which seriously injures his leg, leaving him unable to walk. With lethal drug bandits populating the jungle, Captain James, Georgie, and a local t",

    "Scottish \u202ageomorphologist\nColin Kerr Ballantyne FRSE FRSA FRSGS (born 7 June 1951 in Glasgow, Scotland) is a Scottish geomorphologist, geologist, and physical geographer.\nEducation and career\nColin K. Ballantyne graduated in 1973 with an M.A. from the University of Glasgow, where he was influenced by Robert John Price (1936\u20132012) to study geomorphology and Quaternary geology. Ballantyne graduated in 1975 with an M.Sc. from Ontario's McMaster University, where he was part of a team led by S. Brian McCann (1935\u20132004) studying high arctic hydrology and fluvial processes. In 1975 Ballantyne returned to Scotland and became a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh. There he graduated in 1980 with a PhD thesis on the periglacial geomorphology of mountains in northwestern Scotland. His PhD thesis was supervised by Brian Sissons (1926\u20132018).\nAt the University of St Andrews, Ballantyne was a lecturer in geography from 1980 to 1989, a senior lecturer in geography and geology from 1989 to 1994, and  a professor of physical geography from 1994 to 31 January 2015, when he retired as professor emeritus. In the School of Geography and Geosciences of the University of St Andrews, he was the head from 1998 to 2000 and the director of research from 2007 and 2012. Since 2000 he is a guest professor at University Centre Svalbard in Svalbard, Norway. He was twice an Erskine Fellow at New Zealand's University of Canterbury, where he has taught summer school courses over many years. As a professor at the University of St Andrews, Ballantyne conducted annual honours field courses in Norway \u2014 on one such occasion his students included the future Duke of Cambridge.\nResearch\nColin K. Ballantyne is the author or co-author of more than 150 articles in refereed journals.\nMuch of Ballantyne's reputation is based upon his reconstruction of the extent and deglaciation chronology of the last British-Irish ice sheet and his 2002 model of paraglacial landscape modification. He and his co-workers have done research on geomorphological mapping, glaciation, and periglaciation, as well as many related topics such as frost weathering, nivation, solifluction, hydrology, debris flow, rockfall, slope stability, and wind erosion. He was the co-author, with Charles Harris, of The Periglaciation of Great Britain (Cambridge University Press, 1994), which for the next two decades was an essential reference for periglacial research in the British Isles. In the Hebrides, Ballantyne single-handedly did field mapping and theoretical reconstruction of former glacier limits on all the major islands between Orkney and Arran. In 2012 he was the co-author, with Derek Fabel and Sheng Xu, of an important article that presented convincing evidence that periglacial trimlines, instead of representing the maximum altitude of the last ice sheet, actually represent thermal boundaries which separated wet-based ice at pressure melting point from cold-based ice on summit plateaus. The evidence consisted of establishing the dates of high-level erratic boulders above trimlines on five mountains in northwestern Scotland and empirically demonstrating that the last ice sheet overtopped the five mountains.\nAvocations\nIn addition to his interest in music, history, and travel, Ballantyne is a skilled mountain climber. He climbed all the Scottish Munros at least twice (and many of them three or more times). He ascended Mount Kilimanjaro (on the summit of which he proposed to his future wife Rebecca). He climbed many mountains in New Zealand and Europe, including many of Norway's peaks over 2000 meters. Accompanied by Chris Bonington, he ascended Mount Elbrus.\nFamily\nColin K. Ballantyne married Rebecca Josephine Trengove in August 1996. They have a son and a daughter.\nAwards and honours\nBallantyne received in 1986 the Warwick Award and in 1999 the Wiley Award of the British Society for Geomorphology (formerly the British Geomorphological Research Group). The Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS) awarded him in 1990 the RSGS's President's Medal, in 1991 the Newbigin Prize, and in 2015 the Coppock Research Medal. In 1996 he received the Saltire Society's Scottish Science Award and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In 2000 he was awarded a D.Sc. from  the University of St Andrews. In 2010 the Edinburgh Geological Society awarded him the Clough Medal. In 2015 the Geological Society of London awarded him the Lyell Medal.\nSelected publications\nArticles\nBallantyne, C.

    "American basketball coach\nJohn Moran is an American coach who was notable for serving as head coach of Shell Turbo Chargers in the PBA.\nCoaching career\nA former assistant of Bob Knight at Indiana, Moran was hired as head coach of Shell Turbo Chargers in the PBA, replacing Perry Ronquillo. But due to Basketball Coaches Association of the Philippines' skepticism of hiring non-Filipino coaches for the league, Moran's appointment was expected to be under protest, but the association let Moran coach NBA.\nIn his PBA coaching career, Moran was noted for benching its rookie Rich Alvarez and only winning once out of first five games. He was later fired and replaced by Leo Austria. Even tough, some league key people like Tim Cone and Asi Taulava applauded Moran's offensive system.\nAfter Shell stint, he was rumored to be a consultant for some PBA teams, but it did not materialized.\nMoran quoted the following about his offensive system when he was coaching Shell:I think it\u2019s a system that can make the Philippine team easily beat Korea and Japan. If you\u2019re selfish, you can\u2019t play in that style. In the NBA (National Basketball Association), players have gotten to be too selfish and that\u2019s why they struggle in international competitions against teams like Argentina and Yugoslavia.\nReferences\n^ Cruz, Agnes (2004-01-09). \"BCAP Set to Wage War Against Shell Over US Coach\".

    "Remote controlled weapon station\nNCSIST\u00a0 2.75in rockets remote weapon station is a Remote weapon station made by NCSIST to launch Mk66 2.75inch rockets. The system is eligible of using multiple types of fuzing techniques to cope with the needs of the user in both military and policing scenarios.\nHistory\nDuring the development stage, the team of engineers at NCSIST highly utilized experiences gained during previous developments of the Kestrel ATM and XTR-101/102 systems. The team first displayed a system called \"Coastal Defense Rocket Artillery System\" with 12 7-cell pods at TADTE (Taipei Aerospace and Defense Exhibition) 2015, but didn't receive any orders, or much interest, from the ROC Army. The system than was set aside until the CGA established \"Plan of Procuring CG Vessels (2018 to 2027)\", which gave the team an opportunity to persuade the system for CG usage. Due to the high need of 40mm guns (namely the Bofors 40mm), there's no excess guns for the CGA to use in arsenal. Therefore, the CGA turned to a modified version of the artillery system prototype with 6 turrets instead of the original 12 for use on Anping-class OPVs and Chiayi-class OPVs.\nDesign and Development\nThe shipborne version debuted at the commission ceremony of the ROC Coast Guard 600 ton OPV, where it was given the name \"\u93ae\u6d77\u706b\u7bad\u5f48\u7cfb\u7d71\" (in traditional Chinese form).Due to the low need of massive fire projection, the coast Guard version is solely armed with 6 launch pods, each featuring 7 rockets. The warheads are then derived into \"High Explosive\", \"Anti-Armor\", and \"Area Destruction\", along a later version of \"Lighting\" for SAR missions. The \"Lighting\" version can last for more than five minutes to support continuous operations at night.\nDuring the first batch of the RWS, the system experienced issues on low operable elevation due to the overall height of the system. Later on, starting from the forth delivery of the Anping-class OPVs, the team developed a new version featuring an integrated cupola and elevated pedestal, which expanded the possible operating scenarios and elevation.\nGallery\n2015 display of its predecessor, the coastal defense rocket artillery system, at TADTE 2015\nback look of the coastal defense rocket artillery system\nthe NCSIST\u00a0 2.75in rockets remote weapon station on Anping-class offshore patrol vessel CG-601\nside look of the system\nNCSIST\u00a0 2.75in rockets remote weapon station launching  Mk66 on CG-602\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g \"\u7058\u5cb8\u9632\u79a6\u706b\u7bad\u5f48\u7cfb\u7d71\u5f71\u7247\". \u570b\u5bb6\u4e2d\u5c71\u79d1\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u9662. 2015-08-12.

    "Station in South Australia, 1878 to 1968\nMorgan railway station was the terminus of the Morgan railway line. It served the town of Morgan, South Australia.\nHistory\nMorgan railway station opened when the North-West Bend railway reached it on 23 September 1878. It was built to provide a more efficient freight and passenger connection between the Murray paddle steamers and both the city of Adelaide and Port Adelaide for ocean transport.  The station was named after Sir William Morgan, who was the Chief Secretary of the state at that time.  The station building consisted of a ticket office, refreshment rooms, railway platform and goods cranes.  Locomotive  'Pioneer' had made the first trial run to Morgan as early as 17 April 1878. The venture had succeeded. The river/rail transport system was cheap, quick and reliable, and had opened up new and exciting opportunities for both the river traffic and people on the land. The goods could now begin flowing in both directions-the produce to the outside markets, and heavy capital items could be brought in to open up the country. In 1883 the value of goods passing wharf to rail was 238,453 pounds.  Morgan eventually became one of the busiest shipping ports on the Murray and the second biggest in South Australia.  About six trains a day carried freight from the Murray to the sea at Port Adelaide. \nDecline and closure\nRail transport at the port declined during the early 20th century as road transport approved. Regular passenger services ceased in December 1968. The last train Duchess of Gloucester pulled out of Morgan in November 1969.  The railway line was eventually dismantled with the station being officially closed. \nPresent day\nThe station building was registered as a South Australian Heritage on 4 March 1993.  The station was converted into a historic railway museum with ticket office, railway refreshment room, oil shed and railway platform cranes, railway track and miscellaneous carriages being put on the display. \nReferences\n^ North West Bend railway 23 September 1878 \n^ Names of South Australian railway stations \n^ Morgan Railway Museum \n^ Morgan's railways \n^ History of the Morgan Township Early Pastoral Activity near Morgan \n^ Morgan's railways \n^ SA Heritage Places Database Search \n^ Morgan Railway Museum \n",
    "\nThe sertanejos are a people linked to livestock farming and agriculture in the Sert\u00e3o region in the Northeast of Brazil, specifically in the Caatinga, a biome that covers much of the territories of the Brazilian states of Bahia, Cear\u00e1, Piau\u00ed, Pernambuco, Para\u00edba, Rio Grande do Norte, Sergipe and Alagoas, and the cerrado which covers parts of the states of Maranh\u00e3o, Bahia and Piau\u00ed, in addition to the Agreste region, where a transition occurs between the Atlantic Forest and Caatinga.The emergence of the sertanejos dates back to the 16th century in Bahia with the vaqueiros, driven by the advancement of livestock farming towards the interior.\nTipos de Feira de Santana, Bahia - typos do norte 1880 by Thereza Christina Maria\nThe sertanejo people were basically formed by the miscegenation between Portuguese and indigenous people, especially speakers of macro-J\u00ea languages. The African slave was little present in the Sert\u00e3o, as livestock farming normally used the free labor of the vaqueiros.\nMany consider the sertanejo to be the stereotype of the man from the Brazilian Northeast, comparable to the caipiras or the gauchos.\nOrigin and culture\nIllustrated map; In red it shows the location where the sertanejos and their culture emerged in Bahia, starting from the 16th century.\n Sertanejos in the caatinga, state of Bahia, engraving from the 1810s.\nCattle were introduced on the eastern coast of northeastern Brazil just at the beginning of the sugar cycle and served as food and animal traction for the sugarcane plantations. Over the decades, the herds multiplied and caused inconveniences to the sugarcane fields. With that, groups of Portuguese and mamelucos without economic resources or political power were pushed, along with the cattle from the sugarcane fields, to the Sert\u00e3o of Bahia in the 16th century.  These pioneers and their descendants were in constant conflict with the indigenous people, despite the strong miscegenation with them, and advanced throughout the Sert\u00e3o of the northeast region of Brazil, populating it, following the course of the rivers.\nOriginally, there were two large latifundia that dominated the Sert\u00e3o: Casa da Torre (\"House of the Tower\" in Spanish), owned by the Garcia d'\u00c1vila family, and Casa da Ponte (\"House of the Bridge\" in Spanish), owned by the Guedes de Brito family. These latifundia were divided into smaller estates, which were rented to the vaqueiros.\nLife for the inhabitants of the Sert\u00e3o was difficult. Only milk and meat were abundant, and curdled milk and cheese were used only for their own consumption. Cassava flour was added to the meat, thus originating pa\u00e7oca, a typical dish of the Sert\u00e3o. Various artifacts of sertanejo life, such as huts, canteens, backpacks, and clothing, were made from cattle hides. Droughts have always been present in the Sert\u00e3o. The Brazilian anthropologist Darcy Ribeiro compared the sertanejo cowboys and farmers to the peasants in serfdom of feudal Europe, as both lived their entire lives, from birth, in the region of origin of their parents and grandparents, were tied to land they did not own, and had to pay high taxes to the landowners.\nContacts between the Sert\u00e3o and the coast were sporadic and occurred only at certain times of the year, through fairs where cattle ranchers and traders gathered, many of which gave rise to population centers, embryos of current cities such as Feira de Santana (Bahia), Campina Grande (Para\u00edba), Pastos Bons (Maranh\u00e3o), Serra Talhada (Pernambuco), and Oeiras (Piau\u00ed).\nLocation\n Map of the subregions of the Northeast Region, Brazil, with the northeastern Sert\u00e3o being number 2 on the map.\nSee also\nSert\u00e2nia\nSert\u00e3o\nReferences\n^ Aziz Nacib (1999). \"Sert\u00f5es e sertanejos: uma geografia humana sofrida\" .

    "Federal electoral district of Mexico\nFederal electoral districts of Oaxaca since 2022\nOaxaca under the 2017\u20132022 districting plan\nThe tenth federal electoral district of Oaxaca (Distrito electoral federal 10 de Oaxaca) is one of the 300 electoral districts into which Mexico is divided for elections to the federal Chamber of Deputies and one of 10 such districts in the state of Oaxaca.\nIt elects one deputy to the lower house of Congress for each three-year legislative period by means of the first-past-the-post system. Votes cast in the district also count towards the calculation of proportional representation (\"plurinominal\") deputies elected from the third region.\nOaxaca's tenth district was created as part of the 1977 electoral reforms. Under the 1975 districting plan, Oaxaca had only nine congressional districts; under the 1977 reforms, the number increased to ten. The newly created tenth district elected its first deputy, to the 51st Congress, in the 1979 legislative election.\nDistrict territory\nUnder the 2022 districting plan, which is to be used for the 2024, 2027 and 2030 federal elections, the tenth district covers 77 municipalities.\nThe district's head town (cabecera distrital), where results from individual polling stations are gathered together and collated, is the city of Miahuatl\u00e1n de Porfirio D\u00edaz in the Sierra Sur region.\nWith Indigenous and Afrodescendent inhabitants accounting for over 63% of its population, it is classified by the National Electoral Institute (INE) as an indigenous district.\nPrevious districting schemes\n2017\u20132022\nOaxaca's 11th district was dissolved in the 2017 redistricting process. Under the 2017 to 2022 scheme, the ninth district had its head town at the city of Miahuatl\u00e1n and it covered 65 municipalities.\n2005\u20132017\nBetween 2005 and 2017, the tenth district comprised 56 municipalities and its head town was Miahuatl\u00e1n.\n1996\u20132005\nBetween 1996 and 2017, Oaxaca's seat allocation was increased to 11. Under the 1996 districting plan, the head town was moved to Miahuatl\u00e1n.\n1978\u20131996\nThe districting scheme in force from 1978 to 1996 was the result of the 1977 electoral reforms, which increased the number of single-member seats in the Chamber of Deputies from 196 to 300. Under that plan, Oaxaca's seat allocation rose from nine to ten.\nThe new tenth district had its head town at Santo Domingo de Tehuantepec in the Istmo de Tehuantepec region.\nDeputies returned to Congress\nNotes\n^ Oaxaca accounts for 3.3% of the country's population and 4.8% of its surface area, but it contains almost a quarter of its municipalities: 570 out of 2,446.\nReferences\n^ \"How Mexico Elects Its Leaders \u2014 The Rules\".

    "Kingdom in Western India (475\u2013776)\nThe Kingdom of Valabhi was an early medieval kingdom in Western India from 475 to 776. It was founded by Bhatarka, a military governor of the Magadhan Empire, and ruled by the Maitraka dynasty.\nFollowing the decline of the Magadhan Empire,  Bha\u1e6d\u0101rka, the military governor of the Saurashtra region, founded the Maitraka dynasty in 475. He was followed by his son Dharasena I, who also used the title of general (senapati). His son, Dro\u1e47asi\u1e41ha proclaimed himself Maharaja. Guhasena (r. 556\u2013570) stop recognising the suzerainty of the emperor of Magadha and his son, Dharasena II started using the sovereign title of Maharajadhiraja.\nThe kingdom came under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Kannauj during the reign of Harsha following which the kingdom became independent again after his death in 647. The kingdom collapsed in 776 after prolonged Arab invasions.\nHistory\nBha\u1e6d\u0101rka\nCoinage of Bha\u1e6d\u0101rka (Maitrakas of Valabhi). Obverse: Head of the kings facing right. Reverse: Trishula trident (symbol of Shiva) with legend in the Brahmi script: R\u00e1j\u00f1o Mah\u00e1kshatrapasa Bhat\u00e1rakasa Mahesara\u2013\u015ar\u00ed Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u00e1rakasa \"Of the illustrious, the Shaivaite, Bhattaraka, the great king; the great Kshtrapa; the Lord and devotee of Maheshwara.\"\nThe Senapati (general) Bha\u1e6d\u0101rka, was a military governor of Saurashtra peninsula under the Magadhan Empire, who had established himself as the independent ruler of Gujarat approximately in the last quarter of 5th century when the Gupta empire weakened. He continued to use the title of Senapati (general). Apart from his military accomplishments, not much is known from the copper-plates. He was \u015aaiva according to the title Parama-Maheshwara used for him in grants by his descendants. It seems that he transferred the capital from Girinagar (Girnar) to Vallabhi. The legends of all Valabhi coins are marked with Sri-Bha\u1e6d\u0101rka. Almost all the Maitraka inscriptions start with his name. He is known only from the copperplate inscriptions of descendants.\nDharasena I\nCoinage of Dharasena (Maitraka, 570\u2013606 CE, Gujarat), on the model of the Western Satraps. National Museum, New Delhi.\nBha\u1e6d\u0101rka was succeeded by his eldest son Dharasena I who also used only the title of Senapati (general). He reigned approximately from 174 to 180 Valabhi Era (VE) (c. 493\u2013499 CE). It seems that he further consolidated power in weakening Magadhan Empire. the Maitrkas had a marriage alliance with Harisena, the King of Avanti who had himself captured many regions formerly under Magadha. Chandralekha, who is described in Dharasanasara of Devasena as the daughter of the king of Ujjayani and the queen of Dhruvasena I.\nDro\u1e47asi\u1e41ha\nDro\u1e47asi\u1e41ha (c. 499 - c. 519 CE), a younger brother of Dharasena I, declared himself as Maharaja known from his copperplate dated 183 VE (502 CE). It is known that his coronation was attended by some higher authority, probably Ujjain as they had a marriage alliance.\nEran pillar inscription of BhanuguptaEran pillarEran stone pillar inscription.Rubbing of the inscription.The Eran stone pillar inscription of Bhanugupta mentions a \"very big and famous battle\" between the Guptas and the Maitrakas.\nAccording to the Eran inscription of Gupta Empire ruler Bhanugupta (new revised translation published in 1981), Bhanugupta and his chieftain or noble Goparaja participated in a battle against the \"Maittras\" in 510 CE, thought to be the Maitrakas (the reading being without full certainty, but \"as good as certain\" according to the authors). This would directly allude to the conflict between Valabhi and the Magadhan Empire during the reign of Dro\u1e47asi\u1e41ha. The inscription reads:\n(Verses 3-4) (There is) the glorious Bhanugupta, a distinguished hero on earth, a mighty ruler, brave being equal to Partha. And along with him Goparaja, following (him) without fear, having overtaken the Maittras and having fought a very big and famous battle, went to heaven, becoming equal to Indra, the best of the gods; and (his) devoted, attached, beloved, and beauteous wife, clinging (to him), entered into the mass of fire (funeral pyre).\n\u2014\u200aEran inscription of Bhanugupta, 510 CE.\nIt is also around this time, or soon after, that the Alchon Huns king Toramana invaded Malwa, leading to his mention as \"ruler of the earth\" in the Eran boar inscription of Toramana.\nDhruvasena I\nDhruvasena I was the third son of Bha\u1e6d\u0101rka and the younger brother of Dro\u1e47asi\u1e41ha. He reigned c. 519 - c. 549 CE. During his rule, Yashodharman of the Kingdom of Malwa had defeated Harisena of the Ujjain, as well as the Huna king Mihirakula (in 528 CE). Dhruvasena probably had to acknowledge to overlord-ship of Yashodharman. It is known that they had regained their glory as Yashodharman's rule was short lived and was supplanted by the Guptas.\nIn these grants, Dhruvasena's father Bha\u1e6d\u00e1rka and his elder brothers are described as 'great M\u00e1he\u015bvaras' that are followers of \u015aiva, while Dhruvasena himself is called 'Paramabh\u00e1gavata', the great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava.

    "British soprano\nTessa Bonner (b. London 28 February 1951, d. London 31 December 2008) was a soprano, specialising in repertoire of the Renaissance, Baroque and Classical eras. She sang with The Tallis Scholars for 25 years, with whom she recorded 37 albums and performed in 1,100 concerts.

At 25 she attended the University of Leeds, where she studied voice under Honor Sheppard, continuing her studies as a prize-winning student of Margaret Lensky and Ellis Keeler at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1979.\nSinging career\nPeter Phillips, director of the Tallis Scholars, described her as \"one of the seminal sopranos of the early music movement.\" Prof. Richard Rastall suggested that Bonner, together with another Tallis Scholars soprano Caroline Trevor \"may well approximate to the sound of a good sixteenth-century boy in his late teens.\"\nEnsembles\nIn 1979 Bonner was offered her first professional singing engagement by Andrew Parrott with the Taverner Choir. She would go on to sing with The Tallis Scholars, the New London Consort, The Sixteen, the Lute Group, the Gabrieli Consort, Collegium Musicum 90, The King's Consort, Academy of Ancient Music, St James' Baroque, Consort of Musicke,  His Majestys Sagbutts & Cornetts, Collegium Vocale Gent and London Mozart Players.\nSoloist\nAs a soloist she recorded many albums, including:\nMusica Secreta\nTogether with Deborah Roberts Bonner, Mary Nichols and John Toll, Bonner co-founded Musica Secreta in 1991.

She returned to work in May of the same year and sang her final concert with the Tallis Scholars on 27 November 2008, dying on New Year's Eve. Her long-term partner Donald Greig dedicated his 2012 book Time Will Tell to Bonner.

    "2024 single by Lil Yachty and Ian\n\"Hate Me\" is a song by American rappers Lil Yachty and Ian, released on July 26, 2024 with an accompanying music video directed by Cole Bennett. It was produced by Childboy.\nComposition\nThe lyrics find the artists bragging to and criticizing their enemies, while the beat has been described by critics as \"humming, fizzing\" and \"cyber-equestrian bounce\". Ian performs in a calm flow that has been compared to that of rapper Swapa. At one point Lil Yachty boasts he is \"richer than your favorite rapper\", followed with the line \"If I'm not, then, God, kill my momma\".\nCritical reception\nMano Sundaresan of Pitchfork praised the song for Ian's \"gleefully fried punchlines that made his breakout song 'Figure It Out' instantly memorable\" and commented \"Yachty is comparatively a non-factor, a flashy name to attract Kai Cenat devotees and Despicable Me 4 fans to the Cole Bennett\u2013directed video\". Aaron Williams of Uproxx also reacted favorably toward Ian's performance, writing the song \"gives the young rapper plenty of space to show off his lyrical talents.\"\nCharts\nReferences\n^ Horvath, Zachary (July 26, 2024). \"Lil Yachty & Ian Drop Aptly Titled Track For The Critics, \"Hate Me\"\".

    "\nEvents in 1866 in animation.\nEvents\nJuly 27: The inventor William Ensign Lincoln applied for a U.S. patent for his zoetrope, as an assignor to the board game manufacturing company Milton Bradley and Co.. The patent was granted to him in April 1867. Lincoln had invented the definitive version of the zoetrope in 1865, when he was about 18 years old and a sophomore at the Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Lincoln's patented version had the viewing slits on a level above the pictures, which allowed the use of easily replaceable strips of images. It also had an illustrated paper disc on the base, which was not always exploited on the commercially produced versions. On the advice of a local bookstore owner, Lincoln had sent a model to Milton Bradley and Co. in an attempt to market the animation device. \nDecember: The zoetrope is advertised in American newspapers by various shop owners.\nSpecific date unknown:\nThe photographer William Pumphrey organised an exhibition of Yorkshire Fine Art and Industry, in the grounds of the Bootham Park Hospital. Pumphrey himself introduced an exhibit of two revolving stereoscopes, each containing 50 of his stereo views.\nIn 1866, the French instrument maker and inventor Jules Duboscq demonstrated an early version of the overhead projector. The device is used as an improvement over the magic lantern projector. \nBirths\nApril\nApril 23: Willie Riley, English novelist, (Riley had a career in the sale of magic lantern slides and relevant equipment until 1914, when, with the onset of World War I, his family's company failed.

Born in Glasgow, she took a post at a medical partnership, but left after burning out and became a locum general practitioner (GP). She has presented the BBC Scotland series Laid Bare and has appeared on Morning Live and The Weakest Link. She was announced as a contestant on the twenty-second series of Strictly Come Dancing in August 2024.\nLife and career\nPunam Krishan was born 28 May 1983 in Glasgow, and grew up in a small tenement flat with her younger sister and extended family. Her parents had an arranged marriage, and moved from Kapurthala in Punjab to Scotland in the late 1970s, where her father owned a corner shop. She told Susan Swarbrick of The Herald in July 2019 that education was important to her family, with her parents taking the view that she was either going to become a \"doctor, lawyer, accountant, or a failure\", and that she was raised on curry and Irn-Bru.\nKrishan went to Hillhead Primary School, Notre Dame High School, and the University of Glasgow, where she studied medicine. She took a post at a medical partnership, but left in September 2017 after burning out, and took a post as a locum. She stated in April 2018 article for Pulse Today that she had \"learned the hard way to live without patient \u2018satisfaction\u2019\", and went viral the following January after tweeting an exchange between her practice's receptionist and a racist patient.\nIn October 2019, she began presenting Laid Bare for BBC Scotland, in which patients were given a comprehensive medical check-up and then given a dressing down by Krishan. Writing that month, Swarbrick described her interrogations as \"a living post-mortem\". By October 2021, she had begun making appearances on Morning Live and on BBC Radio Scotland, and in June 2022, she published a children's book, How to Be a Doctor and Other Life-Saving Jobs.

Dorling-Kindersley commissioned Krishan to write a further two children's books in April 2024 for publication the following year; these comprised a flap board book about human anatomy, You and Your Body, and a first aid book, A Superhero's First Aid Manual. In August 2024, she was announced as a contestant on the twenty-second series of BBC One's celebrity dancing competition Strictly Come Dancing.

    "\n8th episode of the 2nd season of House of the Dragon\n\"The Queen Who Ever Was\" is the eighth and final episode of the second season of the fantasy drama television series House of the Dragon, a prequel to Game of Thrones. The episode was written by Sara Hess and directed by Geeta Vasant Patel. It first aired on HBO and Max on August 4, 2024. Several days before its release, scenes from the episode were leaked online and quickly shared among fans on TikTok, X, and Reddit.\nIn the United States, \"The Queen Who Ever Was\" garnered a viewership of 8.9 million during its premiere night, with nearly 1.5 million viewers on linear television alone. The episode was met with mixed reviews from critics, receiving a rating of 50% on Rotten Tomatoes, making it the lowest-rated episode of the series to date. The musical score, cinematography, and cast performances (particularly of Emma D'Arcy, Olivia Cooke, Abubakar Salim, Harry Collett, and Fabien Frankel) were highly praised. However, the episode was criticized as a weak season finale, with its cliffhanger failing to provide a satisfying conclusion to the season, though the set-up for the next season was appreciated.\nPlot\nIn Tyrosh\nTyland Lannister negotiates with the Triarchy's High Council for their fleet to help break the Velaryon shipping blockade. They agree but demand control over the Stepstones. Additionally, Admiral Sharako Lohar, a female warrior using male pronouns, challenges Tyland to a mud-wrestling match before agreeing to sail with him. Tyland wins, earning Lohar's respect, and they set sail for Westeros with the Triarchy's fleet.\nIn the Crownlands\nEnraged over Rhaenyra's new dragonriders, Aemond flies Vhagar to the Black-allied port city, Sharp Point, and incinerates it with dragon fire.\nDuring the march toward Harrenhal, Gwayne sees Criston with Alicent's handkerchief and accuses him of breaking his Kingsguard vows. Despondent, Criston expresses regret over past choices, telling Gwayne he believes they are headed towards annihilation by Rhaenyra's dragons.\nIn King's Landing\nLarys Strong tells Aegon about Rhaenyra's new dragonriders and Aemond's decimating Sharp Point. He also warns that Aemond's rage is an even greater threat to Aegon's life. Aegon wants Aemond imprisoned, but Larys argues Aemond and Vhagar are essential assets to fighting the war. Having moved the bulk of Harrenhal's gold to Braavos' Iron Bank, Larys proposes that he and Aegon hide in Essos and return and reclaim the throne after Aemond and Rhaenyra have destroyed each other.\nAemond demands that Helaena ride her dragon, Dreamfyre, into battle. When she refuses, Aemond reacts roughly, but Alicent intervenes, berating Aemond for being reckless and destructive. Later, Aemond tries gently persuading Helaena, but she again declines, revealing she knows he burnt Aegon and Sunfyre at Rook's Rest. She also says she has foreseen his death in the war and Aegon retaking the throne.\nLater, Aegon and Larys secretly depart the city in a covered wagon.\nAt Driftmark\nCorlys advises Rhaenyra to quickly utilize her new-found military advantage of more dragonriders. Corlys tries to bond with Alyn, who rebuffs his paternal attempts. Alyn rebukes Corlys for never showing interest in him and Addam when his legitimate children were alive, leaving the brothers to suffer as bastards. Corlys and Alyn set sail aboard Corlys' flagship, the \"Queen Who Never Was\", to join the Velaryon blockade.\nAt Harrenhal\nSer Alfred Broome arrives as Rhaenyra's emissary and, surveying Daemon's large Riverman army, pledges to follow Daemon if he proclaims himself king. Overhearing their conversation, an alarmed Ser Simon Strong sends Rhaenyra a raven, warning that Daemon may be traitorous.\nAt night, Alys Rivers leads Daemon to the weirwood tree, saying he is ready to see his fate, if he wishes. Daemon touches the tree and sees visions of the future: Brynden Rivers becoming the Three-Eyed Raven, a White Walker leading an army of wights, a landscape of dead dragons, Daenerys Targaryen with her three dragon hatchlings, and Rhaenyra sitting on the Iron Throne. Helaena then appears to him, stating that Daemon now knows the full story and his role in it.\nRhaenyra and Addam arrive at Harrenhal on dragonback. Daemon reveals to Rhaenyra that he knows of the Song of Ice and Fire, and reaffirms his loyalty to her, bending the knee to her alongside the Riverman army; Broome retreats into the crowd.\nIn the Vale\nExhausted from scouting the harsh Vale countryside without sustenance or shelter, Rhaena finds the wild dragon as it devours sheep.\nAt Dragonstone\nAngered by Ulf's insolence, Jace threatens to hang him if he displays disloyalty or incompetence. Baela later empathizes with Jace, and expresses her concerns about civilian casualties, as does Rhaenyra. Mysaria counsels her to remain strong as she has a major tactical advantage. During supper, Rhaenyra promises knighthood to Addam, Hugh, and Ulf if they serve her well; she announces they leave",

    "American athlete (1905\u20131993)\nElizabeth Gertrude Stine Glasier (August 5, 1905 \u2013 November 15, 1993) was an American athlete, one of the thirteen members of the United States team at the 1922 Women's World Games in Paris. She won a silver medal in the long jump competition, and held world records for the hop, skip and jump, high jump, and running broad jump events in the mid-1920s.\nEarly life and education\nStine was born in New York City and raised in Teaneck, New Jersey, the daughter of Thomas Arthur Stine and Consuelo Frost Stine. Her father was president of the board of education of the Hackensack Public Schools, and her mother was active in local politics and the YMCA. She graduated from Leonia High School, as did her teammate Maybelle Gilliland. Their high school coach Suzanne Becker became assistant coach of the United States team for the 1922 Women's World Games.\nCareer\nStine set the world record for the hop, skip and jump event at the trials in Mamaroneck, New York, in 1922; she also placed in the high jump and the 100-yard dash at the trials. She told a 1922 newspaper that her goal was to be \"the world's greatest all-around woman athlete.\" She was one of the younger members of the United States team at the 1922 Women's World Games in Paris. She won a silver medal in the long jump competition, behind British athlete Mary Lines and ahead of her American teammate Camille Sabie.\nStine continued competing in track and field events after Paris. In 1923, she was credited with the world record in high jump, after jumping 4\u00a0feet 10+1\u20444\u00a0inches (1.480\u00a0m) in a county-wide competition held in Englewood, New Jersey. She won the running broad jump event at the Metropolitan AAU tryouts in 1925, and won the high jump at the Metropolitan AAU championships that year. In 1926, at the outdoor national championships in Philadelphia, she placed second in the running high jump. Her 1925 record for the running broad jump, 17\u00a0feet 1\u20442\u00a0inch (5.194\u00a0m), was broken in 1927 by Elta Cartwright. In 1928, she competed in the New Jersey state championships as a member of the Paterson Recreation Club. She was a member of the Millrose Athletic Association in 1931.\nPersonal life\nStine married businessman Frederick Charles Glasier in 1931; teammate Maybelle Gilliland was her maid of honor at the wedding.

    "Mountain in Montana, United States\nCrown Butte is a 10,225-foot (3,117-metre) summit in Park County, Montana, United States.\nDescription\nCrown Butte is located 2.7 miles (4.3\u00a0km) north-northwest of Cooke City, Montana, in the Beartooth Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. It is set within the New World Mining District and the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's west slope drains into headwaters of the Stillwater River, whereas the east slope drains into Miller Creek \u2192 Soda Butte Creek \u2192 Lamar River. Topographic relief is modest as the summit rises 1,225 feet (373 meters) above Miller Creek in one mile (1.6\u00a0km). The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. The area around Crown Butte from Cooke City to Scotch Bonnet Mountain offers some of the finest backcountry snowmobiling in the country. On January 17, 2009, a snowmobiler riding on Crown Butte triggered an avalanche resulting in one fatality. On December 31, 2022, one snowmobiler was killed in a very large avalanche on Crown Butte.\nCrown Butte in summer\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Crown Butte is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F.\nSee also\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Crown Butte, Montana\".

    "American writer\nOra Veralyn Eddleman Reed (September 17, 1880 \u2013 June 19, 1968), also known as Tucheta or Mignon Schreiber, was an American writer, editor and radio host. Though not officially enrolled, she is usually associated with the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, a connection she embraced in her writings and social interactions.\nEarly life and education\nEddleman was born near Denton, Texas, the daughter of David Jones Eddleman and Mary Jane Daugherty Eddleman. Mary Daugherty Eddleman identified as Cherokee and Irish by ancestry, but her 1908 application to be officially enrolled in the Cherokee Nation was rejected by the Dawes Commission. Ora V. Eddleman followed her mother's example in her public presentation as a Cherokee woman, and she maintained a \"lifelong connection to Cherokee leaders and to the larger Cherokee community\". She attended Henry Kendall College in Muskogee, Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), but left school to help with her family's newspaper business.\nCareer\nEddleman's family owned the Muskogee Daily Times, and she worked at the newspaper as a young woman. She was a co-founder and editor of Twin Territories: The Indian Magazine, a monthly publication, from 1898 to 1904. From 1905 to 1906, she edited the \"Indian Department\" of Sturm's Oklahoma Magazine. Her columns were noted for their humor. She also wrote short stories under the name \"Mignon Schreiber\". She published and promoted works by Native American authors including Mabel Washbourne Anderson, Charles Gibson, John Rollin Ridge, and Alexander Posey. She wrote an unpublished novel, Where the Big Woods Beckon, and an unadapted screenplay, Night Brings Out the Stars.\nReed was an active member of the Indian Territory Press Association. She was president of the Yellowstone chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1929 and 1931. She was also a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Oklahoma Historical Society. She became active in radio in Casper, Wyoming, in the 1930s, hosting a half-hour talk show and dispensing advice as \"the Sunshine Lady\". She has been described as \"the first Native American broadcaster\" and \"the first Native American talk show host\".\nPublications\n\"Lucy and I as Missionaries\" and \"Only an Indian Girl\" (1900, Twin Territories, stories; as Mignon Schreiber)\nStatus of Indian Schools (1902, report)\n\"Great Works of an Indian\" (1906, Sturm's, article)\n\"The Indian Orphan\" (1908, Sturm's)\n\"Modern Mistress Lo\" (1908, Harper's Bazaar, article)\n\"Billy Bearclaws, Aid to Cupid\" (1909, story)\n\"Daughters of the Confederacy\" (1910, Sturm's)\n\"A Toast\" (1914, short poem)\n\"Pioneer Publisher, First Daily in Indian Country\" (1945, The Chronicles of Oklahoma)\n\"The Robe Family: Missionaries\" (1948, The Chronicles of Oklahoma)\n\"What the Curious Want to Know\" (a regular column in Twin Territories)\n\"Types of Indian Girls\" (a regular feature in Twin Territories)\nPersonal life and legacy\nEddleman married fellow journalist Charles L. Reed in 1904; they had two sons, Roy and David, and two more children who died in infancy. Her husband worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and as a scout for oil companies. The Reeds moved to Wyoming in 1924, and back to Oklahoma in 1932. Her husband died in 1949, and she died in 1968, at the age of 87, at a nursing home in Tulsa. A collection of her selected works was published in 2024 by the University of Nebraska Press. The University of Oklahoma has a microfilm run of Eddleman's Twin Territories.\nReferences\n^ a b \"A Cherokee City Editor; Miss Tucheta B.

    "Belgian artist, sculptor (1873\u20131954)\nAdolphe Wansart, born October 18, 1873, in Verviers and died October 3, 1954 (aged 80) in Brussels, was a Belgian painter and sculptor.\nBiography\nAdolphe Wansart was the son of Brigadier Henri Guillaume Wansart and Henriette Marie Augustine Frazier. He received his education at the Academy of Li\u00e8ge. Recognizing his son's potential, his retired father decided to relocate the family to Brussels to further Adolphe's studies. Adolphe became a student of Jan Frans Portaels at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels. He made his debut as a painter at the Brussels Salon in 1893, where he won the Godecharle Prize for his drawing \"Wandering Souls.\" Adolphe eventually settled in Uccle.\nStarting in 1897, Adolphe Wansart worked in the studio of Charles Van der Stappen at the Brussels Academy, where he increasingly focused on sculpture while continuing to draw and paint. He created busts, memorials, funerary monuments, medals, and reliefs. Henri Kerels' monograph on Wansart lists a total of 85 works: 68 monuments, compositions, and portraits, 13 medals, and 4 pieces of copperware. Wansart also sculpted several pieces featuring his wife, the artist Lucie Desmet (1873\u20131943), whom he met at the Brussels Academy. One notable work, a bust of Lucie exhibited in 1925 at the Ghent Triennial Exhibition, was praised by art critic Leo Van Puyvelde. He described Wansart as an artist \"whose strong Portrait of his Wife is a magnificent example of the modern feeling for volume with solid surfaces and large lines, without too great a deviation from nature or too strict an attachment to reality.\" In 1927, Wansart moved with his wife and son, Eric, to Rueil-Malmaison, near Paris, while maintaining his studio in Uccle. He primarily designed in France but produced his works in Belgium.\nHis largest works were created for the city of Li\u00e8ge. The most notable is the 24-meter-long relief titled \"Li\u00e8ge, Arts et Sciences,\" which adorns the entrance to the Palais des F\u00eates, constructed for an international exhibition on water technology in 1939. This work is an allegorical representation of Li\u00e8ge, highlighting its industrial and cultural heritage. Another significant piece is a six-meter-high statue of a knight with a shield and sword (1948\u201350), carved from blue stone. This knight symbolizes the Burgundian Netherlands, one of the four historical periods depicted on either side of the Pont des Arches in Li\u00e8ge. Wansart passed away at the age of 80, and an avenue in Uccle was named in his honor.\nFootnotes\n^ Geboorteakte n\u00b0 1114, via FamilySearch.\n^ a b Henri Kerels (1955) Adolphe Wansart.

    "The NHK Hiroshima Broadcasting Station (NHK\u5e83\u5cf6\u653e\u9001\u5c40, NHK Hiroshima Hoso Kyoku) is a unit of the NHK that oversees terrestrial broadcasting in Hiroshima Prefecture. It is the head NHK station for the Chugoku region.\nHistory\nThe station was created on July 6, 1928, using the call sign JOFK and was promoted to a Central Radio Station on May 16, 1934.\nIt was heavily damaged due to the atomic bombs on August 6, 1945. The building was destroyed and 36 of its staff were killed by the blast. A member of the NHK Osaka Broadcasting Station was attempting to receive further details, fifteen minutes after the blast, the station was unconcactable. Surviving staff members gathered at a nearby station in Hara (now Gion) and resumed broadcasting the following day from an extra room available there. Broadcasts were reinstated on a definitive basis on August 29. NHK Radio 2 (JOFB) started broadcasting on September 10, 1945.\nNHK General Television broadcasts (JOFK-TV) started on March 21, 1956, and Educational Television broadcasts (JOFB-TV) on January 8, 1961. FM test broadcasts (JOFK-FM) were conducted on September 17, 1962, becoming regular two years later. On October 1, 1964, NHK General's Hiroshima station started color broadcasts and NHK Educational followed on March 20, 1966. Analog TV broadcasts finished on July 24, 2011.\nStatus of the NHK Hiroshima building at the time of the atomic bomb and aftermath\nPhotographs taken by the U.S. military of the Hatchobori area before and after the atomic bombing.

    "The Wedding traditions in Iraq is a range of cultural norms prescribing the ritual of performing wedding ceremonies in Iraqi society. This aspect of Iraqi life also reflects in the relationships between people and the ways in which they form lasting social bonds.\nOverview\nSpecifically, most marriages are traditionally arranged by parents without the bride and groom having met beforehand, although there are cases where a boy might notice a girl, and the boy's mother intervenes. Then, the girl's family is contacted to propose marriage, presenting her family and the boy to spark the curiosity of the girl's family. Subsequently, the girl's family will contact the boy's family and request that the groom come with his mother. Some families might even allow the bride and groom to get to know each other better before the wedding, deciding on the next steps accordingly. However, this entire process might not take place in some rural areas where the bride and groom could even be cousins.\nMashaiya\nThe next step after the initial arrangements is called \"Mashaiya\", during which the groom\u2019s family brings the eldest person from the family along with a number of male relatives and friends. The eldest person from the groom\u2019s family then asks the bride\u2019s father for her hand in marriage, followed by the groom\u2019s father making the request on behalf of his son. Desserts are usually served, and this formality typically takes a short time.\nFollowing this, the engagement party takes place, where the bride and groom exchange rings. This party is organized by the bride\u2019s family and attended by close relatives of both parties. If the venue is too small, only women might participate in the celebration.\nFormalizing the Marriage\nThen, the couple is supposed to marry legally in the presence of an authority, although they might not live together immediately afterward. In this phase, the man agrees to provide financial support or material compensation to the wife in the event of divorce or death. This arrangement usually takes place at a court, but some families might invite the judge to the bride\u2019s home for a traditional ceremony. For Sunnis, the bride wears a white dress or Jallabiya, and seven cups filled with white foods such as sugar, yogurt, cream, and honey, along with the Quran and a mirror, are placed in front of her. The judge then asks the bride if she agrees to the marriage through a series of traditional questions, repeating them three times before receiving her answer. The groom is then asked the same question only once.\nFor Shias, the bride wears a white dress, and seven plates are placed in front of her with various spices arranged beautifully. A Shia cleric, rather than a judge, conducts the ceremony. During this, two women hold a strip of cloth over the bride while a third sprinkles sugar on it, and the bride keeps her feet in a basin of water with dried flowers.\nNishan and Henna\nFollowing this ceremony is the \"Nishan\" party, which is another celebration organized by the bride\u2019s family at their home or at a venue. During this party, the groom\u2019s family gives the bride jewelry, either gold or diamonds, depending on their financial means, and the groom helps her adjust the jewelry.\nBefore the wedding day, separate parties are held at both the groom\u2019s and the bride\u2019s homes, where they invite their close ones, and \"henna\" is applied to the guests' hands. The Henna party is a special ritual that adds charm to the wedding, which traditionally lasts for seven days. During this party, the groom\u2019s family gives the bride an expensive gift called \"Sanchaq\", and the bride\u2019s hands and feet are painted with henna.\nThen comes the actual wedding celebration, which can vary in scale. Some families might hold a party with a band at the bride\u2019s house, while others might prefer a venue.\nThese traditions can, of course, vary depending on the environment (urban, rural), financial means, and location. In Mosul, for example, the wedding party is held on the fourth day after the ceremony. It is usually held at the groom\u2019s parents' house, with invitations coming only from the bride's side, and it is expected that women will bring gifts for the newlyweds. Only the bride typically participates in this party, with the groom waiting in a separate room until all the guests have left. The bride wears a party dress, sometimes multiple outfits, or starts the party in the white dress and changes outfits during the event.\nCurrently, despite the difficult situation in the region, weddings still take place, albeit with slight adjustments to the timing of the ceremonies. Instead of an evening celebration, families might now hold the event at noon to ensure the safety of their guests. Most newlyweds are no longer accustomed to spending their wedding night in Baghdad\u2019s hotels but might opt for staying at home or traveling to Kurdistan, for example.\nReferences\n^ \"Wedding Traditions in Iraq\".\n^ \"Wedding Traditions in Iraq\".\n^ \"ESL Student Tells of Iraqi Marriage Cus",
    "American historian (1916\u20132011)\nHelen Hornbeck Tanner (1916\u20132011) was an American advocate of Native American rights and a historian. She argued for Native Americans in court cases, and she documented the tribes of the Great Lakes in 1987. Tanner was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 2006. \nPersonal life and education\nTanner was born on July 5, 1916, in Northfield, Minnesota. She spent most of her childhood in Kalamazoo, Michigan. She graduated from Swarthmore College in 1937 with honors. Tanner earned a master's degree from the University of Florida in 1948. She married the psychologist Wilson Tanner in 1940 and they had four children. While living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Tanner earned a PhD in history from the University of Michigan in 1961. Tanner started studying the history of Native Americans in the early 1960s when she read tribe maps that had \"insufficient data\" or \"unknown tribes\".\nCareer\nBeginning in 1962, Tanner was a part of 16 Indian Claims Commission cases as an expert witness. Among such cases, Tanner worked in the case United States v. the State of Michigan to support the rights of Native Americans in fishing from the Great Lakes. Tanner summarized historical information about Native Americans and their fishing. Although her work was not often highly thought of by male historians and anthropologists, she was known as an authority on and friend of the Ojibwe and Odawa people who make their homes by the Great Lakes.\nTanner was a part of the University of Michigan's Center for Continuing Education for Women for four years. While working there as an associate director and then a director, Tanner helped about 2,000 women. She created a fellowship program for American Indian women. She was an instructor at the University of Michigan and was a senior research fellow at the Newberry Library in Chicago. From 1984 to 1985, Tanner was the interim director at D'Arcy McNickle Center for American Indian History at the Newberry Library. She was a member of the American Society for Ethnohistory. Tanner was placed in the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 2006 \"for achievement in history and American Indian rights\".\nTanner was given a National Endowment for the Humanities grant which allowed her to complete the Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History. The atlas was published in 1987. Margaret Ramirez of the Chicago Tribune said that it was \"hailed as the most comprehensive study of the region's Indian tribes\". She has also written books about the Caddo, the Ojibwe, and Spanish Florida in the early 18th century.\nWhile in her 80s, Tanner was a part of the major case Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians at the Supreme Court of the United States in 1999. The case involved Ojibwe people being mistreated for more than a century for hunting, fishing, and gathering in land that was theirs via treaty rights. The case was ruled in favor of the Ojibwe.\nDeath\nTanner died on June 15, 2011, due to heart failure at 94 years old near Beulah, Michigan.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Helen Hornbeck Tanner papers, 1930s-2009\".

    "\nThe coat of arms Sudbury is the heraldic symbol representing the city of Sudbury.\nSymbolism\nThe green colour is symbolic of growth and the environment. The gold can represent the mineral riches of the region and spirit of community.\nThe star indicates the north star and that the city is the main urban center of northeastern Ontario. It can symbolize dynamism, technology and the future as well. The mural crown is a traditional symbol of municipal authority, representing the city's responsibility to protect it's citizens. The pine cones make a second reference to the natural heritage of the area, and hint Sudbury's previous name\u00a0: Sainte-Anne-des-Pins.\nThe moose are animals symbolic of Northern Ontario as this is where Sudbury is located. The rocky compartement, itself representative of the strong and enduring principles on which the Sudburian community has been assembled, indicates the importance of mining in the area, and the blueberries suggest the local vegetation. The coronets represent the diverse Canadian and francophone heritage of the city.\nBlazon\nArms: Per fess sapin\u00e9 Vert and Or, in dexter chief a mullet Or;\nCrest: A mural crown Vert set with pine cones Or;\nSupporters: Two moose Or, that to the dexter gorged with a coronet erabl\u00e9, that to th\u00e9 sinister gorged with a coronet fleurelis\u00e9 Vert, both standing on \u00e0 mounty rock set with blueberry plants proper; \nMotto\nThe motto is adapted from the book of Nehemiah \"Come and let us build together\". In the passage, Nehemiah was asked by God to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem whom were crumbled. After appraising the damage, Nehemiah appreciated the job could not be made by him only, but by the Jerusalem citizens helping him with the reconstruction.\nIt has been said that Nehemiah was the first to practice inclusion. The motto would serve to recognize that building a community is a never ending task that citizens must contribute and continue. This motto is also a recognition of all those who have settled and built the Sudbury community we have inherited through their efforts.\nReferences\n^ City of Greater Sudbury Canadian Gazette (2005) Retrieved July 31, 2024.\n^ City Crest Greater Sudbury (2024) Retrieved July 31, 2024.\n",

    "Douglas James Shearman (2 July 1918, Isleworth, Middlesex \u2013 12 May 2003, Cassington, Oxfordshire) was a British geologist and sedimentologist, who made significant contributions to the study of evaporites and other sediments and sedimentary rocks in desert climates.\n His research on evaporites is important for understanding the entrapment and migration of petroleum.\nEducation and career\nAfter education in Hounslow and at Southend-on-Sea's Southend High School for Boys, Shearman joined the Royal Mail as a trainee engineer. In 1939 he enlisted in the Royal Navy. During his basic training in Dover he met in the NAAFI canteen a young soldier named Tom Pain, who was using a hand lens to examine a terebatulid fossil from the Dover chalk. Discussions over tea and doughnuts inspired Shearman to study geology. During WW II, he served as a radio operator on a minesweeper in the North Atlantic. In 1946 he enrolled at Chelsea Polytechnic, University of London, where he studied geology under William Fleet (1890\u20131966) and graduated in 1949 with a first class degree.\nIn 1949 Herbert Harold Read appointed Shearman as assistant lecturer at Imperial College London. There Shearman was promoted in 1951 to lecturer, in 1963 to senior lecturer, and in 1971 to reader. He was awarded a D.Sc. and was a professor of sedimentology from 1978 to 1983, when he retired from Imperial College London as professor emeritus.\nResearch\nFrom the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, Shearman and his sedimentology research group studied the limestones and dolomites of the French Jura. Shearman with his student Brian Evamy developed staining methods that improved microscopic study of the cementation history of limestones. Shearman and colleagues also pioneered the use trace elements and various methods to study dolomitisation and dedolomitisation of limestones. Their pioneering methods were adopted worldwide. During those years, Shearman's group also focused on research, initiated by Graham Evans (1934\u20132021), involving inter-tidal sediments of the Wash.\nIn 1961, Douglas J. Shearman and Graham Evans began to expand their research on tidal and inter-tidal sediments to areas outside England. During work, funded by the UK's DSIR and later by Shell plc, on the Trucial Coast on the Persian Gulf, Shearman's research team recorded the first known example of recent anhydrite. The team showed that anhydrite, previously known only from older rocks, is still being formed today, in tidal environments of what is now called the sabkha environment. In 1965 in a discussion in a joint meeting of the Institute of Petroleum and Geological Society of London, Shearman suggested that the traditionally accepted idea of evaporites deposited from a standing body of water was wrong. Instead, upward moving brines in a thick pile of sabkha sediments produce complex mineralogical replacements in the upper part of the pile whilst leaving the lower part unaltered \u2014 thus producing the vertical sequences found in these evaporite rocks. By the late 1970s the research of Shearman's team convinced sedimentologists that, as salt marshes build out toward the sea, evaporite minerals displace and replace earlier lime sediments. In addition to the research on the sabkha sediments, Shearman did related research in Baja California on inter-tidal laminated halite (salt) deposits and in Canada with John G. C. M. Fuller (1926\u20132012). Such research allowed sedimentologists to re-interpret ancient evaporite sequences, thus benefiting the petroleum industry. During his years of retirement, Shearman with colleagues did research in the sedimentary basins of Lake Lahontan and Mono Lake on algal mounds containing the mineral ikaite, precursor of various pseudomorphs of ikaite.\nFamily\nIn 1949 Douglas J. Shearman married Maureen Pugsley. Upon his death, he was survived by his widow and their two sons and one daughter.\nAwards and honours\nLyell Fund of the Geological Society of London (1967)\nMatson Award of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (1981)\nLyell Medal of the Geological Society of London (1984)\nWollaston Medal of the Geological Society of London (1997)\nSelected publications\nPitcher, W.

    "\nA selection of the characters from the series\nThe Shadows House manga series features an extensive cast of characters created by the manga artist duo Somato.\nLiving Dolls\nLiving Dolls (\u751f\u304d\u4eba\u5f62, Iki Ningy\u014d) are the servants of the Shadows, with each Shadow master having their own Doll. The Doll and their master have an identical silhouette and differ merely in their presence (or absence) of a face and their clothes. The Living Dolls are revealed to be humans that have all been abducted from a place called Mirrorside Village next to the Shadows House. Due to the Shadows House's production of charcoal for the village as an energy source, the villagers are all brainwashed into believing that letting their children work for the House is an ultimate bliss. All children from the village are trained by the school to be selected for by the third floor Shadows, with the exception of Emilico.\nEmilico\nVoiced by: Y\u016b Sasahara (Japanese); Dani Chambers (English)\nEmilico (\u30a8\u30df\u30ea\u30b3, Emiriko) is Kate's Living Doll, named after the protagonist of a storybook Kate enjoyed. Emilico is characterized by her cheerful, optimistic and kind demeanour, as well as her tendency to try and help anyone she can. Outside of being Kate's Living Doll, she is a member of Cleaning Squad 10 with Lou, Rosemary and Mia, and later becomes its leader. Despite sharing very different personalities, she and Kate get along very well. As they pry deeper into the secrets of the Shadows House, she begins to regain memories of her former life as a tightrope walker in a travelling circus, when she was invited to enter the House by Shaun, Lou, Ricky and Rum.\nShaun\nVoiced by: K\u014ddai Sakai (Japanese); Jordan Dash Cruz (English)\nShaun (\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30f3, Sh\u014dn) is an intelligent and steadfast boy who is John's Living Doll. While initially put under the effects of the brainwashing coffee, a fist-fight with John brings him back to his senses. He becomes Emilico and Kate's closest companion alongside his master as they rebel against the Shadows House.

    "1912 American film\nMiss Robinson Crusoe is a 1912 silent film romance-adventure produced by the Thanhouser Company starring Florence LaBadie and James Cruze. The narrative scenario is derived from Daniel Defoe's 1719 adventure novel Robinson Crusoe.\nPlot\nA well-to-do American couple are traveling abroad with their only daughter. When they discover that a young nobleman is courting her, they arrange for her to accompany the count and his mother on an ocean liner cruise bound for the tropics. The girl's parents hope that she will fall in love on the long voyage, with the prospect that marriage will follow. A wealthy young American has also fallen in love with their daughter. Lacking noble ancestry, the family discourages his advances.\nWhen news arrives that the cruise ship has been lost at sea, the girl is reported among the missing. Distraught, but refusing to believe the love of his life is dead, the American swain embarks on his yacht in search of her. Unbeknownst to him, the girl has survived the disaster and finds herself a castaway on a tiny island occupied solely by hostile indigenous people. The tribes consider killing the intruder, but hesitate when she handles an emormous, venomous snake and survives. The tribal leaders decide she is an enchanted goddess, and commence worshiping her.\nAfter traveling to many strange tropical lands, the young American begins to question if his search is hopeless. Persevering, he lands on a remote island and discovers his sweetheart. A prisoner in her own domain, the inhabitants are loath to relinquish her, and a violent struggle ensues between the young American and the natives to possess her. The couple escape and return home to the United States. The parents, overjoyed at reuniting with their only child, consent to their marriage.\n\nCast\nFlorence LaBadie as Miss Robinson Crusoe\nJames Cruze as her American recuser\nHenry Benham as an American\nFrancis \"Frank\" Newburgh as the Nobleman\nWilliam Russell\nMignon Anderson\n=Release\nFlorenceLaBadieMiss Robinson Crusoe was released October 8, 1912.\nThe film was issued on two reels. The first reel ran 1,210 feet. The second reel, a so-called \"split-reel\" completed the picture The remainder of the reel provided footage of animals from the New York Zoological Park.\nReception\n\"There is such variety to the plays that I never know what I may be called upon to do next. Not long ago I had the lead in Miss Robinson Crusoe. They left me floating on a log, so far out that, though I am a good swimmer, I really wondered if I'd ever get back to land.\"\u2014Florence LaBadie in Moving Picture Story Magazine, January 1913.\nA reviewer for The Moving Picture World, October 19, 1912, after a brief sketch of the plot, declared Miss Robinson Crusoe \"a highly artistic picture and, where it fails to be so, it is nevertheless effective, and makes a very desirable offering.\"\nThe reviewer adds that LaBodie's \"handling of a huge rattlesnake makes a most startling scene.\"\nA critic at The Morning Telegraph, October 13, 1912, noted the tropical settings in the film. Allowing that \"the photoplay is well carried out to the end,\" the review concluded by informing readers that \"A reel and a half are necessary for the tale.\"\nRetrospective appraisal\nLiterature and film critic Edward Wagenknecht declares that Miss Robinson Crusoe \"does not deserve to be memorialized; it must have been a terrible picture.\"\nWagenknecht, who viewed the film upon its release when he was a 12-year-old boy, recalls the film from his juvenile perspective:\n  I shall never forget it. The heroine (Florence LaBadie) was wrecked on a desert island, after which she appeared dressed in a leopard skin (as I remember it) and nothing more. A large brown snake approached her, and she picked it up and played with it...to my eyes that were not accustomed to seeing bare legs even on little girls she seemed startlingly and wonderfully naked, and her beautiful body combined with the horror of the snake created an impact that was unforgettable.\nNotes\n^ Bowers, 1995\n^ Bowers, 1995: Plot synopsis, based on The Moving Picture World, October 5, 1912.\n^ Bennett, 2023\n^ Wagenknecht, 1962 p. 59- 60: See extensive footnote no. 24\n^ Bowers, 1995\n^ Bowers, 1995\n^ Bowers, 1995\n^ Bennett, 2023\n^ Bowers, 1995\n^ Bennett, 2023\n^ Wagenknecht, 1962 p. 59: Ellipsis for brevity, clarity; theme not altered.\nReferences\nBennett, Carl. 2023.

    "View of Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo\nThe Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo, also known as the Palazzo del Podesta  is a late-Romanesque-Gothic architecture, late 13th-century civic palace located in Piazza del Popolo, in the historic center of Orvieto, region of Umbria, Italy. The palace now houses some municipal offices and the main hall is used for cultural events and meetings.\nSurrounding the Piazza del Popolo is also the palaces named for the Bracci and Simoncelli families, and the deconsecrated church of San Rocco.\nHistory and description\nThis was erected as a single story loggia in 1156 by pope Adrian IV as a papal palace (Palazzo Apostolico) adjacent to the church of San Bernardo. However, it suffered grave damage during the wars of the following century, and was restored by pope Alexander IV in 1255. Thereafter it served as the residence of the Podest\u00e0, and later the Captain of the People, both representing the supreme local magistrate representing the pope.\nThe structure was enlarged within ten years of its original construction and, in 1315, the bell tower was added and in the subsequent year, a great bell was hung there. The upper part of the structure was covered in 1472 and the large hall divided into two rooms, one large and the other small. The larger of the two occupied an area that corresponds approximately to the room known today as the Sala dei Quattrocento. Subsequently, the building functioned as a residence for the Capitano del Popolo, the Podest\u00e0 and the Signori Sette.\nThe reconstruction, using local pink tufa stone, created a rectangular hall as a piano nobile, standing upon five solid arcades. The second floor has six arches facing the Piazza del Popolo, four of which now have mullioned windows. The arches are flanked by a brick fretwork consisting of protuding bricks or voids, and surmounted with circular floral or geometric (plate tracery) in the tympanum. The arches are also flanked by  The second floor was accessed by a wide staircase, leading to a tribune or terrace from where the magistrate could speak to those assembled below. At one time the stairs and tribune were roofed. The stairs alter the palace from a fortress-like exterior to this open access that symbolize the citizen's new ease of entry to the Council Hall itself.\nFrom 1596 one of the lower-section rooms housed the Studium, which had been re-instituted a few years earlier by Lorenzo Magalotti. Students of law, theology and logic came here to study twice a day, each time the bell of Palazzo del Popolo rang, until 1651. Few records of this university appear after this date. Some sources indicate that it dates back to 1013 and had connections with names such as the Benedictine monks Graziano and Gozio of Orvieto.\nIn the 16th century, a scholarly society in Orvieto, known as the Accademia de Nobili, or of the Phoenix or of the Confusi; was allowed to build a small theater, designed by Sforzino da Todi and decorated by Ricciolini, in the palazzo. It was inaugurated during the visit of Queen Christina, Queen of Sweden.\nIn the ground floor of the Palazzo, facing the Piazza del Popolo, was once found the offices of the Monte di Pieta, a pawn shop lending money mainly to the poor. It was established in 1463 under bishop Marinonim and the Franciscan friar Fra Bartolomeo da Colle, and with the support of Pope Pius II. A plaque with antisemitic overtones at the site read: To relieve the poverty of the poor and to depress the usury of the Jews, This Monte di Pieta was permitted by Pius II and erected and endowed by Orvietan piety.\nReferences\n^ Guida Storico-artistica della citta di Orvieto, by Tomasso Piccolomini Adami, Tipografia Bernadini, Siena (1883); pages 211-213.\n^ Art and Architecture in Italy 1250-1400 by John White, Yale University Press, 1993, page 60.\n^ Adami, page 214.\n^ UT PAUPERUM INOPIAM SUBLEVARET ET IUDEORUM USURARIAM PRAVITATEM DEPRIMERET MONTEM HUNC PIETATIS PIO II.

    "The Girl as Soldier (German: Das M\u00e4dchen als Soldat) is a Russian folktale collected by Russian folklorist Ivan Khudyakov\u00a0, originally titled \"\u041e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0421\u043d\u043e\u0445\u0430\" (\"The Daughter-in-Law, Again\"). The tale features a heroine that masquerades her gender by adopting a male disguise, passing by tests designed to discover her gender, and is later kidnapped by her lover (or her lover's mother, in other tales); her lover's mother then forces the heroine to perform difficult tasks for her.\nSources\nThe tale was collected by Ivan Khudyakov from a source in the then-existing Ryazan Governorate, originally titled \"\u041e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0421\u043d\u043e\u0445\u0430\" (\"The Daughter-in-Law, Again\"). The tale was translated into German language by author August von L\u00f6wis de Menar with the title Das M\u00e4dchen als Soldat (\"The Girl as Soldier\").\nSummary\nA father has three daughters, and one day is drafted to war. His youngest daughter offers to go in his place, and wears the disguise of a male soldier. She joins the army and is lodged with another soldier and his mother. The soldier's mother suspects her son's friend is a woman underneath, and suggests they test her gender: first, she is to sleep on the grass, so that the way their body presses the leaves reveals their gender; next, she is to take a bath in the sauna with the soldier. The girl tricks the soldier in getting soap for her and takes a bath first. After the war ends, she returns home to her father.\nOne day, her friend, the soldier, appears at her house in the shape of a cat, places her on its back and carries her back home across the Oka river to his mother. The girl throws her ring in the water and makes a vow of silence to never address the soldier's parents, and marries him. The man's mother-in-law forces the heroine in dangerous tasks: to shear her gray sheep (who are gray wolves), then to go to the barn and milk her brown cows (who are bears), and lastly to get a reed (\"\u0431\u0451\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043c\", in the original; \"Weberkamm\", in the German translation) from her \"sister\". The heroine's husband warns her that his mother's \"sister\" is not a relative, but the witch Baba Yaga, who will devour her, so he gives her a piece of butter, a comb and a brush.\nThe heroine visits Baba Yaga in her chicken-legged hut and asks for the reed for her mother-in-law. Baba Yaga goes to sharpen her teeth. The heroine gives the piece of butter to a cat. The animal, in return, advises the girl to spit under the porch, so her saliva can answer for her, then take the reed and escape. The girl obeys the cat and flees from Baba Yaga's hut. The witch goes after her on her iron mortar, but the girl throws behind her the comb and the brush to create obstacles for her. After bringing the reed to her mother-in-law, she resigns herself to the fact that her daughter-in-law survived her every attempt. At the end of the tale, the girl fishes her ring out of the river.\nAnalysis\nTale type\nRussian scholarship classifies the tale as type SUS 428, \"\u0414\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0435 \u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c\u043c\u044b\" (\"The Girl in the Witch's Service\" or \"A girl serving a Witch\"), of the East Slavic Folktale Classification (Russian: \u0421\u0423\u0421, romanized:\u00a0SUS). According to scholar Andreas John and Russian folklorist Lev Barag\u00a0, in the East Slavic type, the heroine's mother-in-law (sometimes identified as witch Baba Yaga) sends her on dangerous tasks in order to get rid of her, but, with her husband's advice, she prevails: with the witch's son's advice, she milks cows (bears), shears sheep (devils), and pays a visit to a second witch in the other world by treating the objects with kindness.\nIn his monograph about Cupid and Psyche, Swedish scholar Jan-\u00d6jvind Swahn\u00a0 acknowledged that Russian type 428 was subtype 425A of his analysis, that is, \"Cupid and Psyche\", being the \"oldest\" and containing the episode of the witch's tasks. In the international index, however, Swahn's typing is indexed as type ATU 425B, \"The Son of the Witch\".\nCombinations with other types\nFelix Karlinger considered the tale a combination of \"heterogeneous\" subjects: the girl as soldier and the demonic mother-in-law. In this regard, Jan-\u00d6jvind Swahn, in his work about Cupid and Psyche and other \"Animal as Bridegroom\" tales, surmised that, in \"Slavonic tradition\", tales of type Aa 428 involve a sequence named \"The Girl as a Soldier\" or \"The Girl At War\", wherein the heroine wears a male disguise, joins with a compatriot who tries to unmask her gender, and eventually marries him. The tale then segues into her mother-in-law's attempts to kill her by setting ludicrous tasks for her. In addition, the East Slavic Folktale Index classified this sequence (heroine masquerading as a male soldier and the tests to her gender) as tale type SUS 884B*, \"\u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430-\u043f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430\" (\"Vasilisa-popovna\").\nVariants\nThe East Slavic Folktale Catalogue, last updated by Russian folklorist Lev Barag\u00a0 in 1979, registers 12 variants. Karelian and Russian scholarship agree that the paucity of registers indicates the \"rarity\" of this tale type.\nRussia\nVasilisa Vasilievna (Nizhny Novg",

    "American creative communications company\nISO Supremacy (an acronym for In Search Of Supremacy), is an American independent multidisciplinary creative communications company. Founded by singer Brent Faiyaz and his childhood friend Darren Xu in 2023, it specializes in music and visual and sonic art.\nHistory\n2015\u20132023: Background and launch\nIn 2015, Faiyaz and his manager, Ty Baisden, founded the label Lost Kids, under which he released his debut and sophomore album, Sonder Son (2017) and Wasteland (2022).  In Faiyaz's June 2024 interview with Billboard, he elaborated on why he wanted to stay independent throughout his career:It kills me when labels sign an artist knowing who that artist is creatively, but then they try to dictate their music and other things. Nothing is going to stifle your creativity more than having to say yes to some lame shit that you don\u2019t want to do or being told no to some really cool shit that you want to do. It's really no deeper than that for me. So I went with my gut.\nIn May 2023, it was announced that ISO Supremacy would be a partnership with UnitedMasters and Steve Stoute in a deal valued at approximately $50 million. Stoute stated that \"It\u2019s been inspiring to watch  journey as an artist over the years, and with this partnership we look to further amplify his creative vision and support his entrepreneurial ambitions\". The company was officially founded on August 16, 2023, alongside the release of the music video for \"Jackie Brown\", the first release under the company. In the announcement, it was stated that the company is not only a record label and was described as \"a creative network with the mission of executing visual and sonic art\". On August 21, 2023, it was revealed that the company signed a joint venture music deal with Josh Abraham's Pulse Records\u2014a publishing subsidiary of Concord Music Group\u2014and that Tommy Richman would be the label's first signee.

In launching my new label ISO Supremacy and partnering with PULSE Records, we\u2019ve created this platform to give artists like Tommy Richman a creative home with the ability to scale global impact and a team that is accessible who keeps creativity at the forefront. We\u2019re going to continue to make history.\nOn October 27, 2023, Faiyaz released his solo mixtape, Larger than Life as the first official release under the company and label.\n2024\u2013present: Breakthrough\nThroughout the first and second quarters of 2024, Faiyaz released several music videos from his aforementioned mixtape, Larger than Life, accompanied by several singles from Richman.

    "Mountain in Montana, United States\nSheep Mountain is a 10,608-foot (3,233-metre) summit in Park County, Montana, United States.\nDescription\nSheep Mountain is located 3.75 miles (6.04\u00a0km) north of Cooke City, Montana, in the Beartooth Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. It is set within the New World Mining District and the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's northwest slope drains into Goose Creek which is a tributary of the Stillwater River, whereas the other slopes drain into Fisher Creek and Lady of the Lake Creek which together form the headwaters of the Clarks Fork Yellowstone River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises approximately 1,650 feet (503 meters) above Fisher Creek in one mile (1.6\u00a0km). The area from Cooke City to Sheep Mountain offers some of the finest backcountry snowmobiling in the country. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. This peak should not be confused with the other Sheep Mountain also in Park County, Montana, but in the Absaroka Range.\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Sheep Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F.\nSee also\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Sheep Mountain, Montana\".

    "Mark A. Goldman is an attorney and real estate entrepreneur who is notable for his work on the Marvin v. Marvin palimony case in the 1970s, as well as his co-founding of a real estate company in Southern California.\nMarvin v. Marvin case\nGoldman was co-counsel for actor Lee Marvin in Marvin v. Marvin, a case that spanned through the 1970s. Michelle Triola, Marvin's ex-live-in girlfriend, sued Marvin for the equivalent of spousal support, or \"palimony\". Triola's attorney, Marvin Mitchelson, vowed to show that \"an unmarried couple lives exactly like a married couple\" and were subject to the same property laws upon separation; in response, Goldman agreed that the trial would \"test  acceptance of alternative lifestyles.\" Mitchelson said that the case \"is going to affect everyone who ever has a date\", according to the Associated Press.\nGoldman authored the legal briefs for Marvin in the case. His California Supreme Court brief received praise from the court in a footnote, which stated: \"We wish to commend the parties and amici for the exceptional quality of the briefs and argument in this case.\"\nThe high court's decision gave Michelle Triola, actor Marvin's ex-girlfriend, an opportunity to prove they had an oral agreement for her post-relationship support. Goldman vowed that his client Marvin would \"make no effort\" to settle the suit but would instead go to trial against Triola. He told the Washington Post, \"If you want to get rid of a partner, if you want to break up, it's much smoother to get married now because there are established court procedures. This is a much dirtier fight... The claims are getting more farfetched. These are bedroom contracts. There are never any witnesses.  There's never any corroborating evidence. Some of the claims may be legitimate, but there's no way to distinguish the frivolous from the legitimate.\"\nGoldman estimated that Marvin's attorneys dedicated $300,000 worth of time to the case, plus expenses. After the conclusion of the trial, Goldman told the press, \"Judge Marshall has totally sustained Lee Marvin's position.\" Marvin himself called the result \"sensational\". Though Goldman and the rest of Marvin's trial team maintained \"a low profile in contrast to Mitchelson's high one\", Goldman's comments to the press during the trial were praised as \"disarmingly blunt\".\nGoldman also testified at a state Senate Judiciary Hearing concerning a bill to limit the effect of the Supreme Court's ruling; the bill did not pass. Goldman had opined that the bill would give rise to fraudulent claims.\nThe Real Estate Exchange\nOn January 3, 1977, Goldman co-founded the Real Estate Exchange with partners Jack Guber and Myles B. \"Skip\" Zeleny.

    "American anti-suffrage organization\nThe Illinois Association Opposed to the Extension of Suffrage to Women (IAOESW) was an influential organization in the state of Illinois that actively campaigned against the extension of voting rights to women. Founded in 1897 by Caroline Fairfield Corbin, the association played a significant role in the anti-suffrage movement in the United States.\nHistory\nThe Illinois Women Remonstrants, a loosely organized group led by Caroline Fairfield Corbin, was established in 1886. Despite Illinois passing school suffrage for women in 1891, the scope of this measure was limited due to contested interpretations and repeated challenges in the Illinois Supreme Court.\nBetween 1893 and 1897, several township suffrage bills were introduced but were defeated three times. This period of legislative activity and the perceived security of the legislature may have contributed to the mobilization of anti-suffrage groups.\nIn 1897, in response to increasing suffrage activism, including a series of meetings held by the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) throughout Illinois that year, the Illinois Women Remonstrants restructured into the Illinois Association Opposed to the Extension of Suffrage to Women (IAOESW).\nThe IAOESW was modeled after similar anti-suffrage organizations in Massachusetts and New York. It was part of a broader national anti-suffrage movement that included state-level organizations cooperating with each other and with male anti-suffragists who provided legal and political advice.\nDuring this period, Caroline Corbin emerged as the primary author of literature from the antisuffrage organization, representing the group's views individually rather than as a collective entity. Reflecting on the women's suffrage movement, she describes the emergence of antisuffragists as follows:A new force was preparing to enter the field. For forty years, the quiet, home-loving women of America had been observing the developments in the woman suffrage movement, forming deeply held convictions about it. They perceived the push for woman suffrage as an attempt to add to their already significant domestic responsibilities the duties that men had traditionally shouldered, based on a belief in a divinely ordained division of labor between the sexes. Though these women were not inclined towards public action or conventions, their moral convictions compelled them to make significant sacrifices in opposition to what they viewed as a threat.Like their suffrage counterparts, antisuffragists were also drawn from elite circles.\nIn 1908, they went on to say that \"during these ten years the suffragists have not gained a single important victory, while legislative records show against them more than one hundred and fifty defeats, covering the ground of municipal, State and presidential or national suffrage.\nAssociation's downfall\nOn April 14, 1909, the Illinois Senate committee, chaired by Senator Breidt, favorably reported a crucial bill for statewide women's suffrage, introduced by Senator Billings and endorsed by several senators. Despite opposition from anti-suffrage advocates like Mrs. Caroline F. Corbin, Miss Mary Pomeroy Green, and Miss Jessie Fairfield, who argued against expanding suffrage, the bill advanced for full Senate consideration. The events marked a notable step forward for the suffrage movement, despite the legislative chaos and opposition encountered.\nGrace Wilbur Trout moved to Chicago in 1893. By 1900, she had immersed herself in numerous clubs, encouraging their members to join the suffrage movement. By 1910, she had emerged as one of the state's leading suffrage advocates. Elected president of the Chicago Political Equality League (CPEL), Trout quickly revitalized the previously stagnant movement. She pushed clubwomen into the suffrage movement and became one of the state's foremost suffrage leaders by 1910. Trout was elected president of the CPEL and quickly revitalized the somewhat stagnant movement.\nTrout became president of the Illinois Equal Suffrage Association in 1912 and led them until 1920 when the group disbanded, except for the year 1915\u20131916. Trout embraced attention-grabbing stunts that would bring suffrage news to the press. Within her first few years of leadership, Trout organized suffrage floats for parades, automobiles.\nTrout actively built alliances to ensure support for suffrage legislation in 1913. She secured Governor Edward F. Dunne's backing before drafting the bill for the General Assembly. Despite challenges, including an unsuccessful amendment by Catharine Waugh McCulloch, Trout managed to push the bill through. On June 11, 1913, she effectively defended the bill from anti-suffrage opposition, leading to the passage of the Presidential and Municipal Voting Act, which extended voting rights to women for most offices. However, post-victory, the suffrage movement in Illinois became dominated by upper-class leaders, creating a rift between Trout's f",
    "West Slavic ethnolect\nA map based on isoglosses within the Goral dialect group\nGoral, rarely called Highlander or Highland Polish, is an ethnolect of the Lechitic group, more specifically of the Lesser Poland dialect group spoken by the Gorals. Its vocabulary was significantly influenced by many languages like Slovak, Rusyn, Hungarian, Romanian and German, being common vocabulary of the Carpathian region. Some consider Goral to be a microlanguage, alongside Silesian and to a lesser extent Masurian.\nThe term Goral was first used in reference to the ethnolect by Pavol Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik in his book Slowansk\u00e9 staro\u017eitnosti, and the term derives from the Slavic word for mountain (g\u00f3ra, hora) and the noun-forming suffix denoting people -al.\nDue to their isolation, Goral dialects have many influences from Slovak, diverging significantly from the Polish literary standard and other dialects. The resulting system is also quite resilient to effects from Standard Polish, showing a more stable, unique system when compared to other Polish dialects. It is often equated to the Podhale dialect; however, this is only one of the many Goral dialects.\nTranscription\nGoral orthography is fairly unstandardized and may vary significantly dialect-to-dialect, most notably in the writing of the slanted vowels.\n^ used after sibilants to show a lack of palatalization\nPhonology\nThere is a tendency to reduce the number of phonemes in the phonological system of Goral, usually by raised the historic slanted vowels, by merging certain consonants, and by simplifying many consonant clusters.\nVowels\nA few vowel systems may occur throughout Goral, with one being the most dominant.\n^ Preserved in most dialects, but may merge in Liptov, Pohorel\u00e1, Horelica na Kysuciach, and the Star\u00e1 \u013dubov\u0148a District, where it approaches phonetically \n^ Preserved in Pohorel\u00e1, otherwise merges with y or i\n^ Preserved in most dialects, but merges with /\u0254/ in Liptov, Horelica na Kysuciach, and the Star\u00e1 \u013dubov\u0148a District, with /u/ in Babia G\u00f3ra or replaces Polish nasals in the Pog\u00f3rze Goral dialects\n^ Now rare, generally merged with /\u0254/\nConsonants\n^ a b c d Typically merged with /t\u0361s d\u0361z s z/ due Masuration, or is the result from a loss of /r\u031d/\n^ a b c d May be hardened towards  due to Slovak influence\n^ often becomes /\u0282/ (after voiceless consonants) or /\u0290/ (after voiced consonants) in many dialects\nGrammar\nThere is a strong tendency to level the multiple inherited declension patterns in Goral.\nThe first person present/future singular of verbs is most commonly formed across the whole region with -m as a result of Slovak influence: bedem/bedym, idem/idym (Standard Polish b\u0119d\u0119, id\u0119). These forms can also be reinforced via levelling of paradigms such as m\u00f3c > mozym, however, this is not a uniform process, and forms such as mogymy without the g||z alternation are also present. Forms such as bede in some regions, but often -m is preferred by the younger generation. Most dialects form the first person present/future plural of verbs with -me, also the result of Slovak influence.\nMany dialects, namely Kysuce, Spisz, and parts of Orawa, level both mobile-e declensions as well as ablaut: zymb > zymba (Standard Polish z\u0105b > z\u0119ba); lyn > lynu (Standard Polish len > lnu).\nThe comparative is generally formed with -sy instead of -ejszy.\nThe complex gender system of Polish distinguishing masculine personal, masculine animal, and masculine inanimate nouns is also levelled, whereby the plurals of masculine personal nouns are replaced with the plurals of masculine animal nouns, but the masculine virile plural forms of past tense verbs replace non-virile forms: hlopi robili, baby robili. Similarly, the feminine form of dwie is replaced with dwa: dwa baby.  A similar process of levelling occurs in eastern Slovak dialects, as well as most Polish dialects.\nIn southern Spi\u0161, many feminine nouns ending in -w are extended with mobile e: kerwi (Standard Polish krwi).\nHistory and culture\nPolish Wikisource has original text related to this article:\nAndrzej Stopka Nazimek \nPolish Wikisource has original text related to this article:\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Orkan \nPolish Wikisource has original text related to this article:\nKazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer \nGoral has a rich literary tradition reaching back to the 19th century with notable authors such as W\u0142adys\u0142aw Orkan, Andrzej Stopka Nazimek or Kazimierz Przerwa Tetmajer. Other sites exist, such as hawok.pl, a news site written in Goral and about Goral affairs.\nThe history of Goral stretches back to the XIII century. The area was initially fully part of Vistulia and later Poland in the Middle Ages but was at the time very sparsely populated, with the possible exceptions of the Dunajec and Poprad valleys where the locals spoke a Lechitic dialect related to the Muszyna dialect and similar to Eastern Slovak explaining the many similarities in lexicon and partially phonology. This promoted settlement from the 13th to 17th century by Lesser Polish peasants, Germans and notabl",

Upon confusion of her birthplace and nationality, she cleared the case by providing proof to the authorities. She is currently studying international relations at the University of Pretoria. Her participation in the Miss South Africa pageant has been surrounded by controversy, with some calling for her removal due to her citizenship and eligibility concerns.\nPageantry\nMiss South Africa 2024\nAdetshina was competing in Miss South Africa 2024,  reaching the top 11 finalists. When the investigation where conducted by The Department of Home affairs about the background of her mothers citizenship, She withdrawn herself from the pageant, citing a fear about her safety and well-being. After few days after the launch of Adetshina's mother background investigation, the Department of Home Affairs found preliminary evidence of fraud and Identity theft committed by Adetshina's mother to obtain South African citizenship in 2001.   It was claimed that she was unable participate in the contest due to her mixed heritage.\nControversy\nAdetshina's citizenship of South Africa and Nigeria raised questions about her eligibility to represent South Africa in the Miss South Africa pageant. The South African Department of Home Affairs launched an investigation following a request from the pageant organizers to verify Adetshina's citizenship. The probe revealed prima facie evidence suggesting that her mother may have stolen the identity of a South African woman 23 years ago to secure citizenship for Adetshina. Home Affairs plans to press criminal charges against all implicated parties once the investigation is complete.\nShe received support from many individuals who viewed her as an embodiment of South Africa's diverse population. Prominent figures and organizations publicly defended her, advocating for an end to xenophobic sentiments and promoting inclusivity for all South Africans, including the EFF. A further controversy arose when a video surfaced online showing Adetshina celebrating her progress in the pageant with her Nigerian family members.\nHome Affairs Minister, Leon Schreiber confirmed that the department will investigate the nationality of Adetshina only after her family requested it.\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a political party, expressed its support for Adetshina and accused the Miss South Africa organization of being xenophobic and discriminatory against black Africans. The African National Congress (ANC) called for clarity on Adetshina's citizenship status and the pageant's eligibility criteria.\nThe controversy sparked a wider debate about citizenship, identity, and representation in South Africa, with some arguing that Adetshina's citizenship does not disqualify her from representing the country, while others believed that she should not be allowed to compete due to her Nigerian heritage.\nThe Department of Home Affairs resolved the dispute over Adetshina's nationality. In an interview with Clement Manyathela on 702 news, the home Affairs Deputy minister Njabulo Nzuza sought to clarify the citizenship status of Adetshina, addressing the controversy emphasizing that he was bound by confidentiality and couldn't disclose sensitive information about any individual, including Adetshina. Nevertheless, he proceeded to explain the fundamentals of citizenship, as outlined in the Citizenship Act, which can be obtained through birth, heritage, or naturalization. He elaborated that citizenship is typically acquired through either one's place of birth or lineage and further explained that when one is born in a country, they are considered a citizen by soil, and if they inherit it through their parents, it's by blood.\nMinister of Sports, Arts, and Culture, Gayton McKenzie, was criticised for his xenophobic and afrophobic comments when he congratulated a European descent, Tatjana Smith, over an African descent Adetshina. Some sources claim the minister said that Adetshina could not be accepted as a South African because she has Nigerian names even if she was born in the country, which contradicts the Citizenship Act Laws of South Africa. He further stated that there is no way a Nigerian and Mozambican descent could represent South Africa in Miss South Africa contest, despite the fact that Bryoni Govender, an Indian descent, was accepted as Miss Universe South Africa 2023 despite her mixed descence.

    "Der Hengst Houssan (English: \"The Stallion Houssan\") is a Sudanese folktale from Kordofan, first collected in German by ethnologist Leo Frobenius and published in 1923.\nIt is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 314, \"Goldener\". Although it differs from variants wherein a hero acquires golden hair, its starting sequence (persecution by the hero's stepmother) is considered by scholarship as an alternate opening to the same tale type.\nSummary\nA sultan has a wife who gives birth to a son, while a mare in the stables gives birth to a male foal. The sultan's son and the foal grow up as best friends and companions. One day, the sultan's wife dies and he marries another woman. The second wife gives birth to her son and decides to get rid of her step-son. The sultan's first son, named Schatr Mohammed, comes  home after school and pets his horse. One day, the horse, named Houssan, cries and warns the boy that his step-mother intends to kill him. She first tries to poison the boy's food, then gives him a new clothe laced with magic, but he declines the offer on both occasions. A slave tells the step-mother of the deep affection there is between the boy and his horse, and deduces the horse is helping him. With a trusted doctor's aid, she feigns illness and demands the horse be put down and its liver given to her as cure. Schatr Mohammed learns of his stepmother's ploy from his horse, and tells his father he wants to ride it one last time.\nThe next day, the sultan allows his son to saddle and ride Houssan, while the stepmother secretly orders her slaves to attack the boy. Houssan takes its riders beyond his father's city gates, and rides through the desert to another city. They stop before the gates; the horse tells the boy to take off his rich garments and find shabby one, and take seven hairs from its mane, which he can use to summon the horse whenever he wishes. Schatr Mohammed enters the city in his new identity, and finds work with the royal gardener as his assistant. One day, while there is a festival in the city, Schatr Mohammed seizes the opportunity to ride Houssan in secret, since everyone has gone to the festival. What he does not know, however, is that the sultan's seventh daughter watches him undress, take a bath and ride the horse. She begins to be fond of the gardener, and goes down to the garden to give him some food. After three years, the sultan's eldest daughter announces her plans to marry, and the sultan organizes a festival where his seven daughters are to select their husbands by throwing a kerchief to them. The sultan's six elder daughters choose respectable suitors, but the seventh does not throw her kerchief to any one the passing men. The sultan brings the gardener and the apprentice, and the princess gives him the kerchief. The sultan becomes enraged and exiles his daughter and her lowborn husband to the slaves' quarters.\nOne day, an enemy sultan arrives with his army and prepares to invade the city. The sultan summons his six sons-in-law to lead the army and protect the city. The battle is fierce and they barely resist, when Schatr Muhammed comes in riding his horse Houssan and makes the enemy army retreat. He then rides back to his wife, changes his clothes and feigns ignorance about recent events. The next day, the princess tells her husband that the sultan, her father, will go to the battlefield to discover the identity of their mysterious knight (Faris) and lead their army to victory. This becomes a fallible strategy, as the enemy king's troops close in on him to take him prisoner, but once more Schatr Mohammed appears in the nick of time to ward off the enemy army and defend his father-in-law. He is hurt in his arm, and the sultan closes the wound with a cloth. Schatr Mohammed races back to his wife in the city, now that the threat is over.\nLater, the sultan announces that the Faris will inherit the kingdom, whoever he is. Schatr Mohammed goes to sleep in his shabby room, and his arm begins to bleed. His wife, the princess, notices the bleeding and rushes to her mother. The princess's mother goes to the slaves' quarters to heal him, and sees that the sultan's cloth is wrapped in his arm. His identity discovered, the princess's mother alerts the sultan, who summons him to his chambers as soon as he awakes. Schater Mohammed awakes, learns of this, and goes to his father-in-law's palace riding on Houssan.\nAnalysis\nTale type\nThe tale is classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as type ATU 314, \"The Goldener\": a youth with golden hair works as the king's gardener. The type may also open with the prince for some reason being the servant of an evil being, where he gains the same gifts, and the tale proceeds as in this variant.\nIntroductory episodes\nScholarship notes three different opening episodes to the tale type: (1) the hero becomes a magician's servant and is forbidden to open a certain door, but he does and dips his hair in a pool of gold; (2) the hero i",
    "Ancient Roman senator\nPublius (or Gaius) Annius Asellus was a senator of Ancient Rome who had not been included in the census\u2014that is, avoided a correct reckoning of his true wealth\u2014and died, leaving his only daughter to be his heir (or heres). We know of him almost entirely from a single anecdote of Cicero's in his In Verrem. Scholars do not agree on whether we ought to understand this to have been a deliberate obfuscation or a simple coincidence owing to the timing of the census.\nThe property, however, was seized by Verres, the praetor urbanus, on the grounds that such a bequest was in violation of the Lex Voconia, and regardless of the fact that it had not been reckoned in the census as being above the threshold to qualify as being in scope for that law.\nReferences\n^ Evans, John K.

    "Protected area in Dongying, China\nThe Yellow River Delta National Nature Reserve (YRDNNR) is a protected area in the city of Dongying, China, which covers wetland habitats on the shore of the Bohai Sea. These wetlands are formed through the deposition of silt by the Yellow River, forming a large and growing delta. The reserve is split geographically into two portions, one covering the current mouth of the Yellow River and one covering wetlands that remain near a former river mouth. In management terms, it is divided into a core area with a high level of protection, and buffer and experimental zones which allow for greater human activity.\nThe current river delta area only became widely settled in the 20th century. The discovery of the Shengli Oil Field brought significant economic activity to the area, and the city of Dongying was founded in 1983. The wetland ecosystem was degraded by the impact of economic activity within what became Dongying, as well as by inland agriculture which reduced water levels in the Yellow River. To preserve the wetland habitats, a process began to establish the YRDNNR, and the reserve was fully designated in 1992. The reserve now serves as a location for research and tourism, with one attraction being the \"carpet\" of red Suaeda salsa plants in autumn. There are plans to expand the reserve and convert it into a national park.\nThe wetland habitats within Dongying are crucial for bird species, supporting breeding populations as well as birds migrating along the East Asian\u2013Australasian Flyway and the West Pacific Flyway. It is an especially important location for the protected Oriental stork, hosting the species\u2019 largest breeding population. Other species for which these wetlands form a crucial habitat include Saunders's gull and the Siberian crane.\nBackground\nThe delta shifting from 1989 to 2009\nThe route of the Yellow River has shifted throughout history.:\u200a2\u200a The river shifted to its current course depositing silt into the Bohai Sea in 1855, having previously flowed into the ocean further south. The precise location of the mouth of the river shifted 50 times since then, reaching its current position in 1976.:\u200a1\u200a\nHuman settlement of the current delta began in 1898, with heavy cultivation and population growth beginning in 1934. Local governments used the area for forestry and farming, resulting in some damage to the wetland ecosystem and an eventual loss of farmland due to land reclamation increasing soil salinity.:\u200a3\u20134\u200a The northern Diaokou River became separated from the main Yellow River in 1976.:\u200a2403\u200a The city of Dongying was created on 1 October 1983, incorporating several existing local jurisdictions.:\u200a3\u20134\u200a\nIn December 1990 the Yellow River Delta Municipal Nature Reserve was created, becoming the Dongying Yellow River Delta Provincial Nature Reserve in November 1991 and then the Shandong Yellow River Delta National Nature Reserve in October 1992:\u200a3\u200a upon approval by the State Council.:\u200a17\u200a The Shandong Yellow River Delta National Nature Reserve Administrative Bureau was then set up in December 1992.:\u200a3\u200a The borders that were created sought to minimize overlap with facilities used to exploit the Shengli Oil Field, a crucial driver of the local economy:\u200a8\u200a and one of China\u2019s most important oil fields.\n:\u200a12\u200a\nToday Dongying has 4,567.73 square kilometres (1,763.61\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of wetlands, about 41.58% of the area within the city\u2019s jurisdiction.:\u200a17\u200a The wetland areas extend beyond the protected reserve, and include both urban and rural inhabited and industrial spaces.:\u200a4\u200a:\u200a2\u200a\nGeography\nThe Yellow River delta on 24 October 2020\nThe YRDNNR lies within the northeast of the administrative boundaries of the city of Dongying, where the city meets Laizhou Bay and the wider Bohai Sea, between 118\u00b033\u2019-119\u00b020\u2019E and 37\u00b035\u2019-38\u00b012\u2019N. It covers 131 kilometres (81\u00a0mi) of coastline, which has a tidal range that varies from 0.46 metres (1.5\u00a0ft) to 1.78 metres (5.8\u00a0ft). This area is the end-point of the Yellow River, and the park\u2019s 153,000 hectares (380,000 acres) includes the river mouth, although it does not cover the entire delta.:\u200a1\u200a There are two unconnected areas making up the park, one at the current river mouth on the city\u2019s eastern coast and a smaller area on the city\u2019s northern coast.:\u200a4\u200a The portion to the north is located at the mouth of the Diaokou River, an older course of the Yellow River. The monsoon continental climate is warm and temperate with four seasons averaging 11.9\u00a0\u00b0C (53.4\u00a0\u00b0F) and an average annual relative humidity of 68%.

    "\n2024 video game\nDiablo IV: Vessel of Hatred is an upcoming major expansion pack for the action role-playing dungeon crawling game Diablo IV. It is scheduled to release on October 8, 2024, for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S, and Windows.\nSet in the newly introduced region of Nahantu, a jungle overrun by corruption and dark forces, Vessel of Hatred explores new narratives and challenges within the Diablo universe. The expansion introduces the Spiritborn class, a versatile new character with abilities derived from ancient jungle warriors. Players also experience a new endgame dungeon designed for cooperative play, alongside an array of new items, abilities, and enhancements to the Paragon system. The expansion aims to deepen the lore of Sanctuary, continuing the story of Diablo IV and expanding its world.\nGameplay\nVessel of Hatred expands the core gameplay of Diablo IV. The new region, Nahantu, is a jungle environment with new enemies, including monstrous insects and corrupted humanoids, each with distinct attack patterns. The environment includes dense foliage and hazardous terrain.\nThe expansion includes a new endgame dungeon designed for cooperative play. This multi-phase challenge requires players to coordinate their abilities and strategies to overcome waves of enemies and bosses. Successful completion of the dungeon rewards players with loot and titles. Itemization includes new legendary items and aspects that provide new bonuses and effects for specialized builds. Furthermore, the Paragon system has been enhanced with additional boards and glyphs, offering further opportunities for character customization.\nSpiritborn class\nThe Spiritborn is a new class introduced in the upcoming Diablo IV expansion, Vessel of Hatred. This class draws on the powers of ancient jungle warriors from the Nahantu clan and excels in both ranged and melee combat. Spiritborn abilities are designed to focus on crowd control, mobility, and sustained damage output.\nThe Spiritborn class\nThe Spiritborn class features the ability to summon various Spirit Guardians, each providing distinct abilities. For instance, the Jaguar Spirit, known as Rezoka, grants abilities such as Rake, Ravager, and Rushing Claw, which inflict substantial fire damage. The Gorilla Spirit offers immense strength and resilience, enhancing both damage output and survivability. The Eagle Spirit improves agility and precision, allowing for swift and accurate strikes, while the Centipede Spirit provides speed and poison damage.\nA notable aspect of the Spiritborn class is its access to the Spirit Realm, a ghostly reflection of Sanctuary created by the prophet Akarat and his acolyte Ysevete. In the Spirit Realm, players can embody Spirit Guardians, gaining their full strength and unique abilities to confront various threats. The class also introduces new mechanics such as the Incarnate Skill, which enables players to embody the traits of their chosen Spirit Guardian, offering both passive bonuses and powerful active abilities. Additionally, the Spirit Hall is a special location where players can commune with their Spirit Guardians to enhance their abilities. The Spiritborn class features a new resource system that allows for strategic play and customization.\nPlot\nNahantu, the new region in Diablo IV\nNahantu, the new region in Vessel of Hatred, is a jungle corrupted by Hatred. Players explore ancient ruins, swamps, and towering trees to uncover the region's secrets. Nahantu includes side quests and world events for additional exploration and rewards. The region features a day-and-night cycle, affecting enemy types and challenges.\nThe expansion serves as a continuation of the Diablo IV narrative, focusing on events subsequent to the base game. The story follows Neyrelle, a character associated with Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred. Players are tasked with tracking Neyrelle and confronting the growing influence of Hatred in the region of Nahantu. The plot is initiated by the theft of a soulstone containing the imprisoned Mephisto, leading to his malevolent power spreading through Sanctuary.\nDevelopment\nVessel of Hatred is being developed by Blizzard Team 3, the same group responsible for the base game. Development began shortly after the release of Diablo IV, with a focus on addressing player feedback and introducing substantial new content. Blizzard Entertainment previously stated that the company plans to release a new expansion for the game every year. A key goal for the development team was to create a new playable class that offered a distinct playstyle and fit seamlessly into the world of Sanctuary. The Spiritborn class was conceived as a result of this process, with abilities that complement the existing classes while providing fresh challenges and opportunities.\nThe creation of the Nahantu region presented a new set of challenges for the development team. To achieve the desired atmosphere of a dense, overgrown jungle, the team ",

    "Togolese bean-to-bar chocolate manufacturer\nChoco Togo is a Togolese bean-to-bar chocolate manufacturer. It is structured as a cooperative and produces chocolate from domestically grown cocoa beans. It was founded in 2014 by a group of Togolese entrepreneurs who had trained as chocolatiers in Italy. Most of its chocolate is sold locally at affordable prices, but a few sales have been made to international buyers. Chocolate bars produced by Choco Togo are unique in that they are heat resistant, able to withstand temperatures of up to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F).\nFounding\nChoco Togo was established as part of an international project started by the European Union in 2013. The project, titled \"Fair, Young, Sustainable, Inclusive, and Cooperative\", aimed to \"promote cooperative and inclusive thinking\" among youth in Togo. Sixty Togolese youths were trained in entrepreneurial practices and cooperative living by the Enfant-Food-D\u00e9veloppement association, with the support of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Czech Republic, and Italy, the sponsor country. Six individuals from the larger group were then selected to travel to Sicily, Italy, for further training in chocolate making. During their time in Sicily, the trainees received instruction in cocoa processing, fair trade, tourism, and e-commerce. Upon returning to Togo, the trainees learned that domestic cocoa processing had not been attempted in the country since the colonial era, and most Togolese cocoa farmers did not know about chocolate. The trainees therefore decided to create a brand of \"Made in Togo\" chocolate and founded the Choco Togo cooperative in March 2014.\nOperations\nAt the beginning, Choco Togo was funded solely by its founders. The cooperative lacked the high-performance machines used in Sicily to produce high quality chocolate, and resorted to working with unsuitable equipment. However, these financial and equipment issues were alleviated in 2015, when Choco Togo won a number of entrepreneurial and agricultural awards which included millions of West African francs in prize money. Later that same year, the cooperative held the first chocolate fair in Togo, and received an order for 4,000 chocolate bars from Togo's Ministry of Posts and Digital Economy.\nTo source high-quality cocoa, Choco Togo tasked the Federation of Unions of Coffee-Cocoa Producers with identifying a domestic cocoa producer with organic certification. A producer representing 1,500 smallhold farmers in Ak\u00e9bou Prefecture was selected. Once harvested, the cocoa is transported to Kpalim\u00e9, Ak\u00e9bou Prefecture, where forty local women perform the initial processing, which includes sorting, roasting, shelling, and grinding. The resulting powder is then sent to Lom\u00e9, where it is refined into chocolate paste. The paste is tempered and molded into chocolate bars, most of which are sold locally at affordable prices. However, Choco Togo also sells chocolate to Asky Airlines and at one point exported 2.2 tonnes of cocoa beans to Japan.\nCommunity projects\nChoco Togo runs a community development project called Chocoland, which uses the cooperative's mutual savings and microcredits to fund the development of a cocoa farming community in Danyigan, a village in southwest Togo. In 2018, the cooperative expressed its goal of building a health center in the village to reduce the local maternal and infant mortality rates.\nOrganisation\nChoco Togo is a member of the Association of Coffee-Cocoa Processors in Togo, which is part of the Interprofessional Council of the Coffee-Cocoa Subsidiary. This council includes producers, exporters, buyers, and consumers.\nProducts\nChoco Togo's chocolate bars have a rough texture that makes them heat resistant. They can withstand temperatures of up to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F), allowing them to be sold by market stallholders in the tropical climate of Togo, which has a temperature range of 22 to 32\u00a0\u00b0C (72 to 90\u00a0\u00b0F). In 2016, the price of an 80-gram (2.8\u00a0oz) bar was 1,000 West African francs, or about 1.5 euros. Aside from chocolate bars, the cooperative also sells various derivative products, such as hot chocolate, chocolate cake, and other confectionaries. Choco Togo's chocolate is fair trade certified.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k Agbokou, Eric (10 November 2018). \"Eric Agbokou de Choco Togo\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0S'approprier le march\u00e9 ouest-africain du chocolat et rendre sa fiert\u00e9 au producteur local\u00a0\u00bb\" .

    "First full-time secretary hired for a Major League Baseball player\nCarla Koplin Cohn (born January 17, 1947) is an American former secretary who served as the personal secretary to Henry Aaron, Hall of Fame baseball player and one of the greatest players in baseball history, during his chase of Babe Ruth's home run record of 714. She was the first full-time secretary ever written into the contract of a Major League Baseball player.\nEarly life and education\nKoplin was born in 1947 to a Jewish family in Macon, Georgia. Her parents were Nora (n\u00e9e Coolik) and Alvin Koplin. She graduated from Miller High School for Girls and then attended the University of Georgia for two years, after which she enrolled in a secretarial school in New York City.\nCareer\nAfter finishing school, Koplin applied for a position with the Atlanta Braves in 1969. Dick Cecil, Vice President of the Braves, hired her to work as the assistant of the director of a new youth summer camp. She worked in an office situated in the tunnel leading to the Braves' clubhouse, which was how she met Aaron.\nWhen Aaron hit his 600th home run and the possibility of him breaking Babe Ruth's record became inevitable, he asked Koplin to help out with his increasing mail. After a year working for both the summer camp and Aaron, with her workload becoming extraneous, he had Koplin written into his contract, making her the first full-time secretary to a baseball player.\nKoplin primary duty was to sort through Aaron's large numbers of mail; in 1973, he received approximately 900,000 letters. She organized the mail into congratulatory notes, and another pile for fans who sent baseball cards for Aaron to autograph. She sorted out hate mail and death threats, the latter of which she would report to the FBI. Koplin herself received death threats as well: \"They knew I was white, Jewish, and working for a Black man.\" Additionally, she also scheduled his personal appearances and handled his business correspondence.\nKoplin was present in the ballpark when Aaron hit his 715th career home run, passing Babe Ruth. Later on, when Aaron went to the Milwaukee Brewers, Koplin moved there with him and continued to work in the same position as she did with the Braves until Aaron's retirement. She then moved to New York City and eventually Westport, Connecticut.\nPersonal life\nKoplin married Al Cohn and had one child with her, a daughter named Jennifer, through whom she has a grandchild. Widowed in 2007, she retired to Boca Raton, Florida in 2009. Her daughter called Aaron \"Uncle Henry\".\nShe and Aaron remained close for the rest of his life. Aaron attended her wedding and also spoke at her daughter's wedding. Cohn attended all of Aaron's major events. When Aaron died in 2021, she was one of the few people allowed to attend his private funeral, gatherings at the time having been restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Grisamore, Ed (February 1, 2021). \"When the mail came, she was there for Hank Aaron\".

At the age of 16 she moved to Colorado where she was treated for tuberculosis, returning to St. Louis until she moved to Mobile, Alabama to live with relatives. In 1912 she married her first cousin (Reece Bernheimer or Maurice Lowenstein depending on the source. \nMilner refers to her first husband only as \"Reese\" in her autobiography.) He died the same year.\nMilner moved to New York where she attended the New York School of Philanthropy (now the Columbia University School of Social Work), and the Rand School of Social Science. She returned to St. Louis after graduation. There she met Roger Nash Baldwin, who she worked with at the St. Louis, Civic League. She became active in the cause of women's suffrage, joining the Equal Suffrage League of St. Louis and attending the National American Woman Suffrage Association.\nReturning to New York, Milner was active in the National Civil Liberties Bureau advocating for the rights of conscientious objectors to military service. She would go on to serve as the executive secretary of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) when it was formed in 1920. The same year she married Joseph Milner with whom she had two children.\nMilner had a long association with the ACLU. Her relationship grew strained in the 1930s when the ACLU began removing members of the organization who were known members of the Communist party. Specifically, the ACLU forced the resignation of Harry F. Ward and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. Milner quit the organization in to protest the ACLU's advocacy for the rights of American fascist groups in the 1940s.\nIn 1954 she wrote an autobiography entitled The Education of an American Liberal.\nShe died on August 14, 1975, in New York City.\nReferences\n^ \"Lucille Bernheimer\".

    "Historic building in Ebberston, North Yorkshire, England\nThe building, in 2008\nWestwood Farmhouse is a historic building in Ebberston, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe building was constructed in the mid 18th century. It was grade II* listed in 1986, on account of what Historic England describes as its \"remarkable panelled fittings\", which are particularly well preserved having never been painted. Although fully panelled rooms are rare in smaller houses of this period, features include a moulded bressumer with a shelf and cupboards on the ground floor, and a firehood on the first floor, and overmantels with cupboards on each floor.\nThe two-storey farmhouse is built of limestone, with a floor band, a moulded eaves cornice, and a pantile roof with coped gables and shaped kneelers. There are two storeys, three bays and a rear wing. The central doorway has a divided fanlight, the windows are sashes, and all the openings have lintels with tripartite keystones. Inside, original panelled doors with brass fittings survive throughout, including in the attic. The roof truss is a reused cruck pair.\nNorthwest of the house is a late-18th century, grade II-listed building, comprising a former byre with granary above, a stable, a cartshed and a loose box. The building is in sandstone with quoins and a pantile roof. It has an L-shaped plan, the byre and granary with one storey and a loft, and a single-storey range on the left. The openings include doorways, windows, slit vents and pitching windows. There is an external flight of stone steps.\nSee also\nListed buildings in Ebberston and Yedingham\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\nReferences\n^ a b Historic England. \"Westwood Farmhouse (1280313)\".

    "\n2024 single by Lisa\n\"New Woman\" is a song by Thai rapper and singer Lisa featuring Spanish singer Rosal\u00eda. It was released through Lloud and RCA Records on August 16, 2024. It is primarily a pop and electronic track with lyrics about rediscovering one's identity. The song was produced by Ilya and Max Martin and written by them alongside Lisa, Rosal\u00eda, Tove Burman, and Tove Lo.\nBackground and development\nThe collaboration of Lisa and Rosal\u00eda was described as long-coming, with the two artists having expressed their admiration for one another previously. In an interview with Radio Disney M\u00e9xico in March 2022, Rosal\u00eda described herself as a fan: \"I love Lisa. I'm a fan of hers. To me, I love her. She dances well and she is so talented.\" Similarly, in May 2022, Lisa praised her to Rolling Stone, saying that \"Rosal\u00eda is so cool. She has her own Spanish culture, that's inside her person, that influences her music.\"\nIn December 2023, Lisa declined to renew her contract with her label YG Entertainment for individual activities. She proceeded to establish her own artist management company called Lloud in February 2024. In April, she signed with RCA Records to release solo music in partnership with Lloud. She released \"Rockstar\" on June 28, her first single under Lloud and RCA Records since her departure from YG Entertainment. \"New Woman\" serves as Lisa's second single in 2024 after \"Rockstar\", and Rosal\u00eda's first single of the year following her collaborations with Rauw Alejandro on the EP RR and Bj\u00f6rk on the single \"Oral\", both released in 2023.\nComposition\nLisa, Rosal\u00eda Vila Tobella, Tove Burman, Tove Lo, Ilya and Max Martin wrote \"New Woman\", and the latter two produced the track. Tove Lo is also credited as a background vocalist. \"New Woman\" is a \"Y2K-inspired\" pop and electronic song that runs for 3 minutes. It starts with Lisa singing  about \"walking through fire to rediscover shes is a 'New Woman' with a 'revved up aura'\". The singer also \"talks of blooming like a flower, walking through the fire, taking her time and rediscovering herself\". After the first chorus, the rhythm of \"New Woman\"  \"slows down\" and is followed by  Rosal\u00eda's Spanish verse with \"whispered\" lyrics.\nRobin Murray of Clash described the track as a \"a real statement of feminine pop energy\". Stereogum's Danielle Chelosky called it a \"summery banger\" that features \"a killer beat change\". Janice Sim from Singapore Vogue described it as a \"sinuous, groovy track\" that features \"Lisa's unravelling of a new self\".\nRelease and promotion\nOn August 2, Lisa began teasing a follow-up release to \"Rockstar\" by sharing a snippet on social media, which featured her in pink hair showing off a star-shaped pendant around her neck. Three days later, Lloud posted a second teaser with the same audio showing a titled silver star in front of a pink cloudy sky with the words \"coming soon\" scrolling across it, followed by a rotating silvery rose, and finally the text \"LALISA ______.\" The blank space as well as the rose led fans to speculate that the song would be a collaboration with Spanish singer Rosal\u00eda. The two artists officially announced the single on August 6, revealing its title \"New Woman\" and its release date of August 15 at 8 p.m. ET, or August 16 at 7 a.m. ICT. The announcement was accompanied by the single's cover art, which depicts Lisa and Rosal\u00eda staring sensually at the camera in their sunglasses, the former in a leather corset and jacket and the latter in a furry pink coat. The day of the song's release, Lisa appeared as the first guest on the third season of Lee Young-ji's talk show Not Much Prepared on YouTube.\nMusic video\nAn accompanying music video for \"New Woman\" was uploaded to Lloud's YouTube channel simultaneously with the single's release. The video was directed by Dave Meyers and filmed in Los Angeles.\nCredits and personnel\nAdapted from the credits on Tidal\nLisa \u2013 vocals, songwriting\nRosal\u00eda \u2013 vocals, songwriting\nMax Martin \u2013 songwriting, production, programming, bass, drums, keyboards\nIlya \u2013 songwriting, production, programming, bass, drums, keyboards, background vocals\nTove Lo \u2013 songwriting, background vocals\nTove Burman \u2013 songwriting, background vocals\nDoris Sandberg \u2013 background vocals\nSam Holland \u2013 engineering\nAnthony Vilchis \u2013 engineering assistance\nBryce Bordone \u2013 engineering assistance\nTrey Station \u2013 engineering assistance\nZach Perayra \u2013 engineering assistance\nDavid Rodriguez \u2013 vocal engineering\nJelli Dorman \u2013 vocal engineering\nKuk Harrell \u2013 vocal production\nSerban Ghenea \u2013 mix engineering\nManny Marroquin \u2013 mix engineering\nRyan Smith \u2013 mastering\nCharts\nRelease history\nReferences\n^ a b Spanos, Brittany (August 15, 2024). \"Lisa and Rosal\u00eda Rev Up Their Aura on New Single 'New Woman'\".

    "\nChurch in Ca\u00f1ar, Ecuador\nThe Santuario Eucar\u00edstico Nacional de Ca\u00f1ar, previously Santuario Cat\u00f3lico Eucar\u00edstico Diocesano San Antonio is a Catholic Christian temple, located west of the city of Ca\u00f1ar, in the Province of Ca\u00f1ar, Ecuador.\nHistory\nThe history of the Sanctuary dates back to the Eucharistic miracle that occurred on June 24, 1958, when after the onslaught of the bubonic plague in the canton, in 1934, the year that marked the construction of the chapel, it was presented during a mass in which the faithful claimed to have witnessed the appearance of the face of Jesus in the holy monstrance, when they began to notice a strange event on the sacred form exposed in the monstrance a black spot appeared, then the image of the Lord in the Host was clearly distinguished; the same vision was experienced by several people who were in the small chapel, one of them went out to the square and shouted \"miracle! miracle!\" He communicated to the faithful and curious people who were in that place.\nAnd the whole group of people also contemplated the vision, some without warning and others warned by their companions.\nThis fact gave rise to a unique event that marked not only the canton, but the entire nation, which called the attention of the national clergy to the miracle, which the parents of that time received the visit of the then first archbishop of Cuenca, Monsignor Manuel de Jes\u00fas Serrano Abad to verify the fact, which was recognized by the Holy See, at that time already being recognized by Pope John XXIII.\nElevation of the chapel to Sanctuary\nAfter this change of category, it will also be detailed that the parish priest and his successors will be named directors of the sanctuary, who will be in charge of the financial administration together with the pastoral council, having to present each year to the curia, that is, to the Diocese of Azogues, the respective details of the accounting managed by the priests.\nFeatures and style\nThis sanctuary is of vernacular, typical of the place, with which, with technological advances, it is intended to rescue the most intimate part of the temple so that the most traditional part that the temple represents for the locals and for tourists from the province, the country and the world is rescued.\nLocation\nIt is located 5 minutes from the street that connects to the Pan-American highway, and 40 minutes from the city of Azogues.\nReferences\n^ \"Iglesia San Antonio de las reales minas de Hatun Ca\u00f1ar\" (in Spanish).

Tornado counts are considered preliminary until final publication in the database of the National Centers for Environmental Information. On average, there are 81 confirmed tornadoes in August.\nSimilar to July, the northern states nearer the Canadian border are most favored for tornadoes in August, including the Upper Midwest, the Great Lakes, and the Northeastern states, due to the positioning of the summertime jet stream. In addition, there can also be occasional increases in the southern and eastern United States as a result of tornadoes from landfalling tropical cyclones should such occur.\nSimilar, to the previous month, activity during the beginning of the month was mainly due to the tropics as Hurricane Debby spawned 24 tornadoes. Simultaneous tornado activity also occurred in the Midwestern United States and Great Lakes region during that time.

    "\nIn 1930, the UK Government introduced a law that required every person who used a vehicle on the road to have at least third-party personal injury insurance. Today, this law is contained in the Road Traffic Act 1988 (generally referred to as the RTA 1988 as amended). Section 143 of that Act requires that motorists be insured against liability for injuries to others (including passengers) and for damage to other persons' property, resulting from use of a vehicle on a public road or in other public places.\nFormerly, an alternative to compulsory insurance existed, whereby an individual could make a specified deposit (\u00a3500,000 in 1991) and keep the sum deposited with the Accountant General of the Supreme Court. However, this option was abolished in 2019.\nIt is an offence to use a motor vehicle, or allow others to use it without insurance that satisfies the requirements of the Act. This requirement applies while any part of a vehicle (even if a greater part of it is on private land) is on the public highway. No such legislation applies on private land. However, private land to which the public have a reasonable right of access (for example, a supermarket car park during opening hours) is considered to be included within the requirements of the Act.\nPolice have the power to seize vehicles that do not appear to have necessary insurance in place. A driver caught driving without insurance for the vehicle he/she is in charge of for the purposes of driving, is liable to be prosecuted by the police and, upon conviction, will receive either a fixed penalty or magistrate's courts penalty.\nThe registration number of the vehicle shown on the insurance policy, along with other relevant information including the effective dates of cover are transmitted electronically to the UK's Motor Insurance Database (MID) which exists to help reduce incidents of uninsured driving in the territory. The Police are able to spot-check vehicles that pass within range of automated number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, that can search the MID instantly. Proof of insurance lies entirely with the issue of a Certificate of Motor Insurance, or cover note, by an Authorised Insurer which, to be valid, must have been previously 'delivered' to the insured person in accordance with the Act, and be printed in black ink on white paper.\nThe insurance certificate or cover note issued by the insurance company constitutes the only legal evidence that the policy to which the certificate relates satisfies the requirements of the relevant law applicable in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Island of Guernsey, the Island of Jersey and the Island of Alderney. The Act states that an authorised person, such as a police officer, may require a driver to produce an insurance certificate for inspection. If the driver cannot show the document immediately on request, and evidence of insurance cannot be found by other means such as the MID, then the Police are empowered to seize the vehicle instantly.\nThe immediate impounding of an apparently uninsured vehicle replaces the former method of dealing with insurance spot-checks where drivers were issued with an HORT/1 (so-called because the order was form number 1 issued by the Home Office Road Traffic dept). This 'ticket' was an order requiring that within seven days, from midnight of the date of issue, the driver concerned was to take a valid insurance certificate (and usually other driving documents as well) to a police station of the driver's choice. Failure to produce an insurance certificate was, and still is, an offence. The HORT/1 was commonly known \u2013 even by the issuing authorities when dealing with the public \u2013 as a \"Producer\". As these are seldom issued now and the MID relied upon to indicate the presence of insurance or not, it is incumbent upon the insurance industry to accurately and swiftly update the MID with current policy details and insurers that fail to do so can be penalised by their regulating body.\nVehicles kept in the UK must now be continuously insured unless a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) has been formally submitted. This requirement arose following a change in the law in June 2011 when a regulation known as Continuous Insurance Enforcement (CIE) came into force. The effect of this was that in the UK a vehicle that is not declared SORN, must have a valid insurance policy in force whether or not it is kept on public roads and whether or not it is driven.\nInsurer, and Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) / licence data, are shared by the relevant authorities including the police and this forms an integral part of the mechanism of CIE. All UK registered vehicles, including those that are exempt from VED (for example, Historic Vehicles and cars with low or zero emissions) are subject to the VED taxation application process. Part of this is a check on the vehicle's insurance. A physical receipt for the payment of VED was issued by way of a paper disc which, prior to 1 October 2014, m",

    "Indian comedian and actor (born 1966)\nEvangelisto Diogo Agnelo Fernandes (born 10 September 1966), known professionally as Ben Evangelisto, is an Indian comedian, actor, singer, and playwright known for his work in Konkani films and tiatr (theatre) productions.\nEarly life\nEvangelisto Diogo Agnelo Fernandes was born on 10 September 1966 in Margao, Goa, India. He was the son of Caetano Fernandes, a seaman from Benaulim, and Maria Purifica\u00e7a\u00f2 Goes, a homemaker from Colva. Fernandes's paternal uncle was a performer of moderate acclaim, known for his contribution in a minor capacity to the Konkani film Jivit Amchem Oxem. From a young age, Fernandes demonstrated an interest in Goan Konkani theater, known locally as tiatrs. During his childhood at the age of 9, he was a frequent spectator at the non stop dramas presented by Rosario Rodrigues, a popular figure in the Goan khell tiatr tradition. Fernandes was also influenced by the similar works of young tiatr artists from Colva, such as Rosary Ferns. Following the viewing of these performances, he would go back to his uncle's residence in Sernabatim and replicate the cants or songs from the tiatrs, with a focus on those created by Rodrigues.\nAt the age of 12, Fernandes matriculated at St. Anthony's boarding school located in Duler, Mapusa. During this period, he commenced composing his own unique tiatrs, marking the start of his career as a Konkani playwright. During his tenure as a young boarding student at St. Anthony's, Fernandes exhibited an aptitude for acting, which was initially identified by the Franciscans brothers. While studying at the institution, he crafted brief dramatic pieces in Konkani and English, with the assistance of the brothers in bringing these theatrical works to life on stage. Fernandes also received additional training in music and singing from mestre Anthony Velho. Among Fernandes's early dramatic writings was an English-language play titled Goa Today that addressed the emerging issue of drug addiction in the Goa region.\nCareer\nFernandes rose to prominence in the Konkani theater scene in the late 20th century. In 1980, his foray into acting commenced with the creation of the play Goa Today for an English theatrical production, ultimately winning in an inter-house competition by clinching the first prize. Over the following years, he continued to participate in and win fancy dress competitions in his local community. He then transitioned to acting in small Konkani tiatrs directed by local figures such as Cyril Fernandes and the Affonso Brothers. Fernandes' big break came when he was cast in a children's tiatr directed by Mini Mario, titled Adim Tum, Atam Hanv (Before You, Now I Am). After this production, he achieved his goal of performing in tiatrs directed by the popular director Rosario Rodrigues. He was cast in Rodrigues' play Hanv Kallokant Sandlim (I've Lost in Darkness) as well as several other shows directed by Rodrigues. He later began collaborating with another well-known director, Roseferns, appearing in his tiatr Beiman Tum (You Faithless One). This production ran for 60-70 shows, with Fernandes playing a comedic role as a \"spring priest\" that drew both praise and criticism from audiences. Following his work with Roseferns, he continued to act in multiple additional tiatrs directed by him over the subsequent years.\nFernandes' career has spanned multiple roles, including both acting and producing. Early in his career, he was cast by Roseferns to portray the role of a grandmother in the tiatr Xinxe (Glass). He went on to perform in a series of tiatrs directed by other popular playwrights, including three productions by Jose Rod, as well as works by C. D'Silva, John D' Silva, Rosario Rodrigues, Prem Kumar, Pascoal Rodrigues, and Mario Menezes. Fernandes has also expanded his reach beyond Goa, traveling abroad to perform tiatrs in the Gulf region, the United Kingdom, France, Portugal, and Canada. In addition to his acting work, he has penned several non-stop tiatrs, including Chondrim (Moon), Kidd (Worm), Pez (Congee), Devak Zai Zalear (If God Wills), among others. After collaborating with John D' Silva, he joined the troupe of Mario Menezes, appearing in acclaimed plays such as Mhoji Maim, Mhoji Dusman (My Mother, My Enemy) and Sangat Ami Bhurgim Konanchi? (Say, Whose Children Are We?). Fernandes has also directed and staged his own productions, including the play Kidd which was performed in London. His play Chondrim was particularly well-received, set against the backdrop of a waterfall.\nFernandes is known for his dynamic and convincing performances in a range of roles. One of his acclaimed portrayals was in the production of To Amkam Visorlo (He Forgot Us), penned by playwright Jacinto Vaz, imitating as Vaz himself. His talents were further showcased when he took on the same role in a revival of the classic work Sounsar Sudorlo by M. Boyer, directed by Anil Kumar. He convincingly embodied Vaz's character, creating a performance",
    "Vietnamese weightlifter (born 1995)\nIn this Vietnamese name, the surname is  Tr\u1ecbnh, but is often simplified to Tr\u1ecbnh in English-language text. In accordance with Vietnamese custom, this person should be referred to by the given name, Vinh (simply) or V\u0103n Vinh (politely).\nTr\u1ecbnh V\u0103n Vinh (born 17 December 1995) is a Vietnamese weightlifter. He won a silver medal at the 2018 Asian Games. He also represented Vietnam at the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nEarly life\nV\u0103n Vinh was born in 1995 in Qu\u1ebf V\u00f5 district, B\u1eafc Ninh in a farming family. He started practicing weightifting in 2008, after weightlifter coach \u0110\u00f5 \u0110\u00ecnh Du successfully convinced V\u0103n Vinh's family to let him train at the province's Training Center, as he saw V\u0103n Vinh's adaptable physique to the sport during a talent search in secondary schools throughout B\u1eafc Ninh.\nCareer\nEarly successes\nV\u0103n Vinh emerged as one of Vietnam's most promising weightlifters in the 62\u00a0kg category and was called up to the national team at the age of 20. As he began competing internationally, he won consecutive gold medals in the clean and jerk events and silver medals in the total lift at the 2016 Asian Championships. In 2017, V\u0103n Vinh won the gold medal at the 62\u00a0kg snatch event in the 2017 World Championships, with a lift of 136\u00a0kg to set a personal record. In the 2017 SEA Games in Malaysia, V\u0103n Vinh created a big surprise in the 62\u00a0kg category as he won the gold medal with a total lift of 307\u00a0kg and set the Games' record, defeating Olympics silver medalist Eko Yuli Irawan by 1\u00a0kg.\nTr\u1ecbnh V\u0103n Vinh (left, with the silver medal) on the medal podium alongside Eko Yuli Irawan and Adkhamjon Ergashev at the 2018 Asian Games\nAn year later, Eko got his revenge after he winning the gold medal at the 62kg event at the 2018 Asian Games with a total lift of 311\u00a0kg. V\u0103n Vinh won the silver medal at the second place with 12\u00a0kg less but still made history by becoming the first Vietnamese weightlifters to win a medal in this weight class.\nDoping ban\nFollowing his achievements in several major competitions, V\u0103n Vinh was in the group of athletes receiving key investment with the target to win a medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nIn November 2018, the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) travelled to Vietnam and tested doping on V\u0103n Vinh according to regulations. In February 2019, the test results announced that he tested positive for exogenous testosterone and another banned substances. As a result, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) imposed a 4-year ban from competition a fine of US$5,000 and to V\u0103n Vinh. He decided to not appeal to the decision and accepted the sanction. According to V\u0103n Vinh, the banned substances were part of the medicaments he used to treat his injury to recover on time for the National championship.\nComeback and qualification to the Olympics\nIn February 2023, V\u0103n Vinh finished his 4-year ban and returned to compete internationally. He participated in the 61 kg event in the Asian Games in China, ranked 6th after a total lift of 292\u00a0kg. In April 2024, he officially secured at spot at the 2024 Summer Olympics, after finishing in the top 10 of the 61\u00a0kg event at the 2024 IWF World Cup.\nIn August 2024, V\u0103n Vinh competed in the men's 61 kg event at the 2024 Summer Olympics held in Paris, France. He failed three attempts to lift 128 kg in the Snatch and he did not compete in the Clean & Jerk. A successful attempt in the Snatch would have placed V\u0103n Vinh in the third position after the lift.\nAchievements\nReferences\n^ a b c \"\u0110\u00f4 c\u1eed Tr\u1ecbnh V\u0103n Vinh: t\u1eeb \u00e1n c\u1ea5m b\u1ed1n n\u0103m \u0111\u1ebfn gi\u1ea5c m\u01a1 Olympic\" (in Vietnamese).

    "Prison building in Lima, Peru\nThe Chorrillos Women's Penitentiary Annex (Spanish: Establecimiento Penitenciario Anexo Mujeres de Chorrillos), formerly known as Santa M\u00f3nica Prison (Spanish: Penal Santa M\u00f3nica), is a high-security women's prison in Chorrillos, Lima, Peru.\nHistory\nThe building started operating on April 5, 1992, receiving female inmates from Cantogrande Prison\u00a0 that had been imprisoned on terrorism charges during the armed conflict. At the time of its opening, it was operated by the National Police.\nIn 1997, the prison was intervened by the National Penitentiary Institute (INPE) through Supreme Decree No. 005-96, which also reorganised the inmates' classification. A resolution published on July 17, 2006, transferred control of the prison to INPE.\nDespite the prison's capacity for 450 inmates, it suffered from overcrowding. It had a total of 1038 inmates in 2012, of which 175 were moved to Virgen de F\u00e1tima Prison on March 9 to prevent overcrowding.\nNotable inmates\nKeiko Fujimori, presidential candidate in the 2011 and 2016 elections\nNadine Heredia, First Lady of Peru from 2011 to 2016\nSusana Villar\u00e1n, former mayor of Lima\nBetssy Ch\u00e1vez, former Prime Minister of Peru\nYenifer Paredes, sister-in-law of former president Pedro Castillo\nMagaly Medina, TV presenter\nBlanca N\u00e9lida Col\u00e1n\u00a0, Attorney General of Peru\nIngrid Schwend, daughter of SS member Friedrich Schwend who was convicted for the murder of a Spaniard\nSee also\nNational Penitentiary Institute (Peru)\nSan Jorge Prison\nReferences\n^ \"Penal Santa M\u00f3nica: internas temen contagiarse de COVID-19\".

    "Swedish influence\nThe Danish cession document, 1658.\nThe Swedification of Scania refers to the process in which the former Danish province of Scania (Danish/Swedish: Sk\u00e5ne) was culturally and linguistically integrated and made into a part of the Swedish Empire, in the context of 17th century Swedish expansion within Scandinavia. Today, more than 300 years later, Scania is the southernmost part of Sweden.\nBackground\nFurther information: History of Scania\nAs part of the Treaty of Roskilde at the end of the Second Northern War, all areas in the historical region of Sk\u00e5neland were ceded by Denmark-Norway to the Swedish Empire in early 1658. For the Swedish Empire, it was important to integrate these new subjects and to make the Scanians identify with Swedish culture and language, rather than Danish. On 16 April 1658, representatives of Scania, Blekinge and Halland's nobility, citizens, clergy and peasants gathered in Malm\u00f6 to swear fealty to Charles X Gustav. The king was not present but was represented by an empty chair surrounded by Swedish soldiers.\nIn 1662, Sweden aligned taxes and regulations in Scania with other parts of Sweden. Some of the new rules were very different from previous Danish practice; for example, the lilla tullen (\"the small customs\"), which charged a tax for all goods brought into cities. Other changes required each city council to have least two Swedish-born members. At the same time, inhabitants of Scania received representation in the Riksdag, unlike other areas that had been conquered by the Swedish Empire.\nWhen Charles X Gustav landed in Helsingborg in 1658, he met Bishop Peder Winstrup from Lund on the pier, who  became a driving force for the establishment of the University of Lund as a Swedish counterweight to the University of Copenhagen. In 1666, the former was established under the name \"Regia Academia Carolina\", and its official opening ceremony took place in January 1668.\nAbout two decades after the Treaty of Roskilde, Sweden sought to more fully implement Scania, including enforcing changes to the church and local language. In 1681, local priests aligned with the Church of Sweden and court documents and ecclesiastical correspondence increasingly adopted more standard Swedish grammatical features.\nDuring the Scanian War in the late 1670s, pro-Danish Snapphane fighters aided the Danish invasion. This led to a campaign to capture, torture and execute those who would not swear allegiance to the Swedish king. The policy was effective and by 1709 when Denmark again moved to invade Scania after the Battle of Poltava local militias resisted the effort.\nWhen the Scanian War began in 1675, some 180,000 people lived in Scania. By 1718, only 132,800 were left. Some snapphane fled to Denmark; some 30,000 Scanian boys were sent to the Swedish army, many of whom were relocated to the Baltics. At the same time, Swedes were encouraged to take over Scanian farms and marry Scanian women.\nReferences\n^ Gustafsson, Harald (26 February 2008). \"Att g\u00f6ra svenskar av sk\u00e5ningar\".

    "Proposed intra-island expressway in the Philippines\nThe Iloilo\u2013Capiz\u2013Aklan Expressway (ICAEX), also known as the Panay Expressway, is a proposed 4-lane, 210-kilometre  (130\u00a0mi), full-access controlled toll expressway on the island of Panay, in the Philippines. It is composed of elevated roadways, viaducts, a tunnel, and a long-span bridge.\nThe project will traverse two cities of Passi and Roxas, and 20 municipalities across the three provinces of Aklan, Capiz, and Iloilo on Panay Island. The main entry point in Iloilo will be located in Barangay M.V. Hechanova in the municipality of Leganes, north of Iloilo City. This location is strategically chosen for its proximity to the proposed bridge approach of the Panay-Guimaras Bridge, which is part of the Panay\u2013Guimaras\u2013Negros Island Bridges Project. The expressway's exit point will be located in Malay, Aklan, which serves as the gateway to Boracay. The Boracay Bridge is also being proposed under the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH)'s Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects and may also be connected to the expressway once completed.\nThe ICAEx aims to reduce travel time between the provinces of Aklan, Capiz, and Iloilo and to eliminate congestion on existing highways by bypassing chokepoints in populated areas. It also seeks to enhance the logistics network, emergency response, and tourism in Western Visayas.\nThe project is expected to reduce the travel time between Iloilo City and Boracay to 2.5 hours, down from the current 6 to 7 hours.\nHistory\nThe Iloilo\u2013Capiz\u2013Aklan Expressway was initially unveiled as the Panay Expressway by then-President Rodrigo Duterte in his State of the Nation Address (SONA) in 2016, along with the proposed revival of Panay Railways. However, the project was never finalized.\nThe expressway was proposed again by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) in 2022. The current administration, under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has shown support for the project, advancing it as a potential future development. It is now being considered as a public-private partnership (PPP) initiative, with a feasibility study expected to be completed in 2024.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Iloilo-Capiz-Aklan Expressway (ICAEx) | Department of Public Works and Highways\".

    "\nEngelhart Commodities Trading Partners (ECTP) or Engelhart CTP is a commodities trading company founded in 2013 by BTG Pactual Group, headquartered in London. It has international coverage and is present in five countries. It was known as BTG commodities and started using the ECTP brand in 2016, after the split with the bank.\nHistory\nIn 2013, the BTG Pactual Group founded BTG Commodities, offering coverage, credit, and operations services, while limiting its physical commodity holdings. This move was contrary to the trend of major Wall Street banks withdrawing from the commodities market. BTG\u2019s initiative aimed to increase market share left by the reduced presence of other banks and establish a global and diversified physical product trading platform. Thus, BTG Commodities was founded, which would later be renamed Engelhart. Trading began in the commodities market under the leadership of Ricardo Leiman, former president of Noble Group.\nThe ECTP operates in financial trading, physical commerce, and credit restitution. It does not directly own mines, power plants, farms, warehouses, or vessels. The company experienced rapid growth, generating almost $1bn of net income between 2012 and 2016, reaching a workforce of 825 employees across 18 different countries.\nIn June 2024, ECTP acquired Trailstone Group, shifting its focus from derivatives trading to physical natural gas and electricity trading in markets globally, including Japan and the US.\nReferences\n^ \"ENGELHART CTP HOLDING (UK) LIMITED filing history - Find and update company information - GOV.UK\". find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk.

    "2024 studio album by Crack Cloud\nRed Mile is the third studio album by Canadian musical collective, Crack Cloud, released July 26, 2024, through American independent label, Jagjagwuar. The album was preceded by the singles, \"Blue Kite\" and \"The Medium\" released on May 15 and June 18. 2024, respectively.\nWhile the album's title, colloquially refers to a stretch of road in primary vocalist/songwriter and drummer, Zack Choy's hometown of Calgary, Alberta, that served as a public gathering place for fans of the city's NHL hockey team during the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, thematically, it touches on themes of existentialism, consumerism, genealogy, self-reflection and pop culture through a deconstructive lens. Recording for the album took place between Calgary and Joshua Tree, California in the Mojave Desert.\nCritical reception\nRed Mile was favourably received upon its release. Review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 80 from 6 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nWriting for SPIN,  Margaret Farrell offered a very positive review of the album, opining \"Red Mile is a disarmingly earnest exercise in philosophizing\" and further praising it as the group's \"ultimate rock odyssey\u2014a combination of epic poem-leaning lyrics with spacious, anthemic compositions that recall everyone from Gary Numan and early '80s David Bowie to Broken Social Scene\" \nMatt the Raven of Under the Radar also gives a fairly positive review, stating the album \"lays out with an offbeat synergy of melodic weirdness and unconventional dynamism\", but warns the juxtaposition \"could be an acquired taste for some\". He further implores \"But be forewarned, pressing skip is at your own risk and will result in missing out on expanding your musical palette with some terrifically playful and energetic indie rock\" and ensures \"those that do will quickly realize the crisp underbelly of gnarly guitars, keyboards, and electronics\u2014mixed with upbeat and curious rhythms while retaining the band's signature peculiarity\u2014make Red Mile worth hearing\".\nJoe Creely of The Skinny offered a more pedantically mixed review of the album, due to the group's sound shifting from their early post-punk roots into a territory with more \"pop sensibilities\" stating the album \"sounds like a 1976 punk band's third record, where raw fury ceases, replaced by flirtations with pianos and optimism\". While Creely commends the songwriting and highlights blues rock effort, Ballad of Billy for it's \"really enjoyable surly barroom energy\", he ultimately criticizes Red Mile as \"an experiment in straight-forwardness\".\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Zack Choy, Aleem Khan and Bryce Cloghesy unless otherwise specified\nPersonnel \nZack Choy \u2013 lead vocals, drums, percussion, piano, marimba, mellotron, synthesizer, organ, production, writing, composition, lyrics, processing, arrangements, additional mixing, additional engineering, video editing, string arrangements\nEmma Acs \u2013 vocals, writing (tracks 2, 7, 8)\nEve Adams \u2013 vocals\nIsabelle Anderson \u2013 vocals (uncredited), additional photography\nWill Choy \u2013 guitar, vocals, writing (track 7)\nBryce Cloghesy \u2013 guitar, acoustic guitar, synths, vocals, bass, piano, organ, synths, percussion, vocals, engineering, arrangements\nJared Drake \u2013 bass, backing vocals, writing (track 7)\nAleem Khan \u2013 piano, vocals, electric guitar, bass, novachord, organ, harmonium, mellotron, harpsichord, wurlitzer, synths, additional engineering, additional string arrangements (track 8), writing\nNat Philipps \u2013 saxophone\nAdditional musicians\nEllie Consta \u2013 violin\nSilvia Fioretti \u2013 vocals\nVictoria Hamblett \u2013 vocals\nWill Harvey \u2013 viola\nVenetia Jollands \u2013 violin\nArthur Sajas \u2013 vocals\nGamaliel Traynor \u2013 cello, string transcription\nTechnical\nCraig O'Brien \u2013 cover photography\nSpela Cedilnik \u2013 additional photography\nEric Cinnamon \u2013 additional engineering\nDaniel Fox \u2013 mixing assistant\nGreg Kalbi \u2013 mastering\nSyd Kemp \u2013 additional engineering\nAidan Pontarini \u2013 album layout, artwork, visual concept, formatting, graphic design\nDaniel Schlett \u2013 mixing\nJohn Paul Stewart \u2013 tape processing, vocals\nBeck Vogelgesang \u2013 cover model\nReferences\n^ \"Jagjaguwar::Crack Cloud\".

    "Kamboh Nawabs of Meerut were an influential family based in Meerut during the Mughal and British colonial period.\nHistory\nTomb of Abu Muhammed Khan Kamboh, the Nawab of Meerut and a minister at the court of Aurangzeb, constructed in 1688. Painting by T. C. Dibdin, c.\u20091850.\nThe Kamboh Nawabs of Meerut trace their ancestry from Shahbaz Khan Kamboh (c.\u20091529\u20131599), a prominent Punjabi Muslim noble in the court of Akbar, through Nawab Mohabbat Khan Kamboh who is credited with the construction of Mohabbat Khan Mosque in Peshawar. His son Nawab Muhammed Khan, the progenitor of the family, came to the region as Faujdar of Etawah in the 17th century. He flourished during the eras of Aurangzeb and Bahadur Shah I, and fortified Meerut in c.\u20091696. After his death in 1710, he was succeeded by Muhammed Fazel Khan and grandson Muhammed Masih Khan.\nThe family had been firmly established in the cities of Marehra, Amroha, Bareilly and Meerut in western UP by the 18th century, and was dissassociated with their kins in Punjab. It remained prominent after the decline of Mughal power well into the British colonial period, with the politics of Meerut being dominated by the Kamboh Nawabs until 1947.\nSeveral of its members played active role in the Aligarh and Pakistan Movements, including Muhammad Yamin Khan, Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk and his nephew, Ziauddin Ahmad. After the partition of British India, most of the family migrated to Pakistan.\nReferences\n^ Ameer, Sabine; Umair, Shah; Ahmad, Ameer (27 August 2023). \"Fading Legacy of Abu ka Maqbara: A Space of Resistance During the 1857 Uprising\".

    "French basketball player (born 1995)\nLa\u00ebtitia Guapo (born 25 October 1995) is a French basketball player who plays as a shooting guard.\nEarly life and career\nBorn in Clermont-Ferrand to a footballer father of Spanish origin and a basketball player mother, Guapo followed her mother's path at the La Roche-Blanche club, in the Clermont-Ferrand metropolitan area. She joined the renowned Stade Clermontois club and the CREPS of Vichy, then the INSEP.\u00a0\u00b7  Her parents were initially opposed to her leaving for Vichy in 2008, at the age of 12, before being convinced to by Isabelle Fijalkowski.\nProfessional career\nHaving limited playing time with Cavigal Nice, Guapo returned to Ligue 2 in Roannais, then to Reims and finally to Charnay where she won (after the one in 2015 with Nice) her second Ligue 2 championship.\nWith an excellent first season in LFB with Charnay (12.5 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4 assists per game, leading her team in all three categories), Guapo signed for the EuroLeague club Bourges. With 4 wins and 12 losses, Charnay was in a good position to secure survival before the season was interrupted early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor her first match in tango colors, a 74 to 62 victory against Lyon, Guapo was the top scorer with 22 points and the best rebounder (6) of her team despite losing 5 balls. In 2020, she signed for six years with Tango Bourges.\nNational 3x3 team career\nGuapo discovered 3x3 basketball in 2016 while she was at INSEP.\nAt the end of 2016, while a STAPS student at Jean Monnet University in Saint-\u00c9tienne, Guapo won the 3x3 university world title in China with Caroline H\u00e9riaud by hitting a two-point shot in overtime5. Spotted by FFBB coach Richard Billant, she was invited to a training camp in Voiron in June 20175.\nThe coach of the French teams Karim Souchu asked Guapo for the U23 Nations League final, but she had to give up, as she was primarily focused on her PE teacher profession. She only revealed herself in 2019 with two international medals and winner of the Women's Series with Mamignan Tour\u00e9 and Ana Filip.\nDue to a particular selection method, France must however play a qualifying tournament to participate in the Tokyo Olympic Games. This pre-Olympic tournament was postponed from March 2020 in India to May 2021 in Austria. In the spring of 2020, she was world number 1 in 3x3.\nIn May 2021, Guapo was a member of the 3x3 French team that qualified for the Tokyo Olympic tournament, with Hortense Limouzin, Myriam Djekoundade and Marie-\u00c8ve Paget. France then lost the bronze medal match in the tournament3. She was ranked the best player in the world for the year.\nThe following year in Antwerp, Guapo became world champion within the same team. Captaining the team, she was named best player of the competition. She also won the Alain Gilles Trophy for the best player in France.\nWhile playing five-a-side basketball for Tango Bourges, Guapo was made available to the French federation for a year to prepare for the Olympic Games in 3x3 basketball. Indeed, she could not play it permanently, as the sport was not professionalized; in France at the beginning of the 2020s, it was only possible to make a living from five-a-side basketball.\nGuapo participated in the women's 3x3 basketball tournament at the 2024 Summer Olympics, in Yann Julien's selection. Her partner, Franck S\u00e9gu\u00e9la, was a member of the French men's team in the same sport, and they organized training camps for young people together.\nPlayer profile\nIn addition to her aggressive attacking game, Guapo has exceptional physical endurance qualities for a basketball player, being able to run 10,000 meters in 35 minutes, which is an asset for three-player games.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k Collier, Eric (July 30, 2024). \"Paris 2024\u00a0: La\u00ebtitia Guapo, la dynamiteuse du basket 3 \u00d7 3 fran\u00e7ais, \u00ab\u00a0\u00e0 chaque fois, je surpasse mes limites\u00a0\u00bb\" (in French).

    "Canadian gridiron football player (born 1887)\nJohn Newton (born 1887) was a Canadian football halfback who played for three years for Toronto Varsity and four years for the Toronto Argonauts. He was a two-time Grey Cup champion, once as a player and once as an assistant coach, and was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.\nEarly life\nNewton was born in Limehouse, Ontario and moved to Sarnia when he was seven years old. He played football for the London Road High School team.\nPlaying career\nNewton played for the University of Toronto Varsity football team from 1907 to 1909. In 1908, he played in the 1908 Dominion Championship game at right half, but Varsity lost to the Hamilton Tigers.\nIn 1909, Varsity finished with a 6\u20130 record with Newton as team captain and he scored one try in the Dominion Semi-Final victory over the IRFU champion Ottawa Rough Riders. In the Dominion Championship, which was the first to be awarded the Grey Cup trophy, Varsity defeated the ORFU champion Toronto Parkdale 26\u20136 in the 1st Grey Cup.\nCoaching career\nOn August 30, 1912, Newton was named honorary coach of the Argonauts, but refused to be paid. In that season, Newton led the team to an IRFU championship and the team qualified for their second consecutive Grey Cup game. However, the Argonauts lost the 4th Grey Cup to the Hamilton Alerts. In 1913, Ross Binkley served as head coach while Newton remained in an assistant capacity.\nNewton remained with the Argonauts in 1914 where they returned as IRFU champions. The Argonauts faced his former team, Toronto Varsity, in the 6th Grey Cup, where they defeated Varsity 14\u20132.\nIn 1915, Newton coached for the Sarnia Intermediate ORFU team. After serving in the First World War, he coached the Sarnia Collegiate Institute football team from 1919 to 1920. He then moved back to coaching the Sarnia Imperials Intermediate team until 1927.\nIn 1928, Newton led the Imperials' senior entry into the ORFU, which was their first year on the circuit. In their first season in the Senior ORFU, Newton led the Imperials to the ORFU title game, but they were defeated by the Toronto Orphans 6\u20130. In 1929, Newton coached the Imperials to a 6\u20130 record and ORFU Championship, but the team was defeated by the Hamilton Tigers in the East Semi-Final. In 1930, the Imperials finished second in their division and did not qualify for the championship game. He ceded the head coach position to Milt Burt, but remained with the Imperials in other capacities.\nNewton was largely responsible for the growth of football in Sarnia which eventually led to the Imperials appearing in three Grey Cup games, winning twice. After the Imperials disbanded in 1940 near the start of World War II, Newton was the commanding officer of the Sarnia 2/26 Battery and subsequent entry into the ORFU.\nPost playing career\nNewton served in the First World War where he won the Military Cross as a member of the Canadian Field Artillery.\nNewton was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, as a builder, in November 1964. He died in Sarnia in December 1967.\nPersonal life\nNewton was married to Eleanor May Newton and they had two sons, John W. Newton and Frederick Newton.\nReferences\n^ \"150 Years of Varsity Football\". University of Toronto. September 13, 2011. Retrieved August 3, 2024.\n^ a b c d \"Maj. John Newton\". Windsor Star.

    "American football player (born 1952)\nAmerican football player\nRandy Lee Hall (born February 8, 1952) is an American former professional football player who was an defensive back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Idaho.\nBiography\nHall was born February 8, 1952, in Coulee Dam, Washington. He attended Eastmont High School in East Wenatchee, Washington.\nHall attended the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho, where he was originally offered a scholarship as a basketball player. He switched his attention to football after one year, eventually earning All-Big Sky Conference honors in 1972 and 1973 as a cornerback. Hall was also highly regarded as a baseball player, attending camp with the Kansas City Royals before calling it quits after sustaining a broken nose.\nHall missed the entire 1975 season with a foot injury.\nHall was drafted by the Baltimore Colts of the National Football League in the 1974 NFL draft, with the Colts selecting him in the 13th round, making him the 317th selection of the draft. He possessed what was regarded as excellent speed, having been timed at 9.8 seconds in the 100 yard dash and 4.6 seconds running the 40. He appeared in all 14 games in the 1974 season, playing mostly on special teams.\nHall missed the entire 1975 season due to a foot injury sustained in training camp, spending his time that year as a part-time assistant coach at Eastern Michigan. Hall returned to the Colts for the 1976 season, having been converted by the team from his college position of cornerback to free safety. He saw 13 games during that year, again spending most of his time as a member of the special teams.\nA contract was signed in May 1977 and Hall again attempted to land a spot on the Colts' roster. He missed some time with a groin injury, however, and was released by the Colts during the final pruning of the roster down to the 48-man limit ahead of the 1977 season.\nDuring his time with the Colts, Hall and his wife made their home in rural Genesee, Idaho.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f Wilt Browning (ed.), Baltimore Colts 1977 Media Guide.

    "\nMusical artist\nRio (pronounced as Ri\u00f3 and not popularly as R\u00edo; stylized as RIO) is a new wave band formed in Pueblo Libre, Lima, Per\u00fa in the 1980s and has almost 40 years of uninterrupted career. It is composed of Pocho Prieto (vocals and guitars), Cucho Galarza (bass), Chachi Galarza (guitar), the historical members, also Fred Aching (drums) and Juan Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez (keyboards).\nHistory\nThe band was formed in early 1984 in the district of Pueblo Libre, Lima. Founders Arturo \"Pocho\" Prieto and brothers Jos\u00e9 \"Chachi\" and Lucio \"Cucho\" Galarza named the group Royal International Orchest. In this early stage, the group covered English songs.\nIn 1984, they began to write their own songs in Spanish and released Son Colegialas through the record label El Virrey. Their first release was not very successful due to problems with the publishing house. Nevertheless, they opened doors in the Cono Norte, where they began to give concerts. The following year, the group released \"Televidente\", recorded at El\u00edas Ponce's studio, not at \"El Virrey,\" and added Coco Tafur on keyboards. With this song, Rio's popularity grew to the point that they were hired for various gigs in Lima and even in the provinces.\nAfter many tours, they released their third single, \"La Universidad (cosa de locos).\" The promotion of the band was greatly helped by the edition of videos that circulated in some musical programs at that time. In 1986, the group released their first album titled Lo peor de todo, presented at concerts in countries like Chile (including the show S\u00e1bado Gigante), Mexico, and Bolivia.\nIn 1988, they released their second album D\u00f3nde vamos a parar (1988), with songs like \"Todo Estaba Bien,\" \"Lo Empiezo a Odiar,\" and \"Cont\u00e9stame.\" This LP took Rio on tour across many countries in Latin America.\nTheir third production, Revoluci\u00f3n, recorded and mixed in Santiago, Chile in November and December 1989 and released in January 1990 only in cassette format, did not achieve the success of its predecessors and went almost unnoticed.

    "\nThe Nahir Galarza case was an Argentine judicial process, officially called  \"Galarza, Nahir Mariana s/homicidio doblemente agravado\", in which 19-year-old Nahir Mariana Galarza (born 11 September 1998) was convicted of murdering her 20-year-old boyfriend Fernando Pastorizzo (born 3 January 1997), at dawn 29 December 2017, in the city of Gualeguaych\u00fa, Entre R\u00edos, Argentina, where both lived. The case was widely covered by both national and international media.\nGalarza was sentenced to life imprisonment for homicide, which was aggravated by the fact that she and Pastorizzo were under a stable relationship.\nPerpetrator\nNahir Galarza was born on 11 September 1998 to Yamina Kroh and Marcelo Galarza, an officer of the provincial police. At the time of the crime, Nahir was a law student at Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n del Uruguay and played field hockey, which may have influenced in the case, turning her aggressive.\nWhen she was sixteen, there was a kidnapping report after she was missing for one day, but it was soon discovered that the kidnapping was false.\nBackground\nNahir and Fernando Gabriel Pastorizzo, born 3 January 1997, lived in Gualeguaych\u00fa, a city with a population of around 100,000 inhabitants located 25\u00a0km (15.5\u00a0mi) west of the border with Uruguay. Around 2012 they started a relationship whose nature was one of the main objects of discussion in the case. While Nahir's defenders supported the thesis that the couple only had casual sexual encounters, the prosecution upheld the version that they constituted a couple, even though they did not live together. The latter version was the one accepted by the court.  In January 2018, investigators confirmed, through text messages and some photographs of Pastorizzo and Nahir together with her family, that they travelled to Brazil in the summer of 2016, which strongly supported the couple thesis in addition to confirming that Galarza's family knew Pastorizzo, which they initially denied.\nAnother theme regarding the case was the circumstances under which the couple's relationship developed. Pieces of evidence such as text messages, Twitter posts, testimonies and others suggest that it was full of violence, fights, and temporary reconciliations. To Nahir's family, she was the one suffering violence from Pastorizzo. Her mother, Yamina Kroh, said that her defenders and prosecutors maintained opposite stances; while the former claimed that the aggressor was the victim, Pastorizzo, the latter claimed it was the accused, Nahir. However, the court dismissed that Nahir suffered physical violence from Pastorizzo. The Superior Justice Court of Entre R\u00edos asserted that \"Nahir Galarza's defense wanted to demonize the victim\". Regarding this matter there was also much commentary, with numerous opinions and declarations\u2014some from friends and family of both Nahir and Pastorizzo\u2014that were published on social media.\nCrime\nFernando Pastorizzo was murdered on 26 December 2017, at the Tom\u00e1s de Rocamora neighbourhood in Gualeguaych\u00fa, by two firearm shots. His body was found lying on the ground, beside his motorcycle, without signs of robbery. Shortly before the murder, he was driving Nahir on his motorcycle. The girl then walked about twenty blocks back to her home.\nAfter Pastorizzo's corpse was found in the morning, Nahir published a photograph of her and Pastorizzo on social media with the following description:\n5 years together, fighting, going forward and coming back, but always with the same love. I love you forever, my angel.\u2014\u200aNahir Galarza, December 2017.\nNahir acknowledged her authorship of the crime first to her parents and then to authorities. She asserted that she shot with her father's gun, a 9 mm she had taken with her, and then returned it to where she had found it without her father noticing. She also explained that she first shot him in his back and then in his chest.\nIn footage obtained by police from a private security camera, a person physically similar to Galarza is seen walking around 5:22\u00a0a.m. some six blocks away from the location of Pastorizzo's murder. According to the prosecution, this footage was pivotal in situating Galarza in the crime scene, even though her family denied that the person filmed was her.\nGalarza was prosecuted for \"bond-aggravated homicide\" and she was arrested under preventive detention, a condition under which she remained until her conviction.\nConviction\nOn 3 July 2018, Nahir Galarza was declared guilty of aggravated murder (which means her crime was considered more serious because she was in a stable relationship with the victim) and condemned to life imprisonment. Even though the court rejected aggravations for firearm usage and cheating that were proposed by the prosecution, this sentence means that Nahir would effectively have to serve at least 35 years in prison.\nTo date, she is the youngest woman in Argentina to have been sentenced to life imprisonment (she was 19 years, 7 months and 21 days old at the time). However, she is not the ",

    "2013 memorial in Rotterdam, Netherlands\nSlavery Monument\nThe Slavery Monument is a memorial commemorating the Dutch history of slavery, located in the city of Rotterdam, Netherlands. The monument was designed by Alex da Silva and is situated on Lloydkade in the Lloyd Quarter of the Delfshaven district.\nHistory\nFrom the 17th to the 19th century, weapons, pottery, and spirits were traded in the Lloyd Quarter. These goods were shipped to Africa, where they were exchanged for slaves. The Rotterdam ships then transported these slaves to Suriname and the Dutch Antilles, where they were traded for goods such as coffee and sugar, which were then shipped back to Rotterdam. In this Transatlantic slave trade, companies like Coopstad en Rochussen played a role, being the largest trading company in the Netherlands after the Middelburgsche Commercie Compagnie.\nAs of 2013, more than 80,000 descendants of slaves live in Rotterdam.\nThe Slavery Monument was unveiled on June 16, 2013. On July 1, 2015, it was exactly 150 years since slavery was abolished in the Netherlands. The nearby STC-Group college has adopted the monument.\nDesign\nThe monument is made of corten steel and thermally galvanized steel, measuring 900 centimeters in length, 450 centimeters in height, and 120 centimeters in width. The sculpture takes the form of a stylized ship, atop which figures dance towards their freedom. Of the four dancing slaves, the first is still fully chained, while the last is completely free, dancing.\nSee also\nHistory of Dutch slavery\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Wiersma, Sara (2015-06-24). \"Slavernijmonument: zwaar onderwerp, licht materiaal\".

    "Carousel in California\nExterior in 2024\nThe Seaport Village Carousel, also known as the Fair Park Looff Carousel, is a historic wooden carousel in the western wing of Seaport Village of San Diego, California. It was built by noted carver Charles I. D. Looff, who also constructed the Santa Monica Pier, in 1895. The carousel costs a small fee to ride and contains 54 animals and 2 chariots.\nHistory\nCharles I. D. Looff hand-carved the carousel in Brooklyn, New York City in 1895. It was not until 1904 when it was opened, however, when it debuted at Fair Park, in Dallas, Texas. It was not until the it was moved to Pacific Ocean Park in Santa Monica, California in 1958 when the carousel had rounding boards and scenery panels installed. These were designed in a style reminiscent of the 1930s. It moved again in 1967 to an amusement park in Spanaway, Washington, where it stayed until 1982.\nThe Perron family had bought the carousel in September 1979 in an auction and transported it to Willamette Center in Portland, Oregon in 1984. The Perrons converted all the figures on the carousel to Looff-made ones, as they had previously been made by other manufacturers. It moved to Lloyd Center in 1988. Historic Carousels, Inc. restored the carousel in 1991 to prepare it for the AmeriFlora '92 exhibition in Columbus, Ohio. It was later relocated to Burbank Town Center in Burbank, California in 1997. The carousel moved to its current location at Seaport Village in 2004. It replaced the Broadway Flying Horses Carousel, which had been at the location since 1977.\nFeatures\nThe carousel is hand-carved nearly entirely from wood. With three rows, it has a menagerie style, with assorted animals being included aside from the horses. There are 54 animals in total, with 2 chariots that can hold multiple people. Out of the 54 animals, 30 are jumping horses and 11 are standing horses. The horses' tails are made of natural horsehair. The other 13 are the menagerie animals, with the carousel containing 3 camels, 3 giraffes, 1 teddy bear, 1 dog, 1 dragon, 1 goat, 1 lion, 1 burro, and 1 elephant.

    "\nFranjo Ledi\u0107 (Croatian pronunciation: ; 12 March 1892 \u2013 26 September 1981) was a Yugoslav expressionist film director, producer and screenwriter from Derventa, one of the first notable Croatian film authors and self-proclaimed \"first Yugoslav film director\". He is best known for founding \"Ocean-film\" (later known as Jadran film), the first film studio in Croatia, and attempting to build the \"Yugoslav Hollywood\" in Zagreb in the 1920s. He published the first Croatian book and journal about film.\nLedi\u0107 also received attention as a Croatian mythologist, authoring a total of three popular self-published works on Slavic paganism. These works were later highly criticized by Croatian ethnologists, who judged Ledi\u0107's reconstructions of the 'Croatian pantheon' to be \"romanticized\", \"uncritical\" and \"arbitrary\", pointing also to a lack of verifiable sources in his works.\nBiography\nEarly life and Berlin\nLedi\u0107 was born in Derventa, Austria-Hungary, in 1892. He graduated from a public school and travelled across Europe between the years 1907 and 1910. In 1911 he settled in Berlin, and started to work various jobs in Oskar Messter's productions from 1912: an extra, set designer, make-up artist, assistant camera operator etc. During his stay in Berlin, after shooting several short films in the late 1910s, he screenwrote and acted as assistant director for Ernst Lubitsch's Sumurun and Anna Boleyn, co-directed, produced and screenwrote Angelo, Das Mysterium des Schlosses Drachenegg (\"Angelo: The Mystery of Dragontown\") with Robert Leffler, and directed his first successful movie, Cornelie Arendt. After this, he founded the first iteration of his movie company Ocean-film in Berlin, which got him praise from the journals Film-Kurier (\"Film Courier\") and Zentralblatt f\u00fcr die Filmindustrie (\"Central Paper for the Film Industry\"). The journals described Ledi\u0107 as a \"Turk\" and orientalist whose goal it was to export German film to the Middle East and the Balkan region.\nAngelo\nAngelo was a 70-minute long movie in six acts authored after Ledi\u0107's synonymous novel, and the first movie produced by Ocean-film. The film was in production for two years before its premiere. In November 1919, it went on to be aggressively marketed and widely reported on in German newspapers, several months ahead of the Berlin premiere, which coincided with the showing of The Cabinet of Dr. Calligari. In December, one month prior to the screening, advertisements announced the cast, with Leffler as director (though this would be left out in the 1921 Croatian premiere) and starring Lina Salten and Ernst Dernburg. The movie premiered on 13 February 1920 and by then, advertising and reports about the movie had already slowed down significantly, most likely due to a lack of funds. The movie ultimately received mixed reviews by critics, but still got successful showings in other countries, such as the US, Czechia, Italy and a few more. For a showing held one year after the premiere, the title had been changed to Schreckensnacht auf Schloss Drachenegg (\"A Horrible Night at Castle Dragontown\").\nPreserved sequences of the film were bought by the Yugoslav Film Archive in the 1960s, and are now kept at the Croatian Film Archive. To this day, the sequences were not able to be fully reconstructed, but 38 seconds of the movie and several shots have been preserved.\nReturn to Yugoslavia\nLedi\u0107 moved to Italy in 1921, where he stayed until 1925 and directed several short films. He was ultimately dissatisfied with this and once more moved, this time to Zagreb, Croatia, where he founded Ocean-film again, this time as a Yugoslav company. Ledi\u0107 then bought land on Horva\u0107anska street, where he built a film studio with the support of Oktavijan Mileti\u0107. The studio was built as a complex in the secessionist style and named the \"Yugoslav Hollywood\". Not long after, the studio was renamed to Jadran-film, and Ledi\u0107 went on to publish the first Croatian book on film (Film. Tko ho\u0107e k filmu?, \"Film. Who Wants to Work in Film?\", 1925) and the first Croatian film journal (Narodna filmska umjetnost, \"National Art of Film\", 1926), containing poems dedicated to himself and details on the shooting of his films. He began filming and advertising Ciganska krv \u2013 Dobrotvorka Balkana (\"Gypsy Blood \u2013 The Balkan Benefactor\"), which was remade into the short film Ciganin hajduk Brnja Ajvanar (1927) due to financial issues, which also forced him to sell his studio (later known as \"Vila Kiseljak\"). After another box-office failure for the company, Njih dvoje (\"The Two of Them\") by \u0110uka Berke\u0161, Ledi\u0107 was briefly imprisoned as he was unable able to pay off his debts.\nWWII and SFR Yugoslavia\nHaving been released from prison, Ledi\u0107 continued publishing his second film journal Zvono (\"The Bell\", 1926) and worked as a traveling reporter within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During the regime of the Independent State of Croatia, he worked for the Dr\u017eavni slikopisni zavod (\"State Movie Institute\", popularly known as",

    "RiverNahal Zin (in Hebrew:\u05e0\u05d7\u05dc \u05e6\u05d9\u05df Arabic: Wadi al-Fikra) is one of the largest intermittent streams in the Negev, and it is commonly seen as the border between the northern and central Negev. The stream flows from the Plain of the Winds north of the Ramon Crater, passes south and at the foot of the Ben-Gurion Institute, and continues from there. In the northern Arava, the stream is dammed by an earthen embankment, flows into the drainage systems of the Dead Sea Works, and is diverted to the northern basin of the Dead Sea. The length of the stream is about 120 kilometers, and it is the second largest intermittent stream in Israel after Nahal Paran.\nNahal Zin has several names in Arabic, a different name for each section. The first, Wadi Nafha, flows from the high Negev mountain area to the point where the wadi turns 90 degrees east (after the Nabatean city of Avdat). The second part is called Wadi Mora after Ein Mora (the bitter spring named for its brackish waters), the lowest spring in the series of springs in the wadi's gorge (after Ein Ma'arif and Ein Avdat). The third part is Wadi Fukra, which flows from the canyon of Ein Avdat to the Dead Sea (the name means the poor stream, due to the scarcity of grazing food and the few acacia trees in the wadi).\nAbout 2 km north of the entrance to the Ein Avdat National Park, Nahal Zin forms a 'knee' where the stream turns at a right angle from north to east. The 'knee' was formed by ancient stream capture activity, where Nahal Zin captured the waters of an ancient and large stream that flowed before the formation of the Syrian-African Rift from the Edom Mountains westward to the Mediterranean Sea.\nOn average, about four flash floods occur annually in Nahal Zin. In 2004, a peak flow rate of 1,280 cubic meters per second was measured in the stream, the highest in Israel. In January 2010, this record was broken in Nahal Nitzana, where a flow rate of 1,420 cubic meters per second was measured. In 2007, part of the Nahal Zin channel and the erosion cliffs on both banks were declared a national park named \"Sculpture Garden\".\nThe Biblical Zin River\nAmong biblical commentators, there is a debate regarding the location of the biblical Zin River. One interpretation suggests that the Zin River was located in the area of Halutza, Shivta, and Nitzana, an area that constitutes the drainage basin of today's Zin River. There is confusion between the Zin River and the Sin River mentioned in the Book of Exodus as being \"between Elim and Sinai.\"\nThe Dam on Nahal Zin\nNaturally, the stream flows with floodwaters on average four times a year. It crosses the Negev, descends to the Arava Valley, and there splits into a giant alluvial fan that for millions of years flowed into the Sodom Salt Flat. In recent decades, Nahal Zin ends at a wide earthen dam built by the Dead Sea Works to protect the evaporation ponds from floods. Instead of flowing into the salt flat, the stream is diverted into the plant's water drainage system and redirected to the Jordan River and Nahal Arava. As a result, and due to the agricultural activity of the two settlements in the Sodom Plain, the area of the salt flat has shrunk by about 90%.\nEcological Disaster in Nahal Tzin\nWithin the boundaries of Nahal Tzin runs the Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline, a 42-inch diameter, 254-kilometer-long oil pipeline. This line was used to transport jet fuel between the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Eilat. After faults were discovered in the pipeline's casing and it did not meet the requirements of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the flow in the pipeline was stopped, and the operating company began upgrading the line. In June 2011, during the upgrade works, a backhoe hit the fuel pipeline and caused a jet fuel leak in the nature reserve. According to estimates, over one and a half million liters of fuel flowed in the Nahal Tzin streambed. The fuel pollution in the nature reserve threatened important springs downstream, necessitating quick action to save the reserve. The terrain did not allow immediate access to the leak area. To minimize the damage, initial actions were taken such as: manually closing valves, closing the area to hikers, building a barrier downstream to stop the fuel flow, and digging storage pits to collect the liquid fuel. The ecological consequences of the leak were severe: plants dried up and died, animals relying on these plants were harmed, and there was a serious concern that the pollution would be carried into the groundwater and the oases downstream due to the rains and floods typical of the area. Inspectors testified that even months after the incident, the stream reeked of fuel, Maariv, 22/07/2011}}}}. The Magistrate's Court convicted the EAPC company and several former senior officials in the company of severe pollution of Nahal Tzin and its surroundings following two leak incidents, in September and June.\nStream rehabilitation\nThe geology of the stream dictated the method of pollution treatment,",
    "Road in Florida, United States\nCounty Road\u00a0610 (CR\u00a0610), locally known as University Parkway, is a seven-mile-long (11\u00a0km) county route in Sarasota County and Manatee County, Florida. It is a major commuter route from U.S. Highway\u00a041 (US\u00a041) to Interstate\u00a075 (I-75) and it is the primary access road for Sarasota\u2013Bradenton International Airport.\nUniversity Parkway from US\u00a0301 west to US\u00a041 is fully within and maintained by Sarasota County. East of US\u00a0301, the route runs along the Sarasota-Manatee county line. While the route along this segment is predominately in Manatee County, Sarasota and Manatee counties have a unique interlocal agreement with the road in regards to maintenance due to its proximity to the county line. Manatee County is responsible for maintenance of the physical roadway on this segment, while Sarasota County is responsible for maintaining traffic signals and landscaping along the corridor.\nRoute description\nUniversity Parkway begins at an intersection with US\u00a041 (Tamiami Trail) on the north side of Sarasota directly across from the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art. From US\u00a041, University Parkway is a four-lane road and it passes to the south of Sarasota\u2013Bradenton International Airport. Shortly after passing the main entrance to the airport, it turns northeast and crosses the Seminole Gulf Railway before turning back east. It then expands to six lanes and comes to an intersection with US\u00a0301.\nEast of US\u00a0301, University Parkway runs east along the Sarasota\u2013Manatee county line. It immediately crosses another branch of the Seminole Gulf Railway and intersects with Lockwood Ridge Road. It passes a number of residential areas and intersects Honore Avenue before coming to an intersection with Cattlemen Road. At Cattlemen Road, it passes the Mall at University Town Center and its surrounding commercial areas before coming to a diverging diamond interchange with I-75.\nCR\u00a0610 officially terminates at I-75, though University Parkway continues east another six miles (9.7\u00a0km) through Lakewood Ranch.\nHistory\nThe route that would become University Parkway was originally a rural road from US\u00a0301 east. At the time, US\u00a0301 turned west at University Parkway and continued north to Bradenton along present-day 15th Street (301 Boulevard). US\u00a0301 north of University Parkway would not be moved to its current alignment until 1985.\nUniversity Parkway was extended east to connect with I-75 by the time the freeway opened through the area in 1981. It was designated as SR\u00a0610.\nUniversity Parkway was heavily expanded in the early 1990s. At this time, it was widened to a multi-lane divided road from US\u00a0301 to I-75. The widening was jointly funded by both Sarasota and Manatee counties. Around the same time, University Parkway was extended west as a four-lane road from US\u00a0301 southwest to Desoto Road (CR\u00a0778). Desoto Road from there west to US\u00a041 was also widened to four lanes, which then became part of University Parkway linking it to US\u00a041 and Sarasota\u2013Bradenton International Airport. The road between US\u00a0301 and Desoto Road was built on the route of a former railroad spur that once linked the two railroad lines in the area (part of the spur is still in place near US\u00a0301).\nUniversity Parkway was also extended west from I-75 to provide access to the newly-developed Lakewood Ranch by the time the first phase of that community was complete in 1995.\nIn 2017, University Parkway's interchange with I-75 was converted to a diverging diamond interchange. It was the first diverging diamond interchange in the state of Florida and it is one of the largest diverging diamond interchanges in the country.\nMajor intersections\nReferences\n^ a b Google (July 23, 2024). \"CR\u00a0610\" (Map).

    "1970 novel by Larry McMurtry\nMoving On is a 1970 American novel by Larry McMurtry. His fourth novel, it focuses on Patsy Carpenter and her husband Jim in contemporary Texas.\nLarry McMurtry called it \"a book partly about graduate school, partly about rodeo, and partly about the indecision that is likely to afflict young marrieds, particularly those who belonged to what used to be called the Silent Generation.\" He wrote \"Moving On was not the Great American Novel but for a time I thought it was. The only person to share my opinion was my new editor, Michael Korda. By the time I finished it, in 1969, I had a good deal of narrative momentum going,\" which led to him writing All My Friends Are Going to be Strangers.\nMcMurtry's first three novels had been about young people leaving the country. Moving On was the first of three novels he wrote about \"urbanites\", others including All My Friends Are Going To Be Strangers  and Terms of Endearment.\nMcMutry wanted to call the book Patsy Carpenter \"and there was ample precedent for naming it after the central character. But the publisher didn\u2019t like it, and they moved publication up to spring, and somebody suggested Moving On.\"\nReception\nKirkus wrote \"it goes on and on in a smoothly styleless, emulsified fashion.\"\nThe New York Times wrote a review which stated:\nIs atsy Carpenter worth 794 pages? Patsy is young, pretty, recently married, financially secure and psychologically adrift on a sea of qualms in the American Southwest, circa now. She reads a lot, she cries a lot, she worries a lot about her sex life. But the several years we spend with Patsy seem like just that... several years. Even in the capable hands of Larry McMurtry... Patsy seems elephantiastic. If there were anything meretricious about Moving On, any mechanized grinding out of narrative quick mix, any hard eye scouring the landscape for the main commercial chance, it wouldn't be worth reviewing. It is, however, a novel of monumental honesty, about people as real as your sister, consisting of insights as undeniable as this morning's weather. Attention must be paid. \nReferences\n^ McMurtry p 47\n^ McMurty p 77\n^ McMurtry p 73\n^ Bennett, Patrick (1980).

    "2024 studio album by Opeth\nThe Last Will and Testament (stylised as The last WILL and TESTAMENT) is the upcoming fourteenth studio album by Swedish progressive metal band Opeth, set to be released on 11 October 2024 through Reigning Phoenix Music. It will be the band's first studio album since In Cauda Venenum (2019), marking the longest gap between studio albums in their career, and its first release with drummer Waltteri V\u00e4yrynen, who in 2022 officially replaced Martin Axenrot after his departure the year before. It also marks the return, at least to some extent, of death metal elements such as death growls since Watershed (2008), as well as being their first fully conceptual album since Still Life (1999).\nConcept\nThe album is a concept album set in the post-World War I era, unfolding the story of a wealthy, conservative patriarch whose last will and testament reveals shocking family secrets. The album begins with the reading of the father's will in his mansion. Among those in attendance is a young girl, who, despite being an orphan and polio-ridden, has been raised by the family. Her presence at the will reading raises suspicions and questions among the twins. Nearly all songs on this album start with a section symbol and a number next to it in their title, except for the closing track \"A Story Never Told\".\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nOpeth\nMikael \u00c5kerfeldt \u2013 guitars, lead & backing vocals, cittra, Mellotrons, percussion & FX, string arrangments, art direction\nMart\u00edn M\u00e9ndez \u2013 bass, backing vocals\nFredrik \u00c5kesson \u2013 guitars, backing vocals\nJoakim Svalberg \u2013 piano, Hammond organ, Mellotrons, Fender Rhodes & Moogs, backing vocals and FX\nWaltteri V\u00e4yrynen \u2013 drums, percussion\nAdditional Personnel\nIan Anderson \u2013 Flute (\u00a74 and \u00a77),  Spoken word (\u00a71, \u00a72, \u00a74, and \u00a77)\nJoey Tempest \u2013 Backing vocals (\u00a72)\nMia Westlund \u2013 Harp\nMirjam \u00c5kerfeldt \u2013 Spoken word (\u00a71)\nLondon Session Orchestra \u2013 strings\nDave Stewart \u2013 string arrangements\nTechnical Personnel\nStefan Boman, Joe Jones and Opeth \u2013 engineering\nStefan Boman, Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt and Opeth \u2013 mixing\nMiles Showell \u2013 mastering\nKit Cunningham \u2013 drum technician\nTravis Smith \u2013 cover art\nTerhi Ylim\u00e4inen \u2013 photography\nAmanda Martinez & Independent Kostym \u2013 clothing\nReferences\n^ \"OPETH - New Album Details Revealed\".

    "American stadium organist\nGladys Goodding (June 18, 1893 \u2013 November 18, 1963) was an American musician who served as the stadium organist at Ebbetts Field for the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1942 to 1957, when the team left Brooklyn and moved to Los Angeles.\nShe began her sports career playing organ in Madison Square Garden. In addition to the Dodgers, Goodding also performed for the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers. After the Dodgers moved, she remained in New York City and played the organ at sporting events until her death in 1963.\nEarly life and career\nGoodding was born in Macon County, Missouri to Meribah (n\u00e9e\u00a0Riley) and Joseph Goodding, the third of their four children. Her father was a businessman and amateur violinist and her mother was a piano teacher. Her parents died when she was young; she and her younger brother were then sent to St. Louis to live in an orphanage. During her time there, she fell in love with baseball.\nUpon turning 18, she moved in with her older brother in Kansas City, Missouri where she learned to sing and play the piano. Eventually, she settled in Independence, Missouri. Due to her adept skills at the piano, she mastered the fundamentals of playing the organ within two weeks and began playing at the local church. During this time she was briefly married and started a family. She began performing light opera on the Chautauqua and Lyceum entertainment circuits, where she was billed as a \"soprano-pianist\". After her divorce, she and her children moved to New York City.\nIn New York, to support her family, she became a full-time organist at Loew's Theatre, where she provided musical accompaniment for silent films. Occasionally, she also went on tour and did solo performances on the radio.\nGoodding had her breakthrough in sports in 1937 when she was hired to accompany sporting events at Madison Square Garden, with the help of Ethel Mullany, the head of the Garden's booking department. She performed for New York Rangers fans and New York Knicks fans and also playing the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" before boxing matches.\nTenure with the Brooklyn Dodgers\nIn 1942, Goodding was by the Brooklyn Dodgers to play the organ at Ebbetts Field. Reportedly, general manager Larry MacPhail, who was an avid piano player, hired her immediately after receiving a letter from a regular attendee at the Garden. For Goodding, the Dodgers brought an electric Hammond organ and placed it \"in the baseball field 'organ loft,' a glass enclosure high above the crowd.\"\nDuring her first season, she endeared herself to Dodger fans through her trademark ingenuity. For example, when umpires Bill Stewart, Ziggy Sears, and Tom Dunn stepped on the field, to the delight of the fans, she began playing \"Three Blind Mice.\" She became a fixture at Ebbetts Field and gained wide-spread popularity in the borough of Brooklyn.\nGoodding is responsible for beginning the modern day practice of playing walk-up music. She played for both the home team and for visiting players. Other times, she would serenade players if it was their birthday.\nPersonal life\nGoodding was married to Robert Reinholdt \"Bob\" Beck with whom she had two children: Robert Jr. (1915\u20131980) and Maxine (1916\u20131988). Their marriage ended in divorce and she reverted to using her maiden name.\nGoodding died of a heart attack in New York City, aged 70.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h Edelman, Rob. \"Gladys Goodding, Ebbets Field Organ Queen\".

    "Comedian and actor (born 1964)\nAgostinho Temudo (born 17 March 1964), known professionally as Comedian Agostinho, is a comedian, actor, director, producer, screenwriter, and playwright based in London, UK. He is known for his work in Konkani films and tiatr (theatre) productions. Referred to as the \"Comedy King\", he is best known for being part of the comedy trio alongside Comedian Selvy and Comedienne Janet, for which they were awarded the Best Comedy Trio. Temudo is a former president of the Tiatr Academy of Goa, having served from September 2015 to October 2018. His plays are based on societal themes, some of which exposed corruption by the local government, police departments, and local politicians.\nEarly life\nAgostinho Temudo was born on 17 March 1964 in Navelim, Goa, India, to Camilo Antonio Temudo, a tailor, and Tereza Fernandes, a homemaker from Assolna. He was born into a Goan Catholic family and grew up among seven siblings, including Felecidade (born 1962) and Romaldo (born 1969). Growing up, Temudo had a number of responsibilities around the household. He engaged in the distribution of milk from his family's cattle to their established clientele during his daily commute to and from school. Additionally, in the afternoons, he would retrieve the vacant milk containers from these transactions.\nThe Temudo family resided in the Dongorim area of Navelim. As a child, he was described as being mischievous in nature. He enjoyed in engaging in light-hearted pranks and playful teasing with his companions, a tendency that continued even after he began his schooling. While these antics may have been seen as problematic at the time, they would later prove beneficial for Temudo. He attended Rosary High School in Navelim, where he completed his secondary education and received his Secondary School Certificate (SSC). It was during his time at this school that Temudo was afforded his first acting opportunity.\nDue to financial constraints, Temudo was unable to pursue further formal education beyond his current level of schooling. During his time as a student, he was reportedly somewhat weak in his command of the English language. However, his teachers recognized his creativity and playful nature, with his English instructor, Ms. Shalini, offering him a role in an English-language school play titled The Escaped Lunatic. On the day of the production, Temudo's performance in the play was well-received by both his teachers and peers, who lavished him with praise for his acting abilities.\nIt was noted that Temudo himself was unaware until after the completion of the play that he had been cast in the lead role, and that the success of the production was influenced by his performance and theatrical abilities. This initial foray into the school's theatrical sphere marked the beginning of his involvement in various extracurricular stage presentations and concerts hosted by the institution. He became a regular participant in these types of school-based performing arts events following his successful debut in The Escaped Lunatic.\nCareer\nTemudo caught the interest of the elder figures within his nearby community. The older boys in his village offered him the opportunity to take on a comedic role in an upcoming tiatr performance, that was scheduled as part of the village's annual feast in Navelim. It was during this tiatr production that Temudo caught the eye of Albert, another resident of the village who was known for writing folk plays (khells). During the carnival season, Temudo secured a role in one of Albert's traditional play performances. He continued to hone his acting skills by appearing in Albert's plays, titled Vonott and Baim (Well). He was later enlisted by a well-known tiatr artist named Lino Dourado. While working with Dourado in the tiatr Mauli, Temudo was approached by Jose Rod and offered a major comedic role in that production. In the Mauli tiatr, Temudo collaborated with popular comedic actors such as Comedian Domnic and Comedian Philip Pereira. His work alongside these tiatrists appeared to boost his reputation and career. In a short time, he started to receive invitations from several popular playwrights who were actively working in that era.\nIn the mid-2010s, Temudo transitioned from being one of the popular actors on the Konkani stage to becoming a popular director within the same theatrical tradition. His directorial career commenced in 2000 with the play Suseg, following his tenure as the primary comedian working with the Konkani artist Roseferns, collaborating with the latter on several tiatrs. Although transitioning to focus on directing his own tiatrs, Temudo maintained his involvement in acting. While taking a break from his directing duties, he joined the ensemble of Konkani artist Mario Menezes, simultaneously presenting his own productions during the monsoon period. The pivotal moment in Temudo's career came in 2007 when he took the significant step of forming his own theatre troupe and directi",
    "Mississippi River island in Louisiana\nUSGS quadrangle for Walls, Louisiana 1954\nPlantations and river landings of Baton Rouge Parishes of Louisiana c.\u20091884\nProfit Island, originally known as Islands No. 123 and 124, then Prophet Island, and also known as Browns Island and Isle de Iberville, is a 2,300-acre (930\u00a0ha) island of the Mississippi River in North America. The island is part of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, United States, and is located \"just off the mouth of Thompson Creek, which breaks through the Tunica Hills from the uplands of southern Mississippi and the northern Florida parishes.\" Along with Middle Ground Island, Choctaw Island, Big Island, and Island No. 8, Profit is one of the \"first-order islands\" of the Mississippi that host 2,000 acres or more of forest.\nHistory\nAccording to a Mississippi River guide published in 1859, the name Prophet Island was connected to a prophet of the Natchez people:\nThere is a tradition among the Natchez Indians, that, for years before the discovery of the \"Great Waters\" by the \"pale-faces,\" their prophet, Mah-tou-la-ki-o, was in the habit of retiring to this isolated spot for the purpose of consulting the Great Spirit, and for meditation. It is said, that after one of his most prolonged visits to this place \u2014 during which time he partook of neither food nor drink, nor indulged in sleep \u2014 he returned to his people with a sorrowful countenance, and told them that they must soon leave their homes and the graves of their fathers, and seek for hunting-grounds in a strange, far-off land. He told them he had seen troops of warriors whose hearts were of stone, whose skins were of iron, (suits of armor,) and whose arrows were thunderbolts tipped with fire. Tall, gigantic canoes, he had seen, some with wings as white and as broad as the clouds of summer, and others belching forth fire and smoke, and cleaving the waters as the arrow cleaves the air. The wondering but incredulous chiefs listened with attention to the marvellous recital of their prophet, but shook their heads when he counselled immediate, or even future removal. Full of faith in his supposed vision, and discouraged and disheartened by the refusal of his people to consider his warning, the prophet retired from the council-fires of his tribe, and betook himself again to the seclusion of his favourite island. An absence of much longer duration than had ever occurred before, led to a search for him on the island, and here his body was found, cold and lifeless, lying upon the ground, with the face downwards, and the hands outspread, as though he had died in the very attitude of prayer to the Great Spirit to avert the calamities that threatened to overwhelm them. For the accuracy of this story, we cannot vouch, but we give it to our readers as it was given to us. If true, it proves the old adage that a prophet is without honour in his own country.\nThe island is the approximate location of the steamboat Monmouth disaster that killed 300 or more Muscogee being transported to the Indian Territory by the U.S. Army. A dredging boat called Lavacca sank near the island in 1849. The same year steamer Thomas Jefferson crashed into the levee in heavy fog and sank at Lobdell's plantation near Prophet Island. There were no casualties. The ironclad USS\u00a0Essex\u00a0(1856) narrowly escaped an underwater explosive tripwire at Profit Island during the American Civil War.\nThere was a gravel quarry on Profit Island. A natural gas processing plant was built on Profit Island in the 1980s. the island has been used for grazing cattle. The island supports hunting camps. Four hunters and their dogs drowned while returning from a trip to Profit Island in December 1975.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Historic names and places on the lower Mississippi River / by Marion Bragg\".

    "Israeli writer (born 1941)\nYona Tepper (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d8\u05e4\u05e8; born 25 February 1941) is an Israeli writer.\nBiography\nTepper was born on 25 February 1941, in the kibbutz of Dafna. After her marriage she moved to the kibbutz of Yagur. She studied pedagogy and creative drama. She worked in a kindergarten, taught for many years and then became a school principal. After that she was a publisher and editor for children's and young adult literature at Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishing House for about twenty years.\nAs a writer, Tepper specializes in children's and young adult books; her bibliography includes 18 young adult books, 9 children's books and 29 picture books for children. Some of her books have been translated into Arabic, German, English, Korean and Spanish. In none of her books does she offer a solution to the problems addressed, which many children resent. She explained: \"I can neither solve the Intifada problem nor prevent emigration, nor the death of the mother who is suffering from cancer. There is no solution, that's life.\"\nTepper is married to the historian Yigal Tepper. One of her four children is archaeologist Yotam Tepper, born in 1967.\nWorks\nIn the book When are you coming back?, Tepper describes life plans, utopias and disappointments in a kibbutz based on a family history that spans three generations. Hudi left the family after military service and emigrated to the United States. Nitzan cannot imagine leaving Israel and embodies the opposing position in the younger generation. When Hudi comes to visit but makes it clear that he will not stay, a fierce confrontation of the different views ensues. Among other things, the ideals of the grandparent generation who founded the kibbutz are shaken.\nThe book David Half and Half tells the story of twelve-year-old David, who is despised by the other children in the kibbutz with the nickname \"Half-and-Half\". he alludes to the fact that although his father is Jewish, his mother Elli is a Christian from Norway who is treated as an outsider in the kibbutz. David is provoked by his classmates; but when he hits back, he is branded a troublemaker. The father asks David and Elli to be patient and hopes that the prejudices will be overcome over time. But David's mother has been suffering from a lack of appreciation for fifteen years. When the kibbutz refuses to train her as a kindergarten teacher, she wants to return to Norway. David reacts partly with violence and partly with apathy. After a heated argument, the family decides to leave together. The book sparked heated debates in Israel after its publication in 1990; among other things, it was criticized that the kibbutz was being portrayed in a bad light.\nThe picture book Who Is Passing By? is aimed at children between the ages of about three and five. In it, little Yael looks out from the balcony of her apartment and observes what is happening below. She happily observes how objects, animals and people appear and disappear from view. She tries to guess where the people are coming from and where they are going. At the end, she sees her father among the people on the street and takes a walk with him through the city. Specific questions contribute to the liveliness of the text, for example: \"Who made that noise?\"\nBibliography (selected)\nWann kommst du zur\u00fcck?, translated from Hebrew by Miriam Magall, Alibaba Verlag, Frankfurt 1992\nDavid halb und halb, translated by Iris Elkabets-Rosen, Alibaba Verlag, Frankfurt 1993\nWho Is Passing By?, translated in English by Deborah Guthman, Kane & Miller, San Diego 2010\nAwards and honors\n1995: Ze'ev Prize\n2001: Prime Minister\u2019s Prize\n2008: Admission to the Honour List of the International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY) for the book Small Stone of Love\n2008: Israel Ministry of Science and Culture Award\n2015: Devorah Omer Prize for Lifetime Achievement\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Notice de personne: Tepper, Yona\".

    "American college football season\nThe 1961 RPI Engineers football team  was an American football team that represented Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) as an independent during the 1961 college football season. In their fourth year under head coach Ed Hoffman, the Engineers compiled a 0\u20137 record, suffered four shutouts, and were outscored by a total of 168 to 24.\nThe 1961 season was part of a 43-game winless streak. The streak began on October 24, 1959, with a 16\u20130 loss to Middlebury College and ended six years later on October 23, 1965, with a 28-14 victory over Middlebury. RPI managed only a single tie (20\u201320 with Nichols College in 1964) during that span.\n\n\nThe team's leaders on offense included quarterback Dick Lundgren, fullback Rod Quirk, halfback Hank Light, and end Ron Leasman.\nThe team played its home games at '86 Field (a gift from the school's Class of 1886) in Troy, New York. Admission for home games was $1 for adults and 50 cents for children under age 14.\nSchedule\n\nReferences\n^ a b \"1961 Football Schedule\". Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

    "\n1919 baseball tournament\nBaseball was played at the Inter-Allied Games, a multi-sport tournament held in June 1919 and organized by the United States military and the YMCA. It took place in June 1919, nearly a year after the armistice brought an end to the fighting of World War I. All of the games were played at the newly constructed Stade Pershing (named after American general John J. Pershing) in Paris. \nTwo teams represented the United States and, in its international baseball debut, Canada; both teams were composed entirely of soldiers from the American and Canadian Expeditionary Force. In a best-of-four series, the United States defeated Canada three games to one.\nBackground\nBaseball was played extensively by Canadian soldiers, who were stationed on the western front as early as 1914, and later, by American soldiers, after the U.S. joined the war in 1917. With the cessation of hostilities in 1918, Unrest among soldiers awaiting repatriation caused officers to encourage baseball, in an effort to boost morale. An Anglo-American Baseball League was formed in early 1919, with games between all-star Canadian and American teams being held at Stamford Bridge and elsewhere in England.\nVenue\nTeams\nThe United States was represented by the \"Le Mans\" team, of the 86th \"Blackhawk\" Infantry Division, that had won the American Expeditionary Forces league championship (a three-game series against the Third Division team). One former major leaguer was Adam DeBus, a sergeant and former infielder that played a single season with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1917; DeBus had spent the war years at Camp Grant in Illinois, but was shipped to France after the Armistice. DeBus captained the United States team at the games. Also part of the U.S. team was William Marriott, who had played in 1917 with the Chicago Cubs and would go on to stints with the Boston Braves and Brooklyn Robins. Several other Americans had minor league experience, including Wheeler \"Moose\" Fuller, who had a long career with various Eastern League clubs.\nThe Canada national team\nThe Canadian team was also the champion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force league, selected by a series in London and reinforced by the best players from other Canadian teams. Many of these soldiers were from the \"Artillery\" team, champions of the Witley area. None of the Canadian players had major league experience, though Larry Carmel would later play with the Montreal Royals and Quebec Bulldogs of the Eastern Canada League. Three of the Canadian players (Ernest Tate, John Edis, and Paul Gilpatrick) were born in the United States, though at least two of them served in the Canadian Army.\nOne of the umpires was \"Smiling Al\" Orth, a former MLB pitcher who had traveled to Europe to care for his son, wounded in the Meuse\u2013Argonne offensive.\nRosters\n\u00a0Canada\n\n\u00a0United States\n\nSummary\nThe first two games of the series were relatively close and characterized by pitching duels between the starters. In the first game, American starter Moose Fuller kept the Canadians to a single hit over eight innings of work. Canada won the second game thanks to starter Ernest Tate, who took a no-hitter into the ninth inning before it was broken up by the U.S.'s Henning Anderson.\nAfter the June 27 game, the American team traveled to Germany for a three-game exhibition series, while the Canadians waited in Paris without playing. The wait became evident in the final two games of the series, which the U.S. won convincingly. The fourth game, played on July 6, was called after seven innings, so as not to conflict with the closing ceremonies of the games.\nThe championship trophy was presented by Hu Weide, ambassador of the Republic of China to France.\nResults\nGame 1, June 23\nGame 2, June 27\nGame 3, July 4\nGame 4, July 6\nStatistical leaders\nSee also\nBaseball in France\nTy Cobb, a Hall-of-Fame MLB player and World War I veteran who was in attendance at the Inter-Allied Games, but did not participate in the baseball tournament.\nNotes\n^ Contemporary reports refer to Fuller as having played in the majors with the Washington Senators, but this is not supported by MLB records.\nReferences\n^ Horrall, Andrew (2001). \"\"Keep-A-Fighting!

    "Japanese murderer and possible serial killer\nShigeru Yagi (Japanese: \u516b\u6728\u8302; born 1950) is a Japanese murderer, former hostess club owner and possible serial killer who is the main culprit in the Honj\u014d Insurance Murder Case (Japanese: \u672c\u5e84\u4fdd\u967a\u91d1\u6bba\u4eba\u4e8b\u4ef6).\nTogether with three female employees, he fatally poisoned two men and attempted to kill a third at his establishment in Honj\u014d between 1995 and 1999, all as part of an insurance fraud scheme. There is also speculation that he could possibly have been involved in an earlier poisoning, but he was never charged in that case.\nEarly life\nLittle is known about Yagi's personal life. Born in 1950, he began running his hostess club sometime in the early 1980s, which proved to be a very successful venture for him. At this establishment, he employed many young women, including his childhood friend Mayumi Take, who accepted his job offer after failing her high school entrance exam.\nYagi was known to be very promiscuous and frequently fraternized with his female employees, often having multiple girlfriends at once. Despite this, when his first mistress, Takako Morita, became pregnant, he accepted her offer to quit her job and officially marry him, with the couple having three children in total.\nMurders\nModus operandi\nOut of apparent greed, Yagi eventually devised a scheme to swindle older male customers out of their insurance money by arranging sham marriages with his employees, after which he would instruct the women to kill the unsuspecting victims in order to collect said insurance. In order to do this, he was aided by three accomplices: then-32-year-old Take, his 38-year-old wife Morita and 34-year-old Filipina Analie Sato Kawamura.\nCrimes\nIn June 1995, 45-year-old Shuichi Sato, a steel factory worker, resorted to drinking large quantities of alcohol to help with his sleep deprivation and to avoid overwork death. Unbeknownst to Sato, his favorite food (consisting of manj\u016b and dorayaki) was laced with small doses of monkshood over an extended period of time by Kawamura. However, when he showed no sings of weakening, Sato was fed an anpan containing a lethal dose of monkshood that killed him overnight. In order to get rid of the body, Yagi instructed Kawamura to dispose of it in the Tone River to appear as if the man had drowned. Subsequently, Kawamura was awarded 300 million yen in insurance.\nWith the insurance money, Yagi established a financial company and employed Take as his main clerk. However, whilst the company was initially successful, it experienced a rapid decline due to the economic hardship caused by the bubble economy. Because of this, Yagi started searching for new victims. On May 29, 1999, 61-year-old Akira Morita, a former employee at a pachinko parlor, was poisoned by Morita after she gave him cold medicine and alcohol laced with monkshood. His official cause of death was ruled to be purulent pleurisy and pneumonia, and weighed 40 kilograms at the time of his death. A life insurance policy totaling 170 million yen was later paid to Morita following his death.\nA day later, 47-year-old Fujimi Kawamura, a former painter who had developed a drug addiction, suddenly fell ill. He was hospitalized after complaining of his poor health and survived, but feeling that he had been intentionally poisoned, the man rushed to the nearest nurse to voice his suspicions. The nurse then informed the authorities, who stopped the cremation of Morita's body to perform an autopsy - it was then revealed that his body contained traces of cold medicine and alcohol in his internal organs and hair, and launched an investigation to determine whether this was a murder.\nMedia sensation, investigation and trial\nThe case quickly garnered the attention of the public and media alike, as the mass poisonings carried out by Masumi Hayashi had occurred just the previous year. This was bolstered by the fact that in the eight months between the story emerging and until his arrest, Yagi held 203 paid press conferences at his club, charging an entrance fee of 3,000-6,000 yen per reporter, gaining an approximate sum of 10 million yen in the process. This was considered unprecedented, and as the case grew in notoriety, the press conferences became an almost daily feature on both national television and the press. In said conferences, Yagi insisted that he was innocent, but also did a variety of other things such as chat with reporters, sing karaoke, mess around on a kickboard or show off his marksmanship skills. On one occasion, an agitated Yagi punched a reporter from The Mainichi Shimbun.\nThe investigation was initially difficult, as the only available evidence was highly circumstantial. This changed when investigators did extensive interrogations with the three hostesses, who eventually revealed that they were marrying men in sham marriages. As a result, both them and Yagi were arrested in March 2000 on charges of fraud, but a short time later, all three were indicted on murder and attempted murder charg",

    "Parish church and minor basilica in Viterbo, Italy\nSan Lorenzo in Vineis (Italian: San Lorenzo delle Vigne) is an octagonal layout,  Renaissance style, Roman Catholic church, standing alongside a closed adjacent monastery building, located off SR71, adjacent to the Cimiterio Comunale, west of the plateau comprising the historic center of Orvieto, region of Umbria, Italy. The church, degraded by time, lightning strikes, and the 2016 earthquake, is undergoing restoration starting in 2022\u20132024. A different church, San Lorenzo de Arari, is located in the city center.\nHistory\nBy 1225, Pope Gregory IX had purchased lands of a vinyard outside of the city. By 1232, a monastery of Poor Clares was established here with the support of the Bishop Ranieri of Orvieto. As was typical of many early Franciscan monasteries, it was located perilously outside of the city walls. The suffix of in Vineis refers to its location among vineyards.\nIn 1354, Orvieto, Viterbo, Narni, and nearby towns were under the Ghibelline lord Giovanni di Vico, who was frequently battling with the Papal forces. The nuns were forced to relocate inside the walls of Orvieto, likely at San Lodovico and Santa Chiara. The monastery and church of San Lorenzo were ravaged in the battles between di Vico and the papal general Giordano Orsini.\nA fresco of the Madonna and Child, painted in 1356, putatively was rediscovered in 1556 in the ruins, and this spurred veneration of the image, and thus the Commune commissioned Raffaello da Montelupo to design and build starting in 1557 the present church to house the icon and an adjacent convent, this time a male Franciscan monastery. Construction was patronized by Cardinal Girolamo Simoncelli and also by the archbishop of Santa Severina, and governor of Orvieto, Giovanni Battista Orsini. The entrance portico was flanked by corinthian columns on high plinths. The layout of the base of the church on the outside is square, but the interior and dome are octagonal. The octagonal dome structure and square layout resemble the architecture of Tempio del Santissimo Crocifisso in Todi; although that building was begun in 1588, some attribute its design to Bramante died in 1516. The Orvietan architect, Ippolito Scalza (1532 \u2013 1617) worked at both the Todi church and in the reinforcing of San Lorenzo. Finally, it has some similarities to Santa Maria Nuova in Cortona, for which construction began in 1550 with designs putatively by Vasari.\nBy 1667, the church again was in near ruins. The nobleman Monaldo Monaldeschi della Cervara commissioned another restoration, followed by another in 1765. The monastery was suppressed in the 19th-century, but the church was likely spared destruction by the allocation of the adjacent site for the civic cemetery, designed by Virginio Vespignani in 1867.\nA guide from 1883, noted the church had a main altar and four side altars; the latter included the first on the right dedicated to Sant'Antonio of Padua, the second, to San Pietro d'Alcantara, while the first on the left dedicated to the Crucifixion, while the second on the left was dedicated to St Lawrence (San Lorenzo). The main altar had the venerated 1356 Madonna and Child fresco. The 13th-century Crucifix once in the altar of the Crucifix was moved to the Museo del Opera del Duomo.\nNotes\n^ Sar\u00e0 ristrutturata la chiesa di San Lorenzo in Vineis, 04/07/2022 article in La Nazione.\n^ Finanziato il restauro chiesa S.

In 1929, it demolished a building in the same block (No.574) to erect a more modern facility, but that project never came to fruition.\nIn the Austrian-Hungarian Empire\nThe B\u00f6hmische Union-Bank was established by conversion of the former Prague branch of Vienna-based Union-Bank, itself formed recently by merger, into a stand-alone institution on 20 February 1872.:\u200a120\u200a The initial capital was 10 million Austro-Hungarian guldens.:\u200a122\u200a The BUB was soon involved into the short-lived Cr\u00e9dit foncier f\u00fcr das K\u00f6nigreich B\u00f6hmen, but that venture was wound up in 1874 following the panic of 1873.:\u200a121, 129\u200a Also in 1874, BUB acquired two other Prague-based banks founded in 1872, the B\u00f6hmischer Sparverein and B\u00f6hmische Handels-, Gewerbe- und Realit\u00e4tenbank. In 1888, it took over the operations of liquidated Reichenberger Bank in present-day Liberec. \nBy 1914, the BUB had 23 branches and branch offices in Cisleithania: 15 in the Czech lands with a concentration in the Sudetenland (present-day Bielsko, Brno, Broumov, Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 nad Labem, Fr\u00fddekJablonec nad Nisou, Krnov, Liberec, Nov\u00fd Ji\u010d\u00edn, Olomouc, Opava, Rumburk, \u0160umperk, Vrchlab\u00ed, and \u017datec), and 8 further south in Celje, Dornbirn, Graz, Klagenfurt, Leoben, Linz, Salzburg, and Villach.:\u200a165\u200a\nIn Czechoslovakia\nFollowing World War I and the collapse of Austria-Hungary, BUB had to give up its branches outside the newly formed territory of Czechoslovakia.:\u200a324-325\u200a Still, it was one of the largest financial institutions in the country, and the largest associated with the German community. In 1920, Banca Commerciale Italiana acquired a stake in BUB. That same year, BUB opened a new branch in Ostrava in the Kraus villa\u00a0, and in 1928 it acquired the small Varnsdorf Bank in Varnsdorf.:\u200a356\u200a Like other Czechoslovak banks, it was severely affected by the European banking crisis of 1931. It subsequently absorbed the Allgemeiner B\u00f6hmischer Bank-Verein which had been formed in 1921 from the former operations of Wiener Bankverein on Czechoslovak territory.:\u200a166\u200a\nIn 1937, BUB had 34 branches, mainly in the German-speaking border areas and large industrial cities with a high concentration of German-speaking population; of these, only one was in Slovakia (in Bratislava). 23 of these were lost following the Munich Agreement in 1938,:\u200a325\u200a and taken over by Deutsche Bank.:\u200a95\u200a\nWorld War II and aftermath\nIn March 1939, after the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Deutsche Bank executive Walter Pohle\u00a0 led the aryanization process under oversight by the Gestapo. The Jewish members of the supervisory board were dismissed, and the other members of the board all resigned.:\u200a124\u200a Deutsche Bank took majority control of BUB,:\u200a100\u200a simultaneously as B\u00f6hmische Escompte-Bank went to Dresdner Bank, while Deutsche's de facto subsidiary Creditanstalt-Bankverein took over the BUB's Bratislava branch.:\u200a74\u201375\u200a BUB also established an aryanization office to foster expropriation and dismissal of Jews in its client companies.:\u200a133\u200a\nDeutsche Bank planned a full absorption of BUB in 1942, but this plan was not executed.:\u200a329\u200a By 1943, Deutsche Bank owned 91 percent of BUB's equity capital, of which 33 percent indirectly through Creditanstalt-Bankverein.:\u200a170-171\u200a\nAfter the end of the war, the Czechoslovak authorities decided in August 1945 to liquidate BUB given its German associations.

    "Medication\nAfamitresgene autoleucel, sold under the brand name Tecelra is a T cell immunotherapy used for the treatment of synovial sarcoma. It is a T cell receptor (TCR) gene therapy. It is administered as a single intravenous dose.\nThe most common  adverse reactions include cytokine release syndrome, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, infections, pyrexia, constipation, dyspnea, abdominal pain, non-cardiac chest pain, decreased appetite, tachycardia, back pain, hypotension, diarrhea, and edema.\nAfamitresgene autoleucel was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2024. Afamitresgene autoleucel is the first T cell receptor (TCR) gene therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nMedical uses\nAfamitresgene autoleucel is a melanoma-associated antigen A4 (MAGE-A4)-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic synovial sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy, are HLA-A*02:01P, -A*02:02P, -A*02:03P, or -A*02:06P positive and whose tumor expresses the MAGE-A4 antigen as determined by FDA-approved or cleared companion diagnostic devices.\nAfamitresgene autoleucel is an autologous T cell immunotherapy composed of a recipient's own T cells. T cells in afamitresgene autoleucel are modified to express a T cell receptor that targets MAGE-A4, an antigen (substance that normally triggers the immune system) expressed by cancer cells in synovial sarcoma.\nAdverse effects\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescribing information includes a boxed warning for serious or fatal cytokine release syndrome, which may be severe or life-threatening.\nThe most common  adverse reactions include cytokine release syndrome, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, infections, pyrexia, constipation, dyspnea, abdominal pain, non-cardiac chest pain, decreased appetite, tachycardia, back pain, hypotension, diarrhea, and edema. The most common grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities include lymphocyte count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, white cell blood count decreased, red blood cell decreased, and platelet count decreased.\nRecipients may also exhibit immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), an immune system-related syndrome that can occur following some immunotherapies, infections, secondary malignancies, or hypersensitivity reactions, and severe cytopenia (an abnormally low level of blood cells) for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and infusion of afamitresgene autoleucel.\nHistory\nThe safety and effectiveness of afamitresgene autoleucel was evaluated in SPEARHEAD-1, cohort 1, a multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trial that enrolled HLA-A*02:01-03 and 06 allele positive participants with inoperable or metastatic synovial sarcoma who had received prior systemic therapy with either doxorubicin and/or ifosfamide and whose tumor expressed the MAGE-A4 tumor antigen. Participants received lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Fifty-two participants with synovial sarcoma were enrolled and underwent leukapheresis, eight of whom did not receive afamitresgene autoleucel due to death (n=3), loss of eligibility prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy (n=3), withdrawal by patient (n=1), and investigator decision (n=1). Forty-five participants received lymphodepletion and one patient withdrew consent before treatment, for a total of 44 participants who received a single infusion of afamitresgene autoleucel. Effectiveness was evaluated based on overall response rate and the duration of response to treatment with afamitresgene autoleucel. Among the 44 participants in the trial who received afamitresgene autoleucel, the overall response rate was 43.2% and the median duration of response was six months.\nSociety and culture\nLegal status\nAfamitresgene autoleucel was approved for medical use in the United States under the accelerated approval pathway in August 2024. The FDA granted the application for afamitresgene autoleucel regenerative medicine advanced therapy, priority review, and orphan drug designations. The FDA granted the approval of Tecelra to Adaptimmune, LLC.\nNames\nAfamitresgene autoleucel is the international nonproprietary name.\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Tecelra- afamitresgene autoleucel injection, suspension\".

    "\nNational hero of the Dominican Republic\nFrancisco Reyes Mari\u00f3n was a national hero of the Dominican Republic. He fought in the wars against Haiti, Spain, and the United States.\nLife\nA native of Sabaneta. He was a veteran of the Battle of Sabana Larga, fought on January 24, 1856, against the last Haitian invasion. During the Cibae\u00f1o Revolution against Buenaventura B\u00e1ez he fought under the orders of Matias Ramon Mella in the assault on Saman\u00e1 in 1858. He resided in Puerto Plata since long before the annexation and under that regime he was assigned to Reserves with rank of commander.\nReyes Mari\u00f3n intervened in the national war in Puerto Plata with Gregorio de Lora. He arrived with him to the Battle of Santiago. On September 6, 1863, Lora heroically died in combat and it was Reyes Marion's turn to assume immediate command of the troops that the brave martyr commanded. Returning to the Puerto Plata line, in September 1863, he was left in the canton of J\u00e1cuba, next to General Pedro Gregorio Mart\u00ednez, Juan Bonilla and Ras\u00edn Isur\u00fan. He had a close personal friendship with Mart\u00ednez and when in January 1865 he deserted and abandoned his position and came into conflict with the authority of President Gaspar Polanco, Reyes Mari\u00f3n volunteered to mediate in an attempt to achieve the return of the deserter. Before, Reyes Mari\u00f3n had already operated in Puerto Plata fields for years with generals like Juan de Jes\u00fas Salcedo and Manuel Rodr\u00edguez (El Chivo). In January 1864 he had been appointed head of the canton of Maluis; He was in the general camp of Las Jabillas, and on February 10 he was sent to exercise command at the port of Blanco, today Luper\u00f3n.

He never strayed from his vocation towards military activity, even when the overwhelming weight of the years had already fallen on him. Reyes Mari\u00f3n lived in Puerto Plata until he died in March 1908, in the midst of longing for his good times as an active soldier.\nHistoriography\nReyes Mari\u00f3n was one of the few leaders of the Independence and Restoration period to have survive until the 20th-century.

    "Roman floor mosaic\nThe Fordington mosaic, also known as the Fordington High Street mosaic, is a Roman floor mosaic from the 2nd century AD, found in Fordington, Dorchester in England, in what was once Durnovaria; it is now on display at the Dorset Museum. It depicts Oceanus, marine life, and the ocean.\nHistory\nThe Fordigton mosaic being excavated in October 1927Mosaicists Giomeria Zanetter (left) and Sidney Smith (right) with the Dorset Museum curator Captain John Edward Acland (middle), celebrating the final completion of the laying of the mosaic on 5 December 1927\nRoman history\nThe Fordington mosaic was created by the Dorchester School of Mosaicists during the 2nd century AD (previously believed to have been created during the 4th century AD); it is believed that they created this mosaic due to their specific style of theming mosaics around sea gods and marine life. It was created for a town house on the outskirts of Durnovaria (which was located near 16 High Street, Fordington) and was a pavement mosaic.\nThe town house was then likely demolished shortly after the Romans left England around 410 AD as no archaeological remains that pre-date the post-Medieval period were identified from the site of the town house.\nModern history\nThe Fordington mosaic was discovered in 1903 on the site of Lott & Walne's Fordington foundry, and it was excavated in October 1927 with the help of poet Thomas Hardy, who as a result of excavating the mosaic became ill and died shortly after. The mosaic was lifted from a pit which reached around 2 metres (6.6\u00a0ft) in depth.\nThe mosaic was subsequently donated to the museum in November 1927 by Proprietors J. J. Walne and O.C. Vidler and was installed into the floor of the Dorset Museum by Giomeria Zanetter and Sidney Smith (the completion date of the mosaic installation was 5 December 1927).\nThe mosaic stayed in the floor of the museum it was dismantled and moved onto the Atrium wall of the museum shortly before the museum reopened in May 2021; the conservation work was undertaken by Lee Kimber, Richard Ball and Brian Bentley.\nDescription\nDetail of Oceanus as depicted on the Fordington mosaicThe mosaic is incomplete, with parts of the lower section of the mosaic no longer existing today, and its design consists of a head of Oceanus, two dolphins and red-finned fish, while six red tesserae of a figure once occupying the central octagon are also present.\nIt has been described as being identical to pavement mosaics of a similar date found at Bignor and Cirencester and it also measures 715 cm \u00d7 480 cm (23.5 ft 2 in \u00d7 15.6 ft 189 in).\nReferences\n^ Cosh, Stephen R.

    "American football player\nRobert Clayton Webb is an American football offensive guard who plays for the Jacksonville State Gamecocks. Webb previously played for the Georgia Bulldogs.\nEarly years\nWebb attended Oxford High School in Oxford, Alabama, where he played football and wrestling. In his sophomore, junior, and senior years Webb was named an ASWA first-team all-state offensive player for class 6A. As a senior, Webb was named the best offensive guard in the state of Alabama and was a finalist for the AHSAA player of the year. Additionally, Webb was selected to play in the 2019 Under Armour All-America Game and was rated as the 18th best player in the USA Today Sports' Chosen 25. Webb was also rated as a consensus five-star recruit and was rated by ESPN as the number one center in the class of 2019. Webb committed to play college football for the University of Georgia over Alabama, Clemson, and Auburn.\nCollege career\nGeorgia\nComing into Georgia, Webb was regarded as an immediate contender for a starting position on the offensive line. Webb enrolled early at Georgia in January 2019 and participated in late-season practices before appearing in four games in the 2019 season. In 2020, Webb played in only three games and did not play in any games during the 2021 season. Nevertheless, Webb was a part of the Georgia team that won the national championship in 2021.\nJacksonville State\nAfter the 2021 season, Webb transferred to Jacksonville State University, where he would continue playing football. In his first season at Jacksonville State, Webb played in ten games and started seven of them, helping Jacksonville State lead the ASUN in rushing yards. Webb started twelve games the following year, helping the Gamecocks have the fifth-best rushing offense in the FBS. Following the 2023 season, Webb was named a first-team All-American and the best offensive guard in the country by College Football News and a second-team All-American by the Associated Press. Additionally, Webb was named a second-team All-CUSA player. Entering the 2024 season, Webb was touted as a highly prospective offensive lineman and one of the best-returning linemen in college football. Webb was also named to the preseason watchlist for the Lombardi Award, the Outland Trophy, the USA Today second-team All-American team, and the Walter Camp first-team All-American team.\nReferences\n^ Wiltfong, Steve (November 21, 2018). \"How wrestling molded Clay Webb into an elite football prospect\". 247 Sports.

    "\nMar\u00eda Manuela Sanz de Santamar\u00eda y Prieto de Salazar or Manuela Santamar\u00eda (Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 1740\u20131817) was a learned, polyglot, and intellectual woman from New Granada.\nShe was the most recognized intellectual in Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1, in the Viceroyalty of New Granada (today's Colombia), founder of the literary salon \"Tertulia del Buen Gusto\" during the 18th and early 19th centuries.\nNicknamed \"The wise woman of the colony,\" she was one of the most recognized figures of the time in the city of Santaf\u00e9.\nBiography\nShe was born into an aristocratic family in Santaf\u00e9, the daughter of Francisco Sanz de Santamar\u00eda, mayor of Santaf\u00e9 in 1753 and 1762, and Petronila de Prieto Salazar y Ricaurte, recognized figures of Santaf\u00e9 society. Her brother was Jos\u00e9 Sanz de Santamar\u00eda, a hero of Colombia.\nShe married Francisco Javier Gonz\u00e1lez-Manrique y Fl\u00f3rez on December 20, 1772.\nIn her home, the \"Tertulia del Buen Gusto\" was founded in 1801, contributing to the literary history of Colombia. The ideas of enlightenment, rationalism, and naturalism, which inspired the Independence generation, were discussed. These gatherings were activities to promote the exchange of ideas and healthy debate, and were social literary circles of the elite to discuss everyday, intellectual, and political topics. Political relationships, romances, and ideologies and movements were built there. Manuela's salon was open to both men and women, breaking the strict gender division in that colonial society.\nNotable figures and poets such as Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Salazar, Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Madrid, Camilo Torres, Francisco Antonio Ulloa, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Montalvo, Frutos Joaqu\u00edn and his wife Josefa Ball\u00e9n de Guzm\u00e1n, who was an active member, Miguel de Pombo, and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez, among others who would later become leaders in the independence movement, attended these gatherings. These gatherings were inspired by the Academia del Buen Gusto of the Marquesa de Sarria Josefa de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y Castro.\nThe constant participation of women in Manuela's salons reflects and evidences the transcendence of women in Colombia's independence process. Women like Josefa Antonia Baraya, Josefa Ball\u00e9n de Guzm\u00e1n, and Manuela's daughter, Tomasa Gonz\u00e1lez Manrique y Sanz de Santamar\u00eda, attended these circles and later participated in the July 20, 1810, independence movements. Josefa Ball\u00e9n and Francisca Prieto even guarded the viceroy's wife from the prison to the viceroy's palace. The women of independence wove social ties that favored the independence movement from their \"traditional\" roles as mothers, fostering spaces for discussion and debate.\n\u201cDo\u00f1a Manuela was not only a literata but also a naturalist. She had a valuable and very curious cabinet of natural history, formed and classified by herself. At night, her salon was filled with all the literati of Santa Fe, and they spent the evening engaged in literary exercises, in which Do\u00f1a Manuela and her two children, Tomasa and Jos\u00e9 Angel, who were in their early youth, took part.\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Vergara y Vergara.\nDifferent scientific, literary, and political topics were discussed at the meetings, sometimes including subjects forbidden by the Spanish crown, so they met in secret.\nShe owned one of the largest natural history libraries in the viceroyalty, visited by both locals and foreigners like Baron Alexander von Humboldt, who praised the size of her library and referred to her as a \"charming, cultured, and interesting lady.\"\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Groot, mentioning Baron Humboldt, says, \u201cHe went to visit her accompanied by some friends who had spoken much about Do\u00f1a Manuela's talent and knowledge, and she received him with all the courtesies one would expect. The conversation, of course, was about natural sciences, in which our literata shone, speaking to the Baron with ease and competence. Then she introduced him to her small natural history cabinet, where she had more opportunity to shine, discussing each of the objects she presented to the Baron.\u201d\nHer daughter Tomasa Manrique Santamar\u00eda and her cousin Francisca Prieto y Ricaurte were members of this circle. Francisca met her future husband, Camilo Torres, at one of these gatherings.\nAlong with other prominent salons of the time like *La Patri\u00f3tica* founded by Antonio Nari\u00f1o, *La Sociedad de los Sabios* circle that met at the house of Jos\u00e9 Sanz de Santamar\u00eda, or *Eutrop\u00e9lica* of Manuel del Socorro Rodr\u00edguez de la Victoria, Manuela Sanz de Santamar\u00eda's was outstanding, nicknamed *The wise woman of the colony*.\nBibliography\nLara Betancourt, Patricia. \u201cLa sala dom\u00e9stica en Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1, siglo XIX, el decorado: la sala barroca\u201d, in Historia Cr\u00edtica, Universidad de los Andes, n\u00fam. 20, julio-diciembre, 2001.\nLi\u00e9vano, Roberto. \u201cTertulias literarias en Santaf\u00e9 y en Bogot\u00e1\u201d, in Revista Cultura, vol. 5, n\u00fam. 25\u201330, Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1, enero-junio de 1918.\nMonsalve, Jos\u00e9 Dolores.

Ronald J. Yaschuk of the Telegraph-Journal wrote that the neighbourhood entered a state of decline following its closure, adding that \"the provincial government had no plan for the neighbourhood\".\nIn 2008, the Vibrant Communities and the Human Development Council reported that Waterloo Village had a poverty rate of 61.5%, a two-year increase from 56.1%. Wendy MacDermott, the coordinator of Vibrant Communities, indicated Waterloo Village being \"sort of a drive-through neighbourhood\" as potentially being part of the issue. At the time, the area was also known for having a presence of prostitution. Later that year, Waterloo Village was one of five \"priority neighbourhoods\" in the city which received funding from premier Shawn Graham.\nBetween 2021 and 2024, city officials reported an increase in calls for service to the neighbourhood, prompting Saint John Police to increase foot patrols.\nNotable people\nMain article: List of people from Saint John, New Brunswick\nReferences\n^ Perry, Brad (March 6, 2024). \"33 units planned for Saint John's Waterloo Village\".

    "Mountain in Montana, United States\nFisher Mountain is a 10,246-foot (3,123-metre) summit in Park County, Montana, United States.\nDescription\nFisher Mountain is located 3.5 miles (5.6\u00a0km) north of Cooke City, Montana, in the Beartooth Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. It is set within the New World Mining District and the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's east slope drains into headwaters of Fisher Creek which is a tributary of the Clarks Fork Yellowstone River, whereas the west slope drains into headwaters of the Stillwater River. Topographic relief is modest as the summit rises 1,750 feet (533 meters) above the Stillwater River in two miles (3.2\u00a0km). The mountain is composed of Cambrian limestone and a multiphase network of Eocene felsic porphyritic intrusions and breccia bodies. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Fisher Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F.\nSee also\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Fisher Mountain, Montana\".

    "The of\u00edcio de vaqueiro or cultura do vaqueiro (cultura sertaneja in its primitive form) is a traditional activity and culture of cattle management and care that originated in the Brazilian state of Bahia in the 16th century, requiring specific techniques for animal husbandry and having a strong cultural component, including primarily its leather clothing, leather hats, aboio, and bull catching.\nTwo vaqueiros from Bahia in leather clothing, alongside a fila brasileiro chasing a bull in the caatinga, as depicted by Prince Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied in the early 19th century (1815-1817).\nThe of\u00edcio de vaqueiro represents the sertaneja culture in its most primitive form, which originated in Bahia and spread throughout the interior of the Northeast of Brazil, becoming ingrained in the culture and forming its own identity in the region. Today, this culture is present in Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Para\u00edba, Rio Grande do Norte, Cear\u00e1, Piau\u00ed, Maranh\u00e3o, Tocantins, and northern Minas Gerais. In the 16th century in Bahia, this activity included various functions such as animal feeding, vaccination, management, and reproductive processes. Everything from the cattle was utilized, leading to the vaqueiro's leather clothing: the leather jacket used to protect the arms and torso, the leather hat to protect the head, leggings, and gloves to protect the legs and hands during work, as well as their food, including milk and meat. The meat from the sert\u00e3o gave rise to carne-seca (dried meat), first recorded in Bahia in 1610.\nVaqueiros from Bahia in the historic center of Salvador.\nThe vaqueiro and his of\u00edcio were recognized as cultural heritage of Bahia.\nHistory\nIllustrated map showing how the vaqueiro and his primitive sertaneja culture emerged in Bahia from the 16th century. The red area indicates the location where the vaqueiro's work appeared.\nLeather clothing and objects used by the vaqueiros of northeastern Brazil.\nThe of\u00edcio de vaqueiro and his cultura sertaneja (or rural sert\u00e3o culture) in its most primitive form began when the then Governor General of Brazil and Bahia, Tom\u00e9 de Souza, introduced cattle ranching in the region of the Rec\u00f4ncavo baiano, where cattle were raised freely among sugar mills. The march of cattle through the backlands began in 1550, undertaken by the d\u2019\u00c1vila with the first vaqueiros. Due to the lack of space for cattle raising in the Rec\u00f4ncavo, men and cattle had to move to the interior of Bahia. With the arrival of Garc\u00eda d'\u00c1vila's troop (a nobleman of the Casa da Torre) in the Itapororocas region in the Jacu\u00edpe basin (current region of Feira de Santana), the vaqueiro and sertaneja culture emerged in Bahia in the 16th century, with their techniques for cattle care, leather hats, leather clothing, aboio, bull catching, and carne-seca.\nVaqueiro from Feira de Santana, Bahia in 1880 by Thereza Christina Maria.\nThese men would expand following the course of rivers to the sert\u00f5es de dentro of northeastern Brazil, settling, founding several villages and farms, and establishing their culture, which over the years became increasingly rich.\nIn popular culture\nThe cultural traits of this vaqueiro profession are celebrated in various cultural manifestations in northeastern Brazil, including events and contests, music, as well as cordel literature, which values sertaneja and vaqueira culture, narrating poems and stories in booklet format.\nSome influences\nLeather hat of the encourados de Pedr\u00e3o (hat of the vaqueiros from Bahia who fought for Brazil's independence in Bahia) 1822 - 1823\nA cultural group in Serra Talhada, Pernambuco with their leather clothing of the cangaceiros (the leather clothing of the cangaceiros has its origins in the vaqueiros).\nLiteratura de cordel\nBumba meu boi in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o.\nCuisine\nCarne-seca\nThe cuisine of sertaneja culture has its roots in the vaqueiro profession, with carne-seca being one of its typical foods. For example, its first records date back to 1610 in Bahia, and it reached southern Brazil, especially the state of Rio Grande do Sul. From the combination of carne-seca and flour, pa\u00e7oca de carne-seca originated, the main dish consumed by the vaqueiros from the beginning of their formation in Bahia, to the present day throughout the Northeast and Brazil. Goat and lamb meat were other important dishes consumed by the vaqueiros, still present today.\nReferences\n^ a b Washington Queiroz.

It was established in September 2000 as a local and international joint-stock company and became the second GSM service provider in Yemen under the trade name Spacetel Yemen, which was part of Investcom LLC. In July 2006, MTN Group acquired Investcom LLC, resulting in the rebranding of Spacetel Yemen to MTN Yemen. In 2021, MTN Group announced its exit from the Yemeni market and transferred its majority shareholding to Emerald International Investment LLC, which rebranded MTN Yemen to Yemeni Omani United (YOU) in 2022.\nHistory\nAs Spacetel Yemen\nLogo of Spacetel Yemen\nThe company launched its local mobile service in February 2001, which is after the company was established by months. Before its establishment in September 2000, Spacetel Yemen paid $10 million for its 15-year 900\u00a0MHz concession in July 2000.\nAccording to the marketing manager of Spacetel at the time, the company's network covered up to 80% of the population in 2004.\nIn 2005, Spacetel Yemen signed a contract worth $20 million with Alcatel Mobile to expand and update its network.\nAs MTN Yemen\nLogo used by MTN Yemen\nAfter completing its rebranding in 2007, MTN Yemen acquired additional frequencies in the 1800\u00a0MHz band in February 2008.\nAs YOU\nAfter its rebranding to YOU in March 2022, the company began providing 4G (LTE) as part of its services. This came as 4G infrastructure was introduced to Yemen in September of that year.\nThe government in Aden contested the handover of shares from MTN Group to Emerald International Investment LLC, denouncing it as illegal and alleging that Ansar Allah (Houthis) had seized control of the company under the guise of \"foreign investors\". Consequently, a decree was issued to prohibit the company from functioning in territories under Aden's control, particularly in the city itself and the other southern governorates.\nThe company reassured its customers in the Southern governorates that their numbers, balances, and subscriptions were safe, and that it took the matter to court. On this matter, the chairman of the company, Abdullah Al Balushi, said \"If we did not believe that our legal position was correct, we would not have resorted to the judiciary. However, we are confident in the legality of the company and the soundness of its transfer procedures, and we have sufficient documentation to confirm this.\" he continued \"The procedures for the replacement and sale of shares in closed joint-stock companies in Yemen are well-known. Nevertheless, we ensured that the change was announced and that all concerned parties were notified of the new situation.\"\nThe company along with Yemen Mobile has been accused by SMEX of selling customers' active phone numbers to new ones, rendering the original owners unable to use their numbers completely.\nRebranding and ownership\nBefore its current rebranding, the company operated as MTN Yemen. After MTN Group acquired Investcom LLC for $5.5 billion in 2006, the company's name changed from Spacetel to MTN Yemen. MTN Group held a majority stake in the company from 2006 to 2021. In 2021, MTN Group exited the Yemeni market, transferring its 82.3% stake to Emerald International Investment LLC, a subsidiary of Zubair Investment Center LLC, which had previously held a minority stake in MTN Yemen.\nMTN's exit from Yemen was part of a broader strategy to withdraw from the Middle East, citing profitability concerns, since Yemen contributed only 0.3% to the group EBITDA. MTN says that it aims to focus solely on providing services in Africa.\nSee also\nTelecommunications in Yemen\nNotes\n^ with the first one being Sabafon\n^ Which is an Omani company, hence why the current name includes \"Omani\"\nReferences\n^ a b \"\u0645\u0646 \u0646\u062d\u0646\".

    "Indian escaped convict (c. 1800 \u2013 c. 1840)\nSheik Brown (/\u02c8\u0283e\u026ak/ SHAYK; c.\u20091800 \u2013 c.\u20091840), nicknamed Jack Brown or Black Jack, was a convict of Indian heritage who escaped from custody in Australia at least five times.\nOriginally from the East Indies, by 1824 he was working in England as a servant. On 7 April, he was tried at the Middlesex Gaol Delivery for \"stealing in a dwelling house, under the value of forty shillings\". Brown was sentenced to transportation for life. On 29 April 1825, he arrived at Sydney on the ship Asia.\nAnother offence in February 1826 led to Brown being transferred to the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement (now Brisbane). The settlement's commandant, strict disciplinarian Patrick Logan, was notorious for his excessive use of the lash. Over the course of Logan's leadership, around 500 convicts would ultimately abscond from the settlement.\nBrown arrived at the settlement on 2 June 1826 and escaped only five days later. He was on the run for eight days before he was captured.\nHis next escape was on 6 May 1828, and he was in the bush until 19 December \u2013 a little over six months. Around 1830 Brown made his third escape. He managed to evade authorities for two years. Brown spent time with fellow absconders and Aboriginal Australians, and lived with an Aboriginal group for some time. He surrendered in Port Macquarie on 29 August 1832.\nAfter his fourth escape attempt, he pretended to be a shipwrecked sailor from Bombay named Jose Koondiana. He was eventually identified by a fellow inmate. Brown returned to the settlement on 25 May 1834. In 1837, he absconded from 16 January to 11 April.\nThe penal settlement closed in 1842, and Brown is mentioned to have died some years before 1847.\nReferences\nCitations\n^ a b c d e f g B, Karen (2 March 2019). \"Convict Runaways \u2013 Sheik Browne\".

    "Species of insect\nStenopsyche marmorata is a species of caddisfly found in Japan. The larvae live in fast-flowing streams and are harvested by Japanese fishermen for zazamushi, a traditional dish made from a mixture of aquatic insect larvae cooked in soya sauce and sugar. This species is widely distributed in Japan, Sakhalin (Russia), the Korean Peninsula, northeastern China, and the Russian Primorsky Territory. \nlarvaThe larvae spin silk nets in streams in which animal and plant matter are trapped and upon which they feed. The larvae grow longer than 2\u00a0cm and are the largest caddisflies in the region. In the Primorsky Krai, they constitute 77% of all the trichopteran biomass and 35% of all riverine benthic biomass. The larvae live amid mussels which they use to anchor their filter nets in the Primorsky region. In Japan they are used for monitoring pollutants.\nThe family Stenopsychidae has three genera Stenopsyche McLachlan, 1866, Pseudostenopsyche D\u00f6hler, 1915, and Stenopsychodes Ulmer, 1916 and they are among the largest of net-spinning caddisflies growing to nearly 5\u00a0cm. The genus Stenopsyche has more than 90 species mainly found in the eastern Palearctic (a few in the Oriental and African region as well).\nIn the Tenryu-gawa River Community in Nagano, licenses are given out for their harvest. Zazamushi is predominantly composed of the larvae of Stenopsyche marmorata. They were originally used and eaten locally until around 1956 when they were packaged and sold as a souvenir by the company Kaneman. The aquatic silk has been a subject of study.\nReferences\n^ Shin, Hyun-Seon; Amahashi, Nozomi; Mitamura, Osamu (2013). \"Trophic position and growth stages of Caddisfly (Stenopsyche marmorata Navas) larvae in the Echi River, Japan\".

    "\nNCAA Division I men's basketball team representing Le Moyne College\nThe history of Le Moyne Dolphins men's basketball from 1960 to 1963 includes the Dolphins' championship at the 1960 Middle Eastern College Athletic Association (MECAA) Invitational Tournament and the opening of their on-campus home venue, now known as the Le Moyne Events Center.\nMECAA tournament title (1960\u20131961)\nThe 1960\u201361 Dolphins lost only one player from the previous season's starting lineup, but that player was captain Dick Lynch, among the best players in the program's history. Seniors Tommy Burns, Chuck Sammons, Frank Graziadei and Dave Rose and juniors John Caveny, Bill Stanley, Bill Ray and Joe Costello returned. Stars from the previous season's freshman team expected to contribute to the varsity squad included Mickey Flynn, Jim Downey, Chris Pitman, Bob Yahn and Mike Skinner. Practices opened on October 17, at Grant Junior High School and moved to the armory in November. Burns and Sammons were elected co-captains.\nAfter the Dolphins won their December 3 season opener, 77\u201363, at home over St. Lawrence, the Green and Gold hosted Cortland State on December 7. John Caveny had a double-double, scoring a game-high 23 points while collecting 11 rebounds, to lead Le Moyne to a 73\u201357 victory, the 22nd consecutive home triumph for the Dolphins. Caveny shot 8 for 14 from the field and compiled his numbers despite sitting out about 10 minutes of the second half in foul trouble. With the game tied at 18, Le Moyne went on a 7\u20130 run, getting points from Caveny, Tommy Burns and Chuck Sammons, who was playing through the effects of a virus, and controlled the game the rest of the way. Bill Stanley also had a double-double for the Dolphins with 11 points and 12 rebounds despite fouling out in the second half. Le Moyne shot 45% from the floor while holding the Red Dragons to a 33% success rate.\nLe Moyne's archrival, Siena, reclassified to the College Division for the 1960\u201361 season,:\u200a49\u200a and the rivalry was renewed on December 10, in Loudonville in the Middle Eastern College Athletic Association (MECAA) season opener for both clubs. Bill Stanley's double-double, scoring a game-high 15 points on 4-for-7 shooting and grabbing a team-high 13 rebounds led the Dolphins to a 49\u201345 road victory. Le Moyne had an eight-point edge at halftime and never surrendered the lead in the second half. However, the Indians pulled within one point with 1:28 to play. Stanley responded with a basket on the Dolphins' next possession. After Le Moyne got a defensive stop, Chuck Sammons hit a pair of free throws to put the game away.\nBill Stanley set a new program record, when he snared 20 rebounds in the Dolphins' 82\u201368 win at King's on December 16. Stanley also had a game-high 32 points to complete a double-double.\nUp until the 1959\u201360 season, some MECAA teams had not played full round-robin conference schedules, and others played each conference opponent with home-and-home series versus some but not all league members. The uneven scheduling created controversy about which team deserved the championship in cases where it had been decided in favor of a team that had scheduled one extra or one fewer game, since the conference title was awarded based on winning percentage against conference opponents. St. Francis (NY) had won the 1955\u201356 conference championship with a 4\u20131 record, while both Le Moyne and St. Bonaventure finished 4\u20132. In both 1959 and 1960, Saint Peter's had a conference record of 3\u20131, one-half game behind the MECAA champions each year. In part to address this perceived inequity, the MECAA staged an invitational tournament in December 1960, which was originally planned to be held annually to determine a champion with all conference teams on equal footing. The MECAA had six members at the time: Le Moyne, St. Francis (NY), Iona, King's, Saint Peter's and Siena. King's was not eligible for the 1960\u201361 regular-season MECAA championship, since the Monarchs joined the conference in June 1960, and were able to schedule only three games against MECAA members for their initial season in the league; King's did not participate in the 1960 MECAA tournament. In order to create an eight-team bracket and ensure the tournament champion would need to win three games, three other teams (Fairleigh Dickinson, Long Island and Wagner) were invited. Siena's reclassification to the College Division left the MECAA with two University Division teams (St. Francis (NY) and Iona) and four College Division teams (Le Moyne, Siena, Saint Peter's and King's).\nThe Dolphins drew host Saint Peter's in the MECAA tournament quarterfinal at the Jersey City Armory. Le Moyne entered the game 5\u20130 on the season, and the Peacocks were riding a six-game winning steak. In a game that was tight throughout, Saint Peter's took a 62\u201361 lead with 1:06 to play. A put-back of an offensive rebound by sophomore reserve Chris Pitman, who replaced Chuck Sammons after the latter fouled out early in the second half, w",
    "\"CyberJoly Drim\" is a cyberpunk short story by Polish author Antonina Liedtke\u00a0. In the story, the heroine abandons her body in favour of a digital existence. The story was first published on Liedtke's personal website in 1998. It was then published in Fenix magazine in 1999. \nThe story won the most prestigious Polish award for science fiction and fantasy stories (the Janusz A. Zajdel Award), but was negatively reviewed by several writers connected with the leading Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine, Nowa Fantastyka, which had rejected the story before it was submitted to Fenix. Critics argued that it had no literary merit and criticized those who nominated it for awards. Fans of the story praised its depiction of Internet culture, situating its criticism as a reaction to Internet culture and the story's author, who was an outsider to the closed, male world of SF literary fandom.  \nPlot\nJola (CyberJoly) is a computer graphic designer working on the Internet. She doesn't like her real life. Her husband bores her, her physical needs are unimportant. She finds fulfilment in cyberspace. There, she becomes fascinated by a person with the nickname Carramba. Longing for him, she sends a humorous letter-song to a romantic website, which unexpectedly becomes a hit on the charts. Then she creates an animation that became even more popular. She finally meets him and they get married, but her life quickly becomes mundane again. Disappointed with her life, with the help of friends she made online, Jola decides to completely cut off herself from the physical world, donating elements of her body to the bank, keeping only her mind, which is connected to the Internet.\nThemes\nGra\u017cyna Gajewska\u00a0 analyzed the story from the perspective of feminist literary criticism and the relationship between humans and technology. She focused on the heroine's marginalization of her corporeality and the simultaneous presentation of cyberspace as a space friendly to women. Similarly, in 2021, Przemys\u0142aw Czapli\u0144ski stated that the heroine's abandonment of her body in favor of an online existence \"constituted a form of rebellion against the patriarchal appropriation of the body that dominates in real life\".\nIn 2004, Wojciech Orli\u0144ski wrote positively about the story in Gazeta Wyborcza, writing that the story \"brilliantly reflects\" the problem of how for some people the \"virtual\" world is more interesting than the \"real\" one.\nAwards\nIt won the Janusz A. Zajdel Award for best short story in 2000. It also won the Srebrny Glob\u00a0 (\"Silver Globe\") award and the On-line Award by Fahrenheit magazine.\nNowa Fantastyka controversy\nBefore being published by Fenix, it was rejected by Maciej Parowski, editor-in-chief of Nowa Fantastyka, the leading Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine. After the story won prominent literary awards, Nowa Fantastyka published a section, \"Critics about CyberJoly Drim\", in the January 2001 issue. Three reviews appeared there - by Jacek Dukaj, Marek Oramus and Parowski.\nParowski wrote that \" was captivating in its linguistic and situational consistency in presenting the world of internet culture\". However, he criticized its excessive length, \"its mental monomania and action-oriented triviality\". He considered the awarding of the Zajdel Prize to the story as the result of \"promotion by a certain group\" (internet users and young authors), saying that the text met the \"mythological and sociological needs of a very large group of internet users\".\nDukaj, who himself voted for the story to receive the Silver Globe award, considers it a \"good, the best of those printed in 1999,  and important\" text, if not outstanding. According to the writer, the author successfully combined the thread of a \"banal love story\" with \"internet-related details,\" creating a realistic story in the cyberpunk genre, which he sees as \"a pioneering work in Polish SF.\" He criticized Parowski for neither understanding nor appreciating the culture of the Internet, and for \"failing to see the values in the text that most readers and writers have seen, despite being pointed out to him.\"\nOramus's response was considered the most critical. Oramus admitted that neither he nor Parowski \"feel connected to the Internet subculture from which the story originates\". He described the story as banal and devoid of literary value (\"Lietke's sentences hit the reader on the head like flails, like mauls, it is difficult to finish them in their tedious manner, because boredom is everywhere...\"); he also assessed the story as insufficiently fantastic and criticized members of the Polish fandom who voted for the story to receive awards as not having good enough taste.\nThe reviews in Nowa Fantastyka were controversial with fans. Oramus's review was criticized in depth in the fanzine Esensja\u00a0 by Konrad Wagrowski, who found it poorly argued and offensive, especially to younger science fiction fans. The April issue of Nowa Fantastyka printed six letters to the editor about \"Cr",

Due to his death in combat, he was a Martyr in the Dominican Republic.\nEarly life\nA native of Puerto Plata he was a Farmer, owner of large tracts of land on the slopes of the Isabel de Torres hill. He was a veteran of the Dominican War of Independence; He had the rank of general and was enrolled in the Reserves when the annexation was imposed.\nWar of Restoration\nHe continued to serve the Spanish even after beginning the war. The column to which Mart\u00ednez belonged was commanded by the Spanish general Rafael Primo de Rivera. It was concentrated in the San Felipe Fortress and on the October 3, 1863, he left the premises with permission from his superiors.\nHe went over to the side of the patriots and continued the fight on the outskirts of the city. Provisionally superior chief of all the cantons and finally commander of the Cafemba camp. He had two artillery pieces and with them he frequently cannonaded the Spanish boats. In January 1864, he was the Chief of Operations of the Las Jabillas camp.\nDeath\nIn the early morning of the 30th to the 31st August 1864, the Spanish launched a violent assault with a force of two thousand men about the positions of the patriots; The trench defended by Mart\u00ednez was overwhelmed by the attack of that superior force. The order came to undertake the withdrawal. \u201cAnd to whom do I leave this cannon?\u201d The brave general asked gallantly, when his comrades-in-arms advised him to retreat. He was left accompanied by only seven men and without taking a single step back, he continued fighting desperately while he had a breath of life left. He fought to the death and died in battle.

He died, says the chronicler, at the foot of the canyon and with the wick in hand. The combat took place at night, and when daylight arrived, the Spanish troops came across the lifeless body of General Benito Mart\u00ednez and, without the slightest hint of dignity and honor, they stooped to the point of attacking the corpse and burned it.\nSee also\nDominican Restoration War\nJos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndera\nReferences\n^ Mej\u00eda, Rafael Chaljub (2007).

    "\nGonzalo de Oro-Pulido Plaza (born 1970) is a Spanish politician of the party Vox. He was elected to the City Council of Barcelona in 2023.\nBiography\nDe Oro has two children, and lives in Sarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi as of 2023. Since 2012, he is a partner and director of Rhombus Global Consulting, a global wealth management consultancy. As of 2022, he had over 25 years of experience in banking, including employment at Banco Sabadell and Liberbank.\nDe Oro joined Vox in 2018 and was made their coordinator in Barcelona in 2021. In December 2022, he was named their candidate for mayor in the 2023 Barcelona City Council election. In his campaign, he said he would remove communism and Catalan separatism from the city, as well as dealing with squatting and insecurity, issues that he blamed on incumbent Ada Colau. During the campaign, his son was arrested at a protest against a squat, for possession of an extendable baton. De Oro said \"it isn't good, but it's understandable\", claiming that residents required arms for self-defence. He referred to Barcelona as the \"European Mecca of illegal immigration and delinquency\" and called its mayor a \"dangerous psychopathic communist\". His party received 37,000 votes and two seats on Barcelona City Council.\nDe Oro was the richest member of the council elected in 2023, with \u20ac800,000 in his bank accounts. He owned four apartments in Barcelona outright, and had shares in other properties and businesses.\nReferences\n^ Revelles, Gisela (18 July 2024). \"Gonzalo de Oro (Vox): \u00abBarcelona ha importado la peor delincuencia de otros pa\u00edses\u00bb\" .

He learned to play electric guitar in the mid-1970s, and used it to play Azerbaijani folk songs and mughams with heavy distortion; he was one of the first to do so.\nM\u0259mm\u0259dli currently teaches tar at a music school in Fuzuli.\nAzerbaijani Gitara Volume 2 was compiled by Ben Wheeler, Stefan Williamson Fa, and Cyril Yeterian, and released on Bongo Joe on 31 May 2024.\nCritical reception\nAdriane Pontecorvo of PopMatters wrote that \"in every song here, M\u0259mm\u0259dli sets high standards in terms of creativity and continuity...the music here stretches wide the bounds of mugham, and R\u0259hman M\u0259mm\u0259dli dazzles.\"\nJim Irvin of Mojo called M\u0259mm\u0259dli's playing \"an extraordinary noise, an acidic tone dialled up in all directions...a stinging sound that could loosen your dentistry.\"\nIn a 5-star review for Songlines, Jim Hickson wrote that \"what is most astonishing is the sheer vocality that  gets out of his guitar. At times there is an uncanny sense that the sounds he makes are literally that of a master singer.\"\nFrancis Gooding of The Wire compared M\u0259mm\u0259dli's sound to a \"cat that has swallowed a laser cannon.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nResearch and liner notes \u2013 Ben Wheeler, Stefan Williamson Fa, and Cyril Yeterian\nDigitisation and scans from original tapes \u2013 Seb Thieme\nMastering \u2013 Jean-Louis Morg\u00e8re\nVinyl cut \u2013 Adi Fl\u00fcck\nArtwork \u2013 Gaspar Capac\nLiner notes Layout \u2013 F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Landrivon\nReferences\n^ a b c d Jakub Knera (2024-05-24), \"Compilation of the Week: R\u0259hman M\u0259mm\u0259dli's Azerbaijani Gitara Volume 2\", The Quietus, retrieved 2024-08-04\n^ a b c d Megan Iacobini de Fazio (2020-09-17), \"The Psychedelic Sound of R\u00fcst\u0259m Quliyev, King of Azerbaijani Guitar\", Bandcamp Daily, retrieved 2024-08-02\n^ a b c d e Clive Davis (2020-10-16), \"Rustem Quliyev: Azerbaijani Gitara review \u2014 mesmerising guitar fusions from a rediscovered star\", The Times, retrieved 2024-08-02\n^ a b c Jim Hickson (January 2021), \"Azerbaijani Gitara (review)\", Songlines, no.\u00a0164, retrieved 2024-08-02\n^ \"R\u00fcst\u0259m Quliyev by R\u00fcst\u0259m Quliyev\", mountainsoftongues.bandcamp.com, retrieved 2024-08-02\n^ a b Francis Gooding (August 2024), \"Azerbaijani Gitara Volume 2 (review)\", The Wire, no.\u00a0486, p.\u00a066\n^ \"Azerbaijani Gitara volume 2\", rhmanmmmdli.bandcamp.com, retrieved 2024-08-04\n^ Noel Gardner (2024-06-09), \"Azerbaijani Gitara: untamed guitar-playing from legendary shredder R\u0259hman M\u0259mm\u0259dli\", Buzz Magazine, retrieved 2024-08-07\n^ a b Jim Irvin (July 2024), \"Stinging lessons\", Mojo, no.\u00a0368, H Bauer Publishing Ltd, p.\u00a0100, ISSN\u00a01351-0193\n^ a b Adriane Pontecorvo (2024-06-03), \"'Azerbaijani Gitara Volume 2' Displays R\u0259hman M\u0259mm\u0259dli's Guitar Genius\", PopMatters, retrieved 2024-08-04\n^ a b Jim Hickson (July 2024), \"Azerbaijani Gitara Volume 2 (review)\", Songlines, no.\u00a0199, MA Education & Music Ltd, p.\u00a060, ISSN\u00a01464-8113, retrieved 2024-08-04\n",

A native of Savannah, Georgia, he moved with his family to Philadelphia around 1920 and soon became involved in local politics. Like the majority of African American voters in that era, he was initially loyal to Republican Party, but he soon switched allegiances and became a Democrat. He worked his way up the party apparatus, culminating in a 1983 stint as acting chair of the city's Democratic committee.\nEarly life and family\nChildhood and move to Philadelphia\nCampbell was born on November 11, 1902, in Savannah, Georgia, his parents' only child. His father, the foreman at a sawmill, lost half of his arm to a workplace accident, and later operated a grocery store.\nHe attended First African Baptist Church with his mother.\nMarriage\nIn 1923, Campbell met Pearl B. Williams, when the two were members of a wedding party together. Williams, the daughter of a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and Campbell married in 1925. She died on September 3, 1974. The couple had two children, who both went on to be active in city politics: Carol Ann and Edgar Jr. (known as \"Sonny\").\nPolitical career\nLater life and death\nCampbell died on September 30, 1987.\nReferences\n^ Campbell, Edgar C.

    "\nFinnish politician (1901\u20131964)\nJohannes Aadolfinpoika Mustonen (5 May 1901\u00a0\u2013 11 May 1964) was a Finnish politician and member of the Parliament of Finland, the national legislature of Finland. A member of the Communist Party of Finland and the Finnish People's Democratic League, he represented Oulu Province between April 1945 and February 1962 and between December 1963 and May 1964. Prior to being elected, he was imprisoned for eight years for political reasons.\nEarly life\nMustonen was born on 5 May 1901 in Paltamo in the centre of the Grand Duchy of Finland. He was the son of crofter Adolf Mustonen and Eva Stiina Kovalainen. He was educated at folk school and Sirola-opisto. He held various jobs including as a paper worker, a sawmill driver and a general labourer. He was forestry worker in Kajaani until 1945.\nPolitics\nMustonen was active in the socialist youth movement in Kajaani from the early 1920s and contested the 1924 municipal elections. His political activities brought him to the attention of the Etsiv\u00e4 keskuspoliisi (EK) secret police (also known as Ohrana). Towards the end of 1924, the EK searched his home and found maps with strange markings belonging to his brother. The EK believed that this indicated that Mustonen was active in the banned Communist Party of Finland (SKP) but did not take any further action.\nMustonen was arrested by the EK on 17 January 1926. On 8 July 1926 the Court of Appeal in Vaasa convicted Mustonen of preparing for high treason and treason and sentenced him to six and three years imprisonment respectively (to serve eight years) with loss of civic rights for ten years. He was released on parole in 1932.\nMustonen was questioned by the state police (Valpo) just prior to the commencement of the Winter War in 1939 but was released as he seemed to have left his communist activities behind since being released from prison. He was a Class II conscript in the Nostov\u00e4ki military reserve and thus did not take part in the Winter War. During the Interim Peace he worked for the Finland\u2013Soviet Union Peace and Friendship Society (SNS) in Kainuu. SNS was banned in December 1940 and several of its administrators arrested but not Mustonen.\nWith the outbreak of the Continuation War in June 1941, Mustonen was amongst hundreds of leftists who were put into preventive detention. He was amongst those political prisoners who were forcibly conscripted into the Detached Battalion 21\u00a0, a penal battalion also known as Detachment P\u00e4rmi, and sent to the front line. He was then sent to the labour camps (Erillinen ty\u00f6komppania). In the spring of 1940 Mustonen's wife requested that he be released but this was opposed by Valpo and the company operating the labour camps for the Finnish regime. However, Valpo subsequently changed its stance and supported his release which happened in autumn 1943.\nMustonen was elected to the Parliament of Finland at the 1945 parliamentary election. He was re-elected at the 1948, 1951, 1954 and 1958 parliamentary elections. He was not re-elected at the 1962 parliamentary election but was appointed to the Parliament of Finland in December 1963 following the death of Yrj\u00f6 Murto.\nMustonen was secretary of the Kainuu branch of the SKP and chairman of the Kainuu branch of the Finnish People's Democratic League (SKDL). He was a presidential elector at the 1950, 1956 and 1962 presidential elections. He was a member of the municipal council in Kajaani.\nMustonen died on 11 May 1964 in Kajaani.\nPersonal life\nMustonen married Anna Maria Leinonen in 1938.\nSee also\nList of Finnish MPs imprisoned for political reasons\nReferences\nCitations\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l \"Kansanedustajat: Janne Mustonen\" (in Finnish).

    "Political party in Austria\nThe Madeleine Petrovic List (German: Liste Madeleine Petrovic; LMP) is a green and COVID-19 sceptical political party in Austria founded by former Green spokeswoman Madeleine Petrovic in May 2024. The party will participate in the 2024 Austrian legislative election in all Austrian states.\nHistory\nMadeleine Petrovic was the federal spokeswoman of The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative from 1994 to 1996 and the state spokeswoman of the Lower Austria party branch for 13 years - she left her position in 2015. Shortly before the split, Madeleine Petrovic called the creation of a new party \"an inevitable step\" as differences between her and The Greens leadership grew.\nThe Madeleine Petrovic List was officially founded on 14 May 2024. The majority of LMP members are former members of the The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative, and a members of the association \"Greens for Fundamental Rights and Freedom of Information\" (German: Gr\u00fcne f\u00fcr Grundrechte und Informationsfreiheit; GGI), previously known as the \"Greens against Compulsory Vaccination & 2G\" (German: Gr\u00fcne gegen Impfpflicht & 2G). The association was founded in 2021 and opposes measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as mandatory vaccination. Petrovic herself is one of the association's prominent members.\nMadeleine Petrovic has announced that her list plans to participate in the 2024 Austrian legislative election. At the beginning of August, Madeleine Petrovic announced that her list had managed to collect all 2,600 signatures to participate in the elections in all states of Austria.\nIdeology\nMadeleine Petrovic named the measures taken by the \u00d6VP-Green government during the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reason for the split. According to Petrovic, her list is aimed at reconciliation after the coronavirus period and active peace politics. In Petrovic's view, the \"mainstream green politics\" has developed in the wrong direction and is \"problematic\". Petrovic believes that her list will attract voters who are critical of the measures to fight COVID-19 and who did not want to vote for the Freedom Party of Austria.\nAlso, the main declared goals of LMP is the protection of the environment and animal rights.\nSee also\nPeter Pilz List\nReferences\n^ https://politpro.eu/en/austria/parties/liste-madeleine-petrovic Liste Madeleine Petrovic Centre-left\n^ a b \"Ex-Gr\u00fcnen-Chefin will mit eigener Liste zur Nationalratswahl antreten\".

He worked as a doctor in various locations in Lithuania (Vilnius, Ukmerg\u0117, Zarasai, Rozalimas, Kaunas). During World War I, he worked with the Red Cross in the Northern Front. After the war, he was long-term  director of the otolaryngology department of Kaunas Red Cross Hospital.\nHe returned to Lithuania in 1918 and joined the Council of Lithuania. As the first director of the Health Department and vice-minister of the interior, Alekna worked on building a healthcare system in Lithuania. He left the government in March 1919, but continued to be active in Lithuanian public life. He was co-founder of the Lithuanian Red Cross (chairman in 1936\u20131940), the Medical Society of Kaunas, Scout Association of Lithuania (chief in 1922\u20131925), and a society to support scouts in Lithuania (chairman in 1919\u20131924 and 1929\u20131935).\nBiography\nRussian Empire\nAlekna was born on 16 February\u00a0\u00a01873 in Sidabrin\u0117\u00a0 near Kukti\u0161k\u0117s in the present-day Utena District Municipality. Alekna grew up in \u017delti\u0161kiai Manor\u00a0 near Skiemonys. He obtained his school education from private teachers. After graduating from the 2nd Vilnius Gymnasium in 1893, he enrolled at Moscow University to study medicine.\nHe graduated in 1898 and was assigned as a doctor to a hospital in the Smolensk Governorate. Few months later, he transferred to the Hospital of St. Jacob\u00a0 in Vilnius and then to Onega in Russia. In 1900, he traveled in western Europe (Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria) learning from local doctors.\nIn 1900, the Tsarist police began a wide investigation of activists connected to Liudas Vaineikis for violations of the Lithuanian press ban. Alekna was arrested in September 1900 as the police found three issues of Varpas in his possession. He spent about two months in a prison in Liep\u0101ja and was sentenced to two years of exile to the Arkhangelsk Governorate. Upon his return to Lithuania, he worked as a physician in Ukmerg\u0117, Zarasai, Rozalimas.\nIn 1909, he completed courses on bacteriology to be able to contribute more in fighting cholera and typhus outbreaks. He then travelled to Berlin and Vienna to study otolaryngology (ear, nose, and throat). He wrote his thesis and earned a PhD in 1910. He returned to Lithuania and worked in Kaunas until he was drafted to the Imperial Russian Army during World War I. He worked with the Red Cross in the Northern Front.\nIndependent Lithuania\nCareer\nAlekna (standing second from right) at the Lithuanian conference in Stockholm\nIn October 1917, Alekna attended the Lithuanian conference in Stockholm which recognized the Council of Lithuania as the main representative of the Lithuanian nation. In February 1918, the Supreme Lithuanian Council in Russia\u00a0 wanted to send three Lithuanian representatives \u2013 Alekna (then residing in Petrograd), Mykolas Sle\u017eevi\u010dius from Voronezh, and Augustinas Voldemaras from Moscow \u2013 to the negotiations of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In May 1918, Alekna led a delegation of Lithuanians from Russia to the Council of Lithuania in Vilnius. The delegation argued for the establishment of armed units from Lithuanian war refugees that would grow into the Lithuanian Army.\nAlekna returned to Lithuania in 1918 and joined the Health Commission of the Council of Lithuania (other members were Jonas Basanavi\u010dius, Steponas Kairys, and Justinas Staugaitis). He was officially coopted by the council on 13 July 1918 when four leftist members resigned in protest of the attempt to establish monarchy in Lithuania. Together with Stasys \u0160ilingas, he represented center-right Democratic National Freedom League known as Santara. In November 1918, the Health Commission was reorganized into the Health Department of the newly formed Ministry of Internal Affairs. Alekna became director of this department (equivalent to minister of health since there was no separate Health Ministry) and vice-minister of the interior. He worked on rebuilding the healthcare system in Lithuania which was devastated by the war. He left the government in March 1919.\nAlekna was a long-term director of the otolaryngology department of Kaunas Red Cross Hospital.

    "2024 single by Grupo Firme and Demi Lovato\nNot to be confused with Chulo (song).\n\"Chula\" is a song by Mexican band Grupo Firme and American singer Demi Lovato, released through Music VIP Entertainment on August 15, 2024. It was written by Lovato, Eduin Caz, Luis Mexia, Manuel Orozco, Warren \"Oak\" Felder, Oscar Linnander, Pablo Preciado, and Sean Douglas, while Felder, Linnander, and Sheeno handled its production. Before its official announcement, both acts premiered the song at a concert in Austin, Texas, as part of the group's La \u00daltima Peda concert tour. \"Chula\" is a Spanglish dance-pop track, which marked a departure from Lovato's rock-infused sound.\nBackground\nAt the end of July 2024, after being asked for new music, American singer Demi Lovato teased the release of a song on social media with a video that she captioned, \"Say you're ready but I bet you not\", quoting the lyrics of the then-upcoming song. In response to the video, the regional Mexican band Grupo Firme wrote three emojis in the comments, hinting at a possible collaboration. Billboard asked the group's leader Eduin Caz about a feature between the two acts, and he said, \"Demi Lovato is an artist whom we've admired since we were kids\". \"We would watch her on television\", he continued, and showed his admiration for the artist. He concluded by saying, \"Luckily the collaboration happened and the song is really good\".\nOn August 2, 2024, at the Austin, Texas stop to the La \u00daltima Peda Tour, a concert tour by Grupo Firme, Lovato appeared by surprise to perform a new song with the frontman of the group, Caz. Titled \"Chula\", it marked the first collaboration between the two acts, and the third single by Lovato with a Latin artist, following her 2017 single \"\u00c9chame la Culpa\" with Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi and her 2023 \"Penhasco2\" with Brazilian singer-songwriter Lu\u00edsa Sonza. While they were singing the song, screens announced its release date for August 15, 2024. A post shared on Grupo Firme's TikTok account showed Lovato and Caz doing a soundcheck before the surprise performance. On August 24, 2024, Lovato performed the song for the second time at the Festival Hera HSBC in Mexico.\nRecording and composition\nAfter Lovato expressed interest in recording a bilingual song, she met the group, distributor mates, in a studio in Los Angeles. \"Chula\" was written by Lovato, Caz, Luis Mexia, Manuel Orozco, Warren \"Oak\" Felder, Oscar Linnander, Pablo Preciado, and Sean Douglas, while Felder, Linnander, and Sheeno handled its production. A dance-pop track with elements of Mexican and electronic music, it marked Lovato's return to pop music following her previous two rock albums, Holy Fvck (2022) and Revamped (2023). \"Chula\" also was a departure from Grupo Firme's usual musical style. In an interview with Rolling Stone's Tom\u00e1s Mier, the Spanish and Native American descent singer said, \"That's what I love about singing in Spanish: It goes back to my literal roots\".\nReception\n\"Chula\" received positive reviews upon its release. Describing it as a \"electrifying duo\", Johan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez Rojas from RCN Radio said that \"Chula\" marked a milestone in Grupo Firme's career, and said that they made a \"irresistible fusion of styles and cultures\". While adding the song to its list of New Music Picks, Univision predicted that \"it will definitely light up the dance floors\". La Prensa dubbed \"Chula\" as a \"contagious song that invites the public to dance\", and praised Lovato's powerful vocals.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Mier, Tom\u00e1s (August 3, 2024). \"Demi Lovato and Grupo Firme Debut Spanglish Dance Collab, 'Chula'\".

    "2024 Czech film\nOur Lovely Pig Slaughter (Czech: Mord, literally Murder) is a 2024 Czech-Slovak comedy drama film directed by Adam Martinec who ha also written the script.The film is a study of Czech nature. According to the director, the film is about different forms and dangers of loneliness, about the fact that not every conversation is conducted with the right words, how little people really listen to each other, or how little they value themselves for standing up for themselves. The film premiered at 49th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival where it received Special Award.\nThe story is accompanied by sharp humor and the visceral rendering of the characters, which, according to the Karlovy Vary festival where the film competed, is reminiscent of the leading works of the Czechoslovak New Wave.\nPlot\nThe story takes place somewhere in the Osobla\u017esko area, where a family meets for an annual tradition - a pig slaughterhouse. However, this time everything is different than usual.\nCast\nKarel Martinec\nMiloslav \u010c\u00ed\u017eek\nPavl\u00edna Balner\nAle\u0161 B\u00edl\u00edk\nAlbert \u010cuba\nKarin B\u00edl\u00edkov\u00e1 V\u00e1pen\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1\nZden\u011bk Pech\u00e1\u010dek\nProduction\nThe film is inspired by Adam Martinec's childhood and growing up in the north of Moravia. Based on his own script, Martinec directed his feature directorial debut himself. It was filmed in Krnov, where the director was born, and the story was filled with actors and non-actors including his father and his real neighbors. On the contrary, the slaughterhouse, which is the main theme of the film, did not actually take place during filming and was simulated with the help of pieces of meat from the slaughterhouse in order to protect the animals from stress.\nThe film was co-produced by Czech Television.\nReferences\n^ Krest\u00fdn, Michal; Kuba, Franti\u0161ek (28 June 2024). \"Krnovan\u00e9 ve Varech uvedou sv\u011btovou premi\u00e9ru filmu Mord\".

    "Crimean Tatar denialism is the idea that the Crimean Tatars are not a distinct ethnic group. After the deportation of the Crimean Tatars, the Soviet government no longer recognized Crimean Tatars as a distinct ethnic group and forbade internal passports and official documents from using the term in the nationality section despite previously permitting it. The non-recognition of Crimean Tatars was emphasized by the wording of Ukaz 493, which used the euphemism \"Citizens of Tatar nationality formerly living in Crimea.\" Only in 1989 were all restrictions on the use of the term lifted.\nOrigins of Crimean Tatars\nDespite the name, Crimean Tatars do not originate from Tatarstan. Instead, they are composed of four main sub-ethnic groups of different origins. The Steppe Crimean Tatars are of Kipchak Nogay origin; the Mountain Tats descend from all pre-Nogay inhabitants of Crimea who adopted Islam; the Yaliboylu Crimean Tatars are Oghuz descend from coastal Europeans like Greeks, Italians, and Armenians who converted to Islam after the arrival of the Golden Horde; and the Crimean Roma are a mixture of different waves of Romani Muslims who came to Crimea before Russian rule.\nPseudoscientific theory of Crimean Tatar origins\nMany Communist Party members mistakenly believed that the Crimean Tatars were a diaspora of Volga Tatars from the Tatar ASSR, now called Tatarstan. Crimean Tatars who asked the government to restore Crimean ASSR were told by the government that it was inexpedient to restore their republic since the Tatar ASSR already existed, even though the government restored the national republics of the other deported ethnic groups.\nDenialism and Censorship\nBefore the deportation of Crimean Tatars in 1944, the term Crimean Tatar was widely allowed to be used in censuses, academic literature, and general use in cultural life. Still, after the deportation, the term was subject to censorship.\nThe very first sentence of Decree no. 5859ss, the decree ordering the deportation of Crimean Tatars, used the term Crimean Tatar, specifically saying, \"many Crimean Tatars betrayed the Motherland.\" Later government decrees about Crimean Tatars avoided using the term \"Crimean Tatar\"; Ukaz 493 of 1967 said that accusations of universal treason laid against Crimean Tatars were unreasonable described Crimean Tatars not as Crimean Tatars but only as \"Citizens of Tatar nationality, formerly living in the Crimea.\" Throughout the era of the Crimean Tatar exile, the Soviet government made many attempts to cover up the existence of Crimean Tatars as a distinct ethnic group to the Soviet public to maintain a fiction that Crimean Tatars were a subgroup of the Volga Tatars.\nWhile Crimean Tatars were able to get away with using their ethnonym in passing mention in limited circumstances, like occasional mentions in the newspaper Lenin Bayra\u011f\u0131, usage of the term \"Crimean Tatar\" was almost always successfully censored. All token Crimean Tatar cultural activities were treated as manifestations of a subgroup of the Volga Tatars. The Crimean Tatar dance ensemble Haytarma was forbidden from calling itself a Crimean Tatar dance group; Titles of books about Crimean Tatar music and the Crimean Tatar language were never allowed to use the word Crimean Tatar, and instead used vague titles that were non-specific to the subject being Crimean Tatar. Even the Crimean Tatar language department of the Nizami State Literature Institute in Tashkent could not be called a Crimean Tatar language faculty and was named \"Tatlit\" instead. Only in perestroika were Crimean Tatar academics allowed to use the term \"Crimean Tatar\" in their dissertations about their language.\nOver time, the government went beyond simply censoring the word \"Crimean Tatar\", and by 1983, Lenin Bayra\u011f\u0131 was prohibited from using many words important to Crimean Tatar identity. The restrictions went beyond forbidding the use of Crimean Tatar language names for Crimean toponyms mentioned in articles, but also the term \"Crimean ASSR\" and even \"Crimean Radio Committee.\"\nIn the Surgun era, Crimean Tatar musicians were forbidden from performing songs that alluded to or were perceived as alluding to Crimea. The lyrics of the songs were limited to very narrow themes, such as cotton.\nMisrepresentations of nationality of Crimean Tatars heroes\nUzeir Abduramanov, a full-blooded Crimean Tatar born and raised in Crimea, was labeled as an Azerbaijani in a photo gallery of Heroes of the Soviet Union in a 1944 issue of the popular magazine Ogonyok. Crimean Tatar national hero and double Hero of the Soviet Union Amet-khan Sultan always personally identified himself as a Crimean Tatar, and was described as a Crimean Tatar in newspaper articles about his heroism that were published before the deportation, but was often described as a Dagestani in post-deportation media, such as in his obituary in the newspaper Dagestan Pravda.\nReturn of the term\nOnly in 1989 were Crimean Tatars recognized as a separate ethnic group",
    "Welsh government (2024)\nEluned Morgan formed her government on 6 August and 7 August 2024 following her appointment as first minister of Wales on 6 August. She appointed former First Minister Mark Drakeford as her successor to her former role as Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, a role he himself held between 2013 and 2016, and designated Elisabeth Jones as Counsel General-designate.\nThe remaining posts in her government would be a continuation of the previous Gething government in interim, until Autumn 2024, when a full cabinet reshuffle is expected.\nIn addition to her cabinet appointments, Morgan also appointed former MP Kevin Brennan as her leading special adviser.\nHistory\nEluned Morgan was nominated and appointed to succeed Vaughan Gething as first minister of Wales on 6 August 2024. Later that day, she announced the appointment of Huw Irranca-Davies as her deputy first minister. This was the first time a deputy first minister had been appointed to the Welsh Government since Ieuan Wyn Jones in 2007.\nMorgan announced the rest of her cabinet on 7 August. Her first cabinet was appointed to serve on an interim basis, with most members of her government retaining the same posts they had in the previous Gething government. Changes included the appointment of former first minister Mark Drakeford as the interim cabinet secretary for health and social care, succeeding Morgan as the previous officeholder, as well as Elisabeth Jones as the counsel general-designate to act as the counsel general for Wales for an interim period. Morgan retained her previous responsibility for the Welsh language. The cabinet will remain in place for an interim period until September 2024, when a full cabinet reshuffle \"following a listening exercise over the summer with the Welsh public\" is planned.\nIn addition to her cabinet, Morgan also appointed former MP Kevin Brennan, who had served as former first minister Rhodri Morgan's chief of staff, as her leading special adviser.\nCabinets\nAugust\u2013September 2024\nCabinet Secretaries\nMinisters\nOther appointments\nKevin Brennan \u2013 special adviser to the First Minister\nSee also\nShadow Cabinet of Wales\nMembers of the 6th Senedd\nReferences\n^ Frampton, Ben; Grey, Jack; Pigott, Paul (6 August 2024). \"Live Reporting: Reaction as Eluned Morgan confirmed as Wales' first minister\".

    "\nDominican general and revolutionary\nAntonio Caba was a Dominican soldier and military leader. He was a hero in both the wars of Independence and Restoration against Haiti and Spain respectively. He was killed in the Battle of Sabana de San Pedro, in the latter conflict, this making him a martyr.  \nPersonal life\nHe was a resident in Taveras, located in Santiago. His wife was Rosa Fern\u00e1ndez. He had been a soldier of the Dominican War of Independence.\nWar against Spain\nIn September 1863, he formed his own troops with men recruited in the jurisdiction of Jarabacoa, and marched towards La Vega to put himself at the disposal of General Gregorio Luper\u00f3n, recently appointed chief of Operations for the Southern and Eastern regions. Caba was sent to Monte Plata, a point of bitter fighting between the Spanish forces and Dominican revolutionaries. Courageous to the point of bordering on recklessness; responsible and punctual\nagainst all commitments, with a heightened sense of honor, he had to be among the who were with Luper\u00f3n in the Battle of Sabana de San Pedro on January 23, 1864, a difficult task for the Dominicans. In a bold advance, General Luper\u00f3n was surrounded by the Spanish cavalry commanded at that moment by Juan Suero and Antonio Abad. In a titanic duel with the enemy, General Luper\u00f3n was wounded by three sword blows; knocked off his mule and about to die from iron and lead. Caba advanced to the aid of his commander and in effort heroically, he offered his life to save that of his boss, who left the siege mounted on his mule that, although unsaddled, could be recovered by its owner. When talking about that episode and the courage demonstrated by Antonio\nCaba, some historians citea fragment of the submitted part by the Spanish captain Vicente de Ceballos, present in the combat, to Captain General Carlos de Vargas:\n...General Caba says in the report, he died like a brave man, defending himself until he could no longer hold on to the bayonets of the Hunters of the Queen's Battalion who were the ones who they killed him.\nHe was one of the four generals killed in combat in that war on the side of the patriots. The others were Gregorio de Lora, Santiago Mota and Benito Mart\u00ednez.\nSee also\nGregorio de Lora\nSantiago Mota\nBenito Mart\u00ednez\nGregorio Luper\u00f3n\nReferences\n^ Mej\u00eda, Rafael Chaljub (2007).

    "Protected area in Dorset, England\nDorset National Landscape is a National Landscape area in Dorset, southern England, formerly known as and still legally designated as the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The conservation designation means that the area is protected and promoted for its landscape value. The area was established in 1959, one of the early wave of National Landscapes to receive the designation.\nDorset National Landscape covers an area of 436 square miles (1,129\u00a0km2), nearly 43% of the area of the ceremonial county of Dorset. It includes most of the Dorset section of the Jurassic Coast, England's only natural World Heritage Site, plus three Ramsar sites, nine Special Areas of Conservation, and three Special Protection Areas.  Other parts of Dorset included in the designation are the chalk hills of the Dorset Downs, the Isle of Purbeck and Poole Harbour, and the vales and rolling hills in the west of the county.\nAround 75,000 people live within the boundaries of the area, which encompass the towns of Beaminster, Bridport, Lyme Regis and Swanage. The area includes several popular tourist attractions, and tourists made an estimated 12.6 million day trips and 1.8 million staying trips to the area in 2016.\nLandscape areas and land use\nThe Dorset National Landscape area includes a variety of landscape types.\nA large inland part of the area covers the Dorset Downs, an area of chalk downland with escarpments and chalk stream valleys noted for its calcareous grassland habitat. The Purbeck Hills form a separate narrow chalk ridge with escarpments in the southeast of the area. There is substantial arable land use on the chalk downland. North of Blandford Forum, the National Landscape area shares a boundary with the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs National Landscape, which includes other sections of Southern England's chalk formation.\nUnder the escarpments of the chalk hills are broad clay valleys, and the National Landscape area includes the Bride Valley, Corfe Valley, and a small part of the Blackmore Vale. The valleys contain substantial areas of pasture land use, typically for dairy farming, patchworked with wet woodland and meadow habitats.\nIn the east, Poole Harbour featured tidal mudflats and marshland habitats, bordered by the Purbeck Heaths lowland heathland landscape, a small part of the Dorset Heaths (which otherwise largely lie outside the National Landscape). South of these is the Purbeck Plateau, an area of exposed limestone upland with a dramatic coastline and calcareous grassland habitat.\nIn the west, the area contains a mixed landscape of rolling sandstone hills with high cliffs along the Jurassic Coast, and further broad clay valleys, including the Marshwood Vale and Powerstock Vale. These hills support oak and ash woodlands, scrub habitats, and livestock farming. Here, the Dorset National Landscape shares a boundary with the Blackdown Hills National Landscape area.\nRecreation and tourism\nA visitor centre and car park occupy a hillside at Lulworth Cove, a popular attraction in the Dorset National Landscape.\nThe coast and countryside in the National Landscape area are valued for its recreational amenity value, with the Dorset National Landscape Partnership recognising pressure from a population of 2.15 million people who live within 40 miles of the National Landscape. The towns of Dorchester, Poole and Weymouth are immediately adjacent to the boundary.\nThe natural beauty of the area attracts tourism, and there are several attractions within the boundary that have been described as tourist honeypot sites, including Abbotsbury, Cerne Abbas, Durdle Door, Lulworth Cove, and Lyme Regis.\nVisitor spending was estimated to support nearly 13,000 full-time equivalent jobs and contribute nearly \u00a3860 million to the local economy in 2016. Tourism creates challenges for the area, including the seasonal nature of many employment and business opportunities, and visitor management at some of the most popular locations, particularly on the coast, where surges in visitor numbers can overwhelm the rural infrastructure. Tourism puts pressure on the landscape through erosion, litter, traffic and car parking, the need to provide visitor facilities, and competition for local services. The Purbeck Heaths area of the National Landscape is additionally vulnerable to fire caused by visitors. These pressures were experienced especially acutely during the summers of 2020 and 2021, when the Covid-19 pandemic made international tourism difficult, leading to a surge of domestic tourism in the area.\nGovernance and ownership\nLewesdon Hill, one of several National Trust properties in the National Landscape.\nAlthough branded as a \"National Landscape\", the legal designation for the area is Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This designation does not affect land ownership, and most of the Dorset National Landscape area is privately owned by farms, estates and households.\nSome of the land is owned and ",
    "Military unit\n83rd Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Army is a reserve unit activated and organized in late 1941 few months before WW II commenced in the Philippines. It fought in Cebu Island during Japanese landings in April 1942 but ordered surrendered in May 1942. It was disbanded after all soldiers were POWs but some escaped and joined the guerilla movement in Cebu.\nOrganization\nThe regiment was activated with reserve soldiers coming mostly from Cebu and Bohol islands. Officers came from the main island of Luzon including its commander Lieutenant Colonel Fortunato Borbon a PC officer. The regiment was still organizing went hostilities broke in December 1941, and soldiers has not been full trained neither fired its issues weapons. Except for the 3rd Battalion under Major Arthur Grimes were it was left in Bohol to organized its defense in the island the entire regiment was transferred to the Northern part of Cebu Island with headquarters in Liloan town. In January 1942 the 81st Infantry Division Headquarters and its supporting units were ordered transferred to Mindanao. 83rd and 82nd Infantry were left to maintain the island defense. The 2 infantry regiments along with 808th MP Regiment comprises the Cebu Brigade under Colonel Irvine Scudder. In April, Lieutenant Colonel Rufus Rodgers took over the command of the regiment and continued the training of his men.\nJapanese landing in Cebu\nA new command was established Visayas Force to command all forces in the Visayas islands. Its commander Brigadier General Bradford Chynoweth established his headquarters at Camp X, Cantabaco in the southern Cebu. Realizing the critical point in securing the cross-island highway ordered Major Grimes to transfer 3rd Battalion, 83rd Infantry to Cebu from Bohol.    \nCommander of 83rd Infantry Regiment during battle of Cebu in April 1942.\nKawaguchi Detachment landed in the southern coasts of Cebu on April 17, 1942, which 82nd Infantry Regiment fought hard to repulse these landings in Toledo and Talisay moving towards Cantabaco. 3rd Battalion was tasked to secure the town but after few skirmishes the overwhelming Japanese firepower with naval and air support was too much and they were forced to retreat inland. A demolition was set but when it failed to explode Major Grimes moved forward to scout the Japanese position but he was never seen again.\nGeneral Chynoweth ordered Colonel Rodgers who was in Liloan, to send reinforcements but due to lack of motor vehicles to transport one of his battalion it took them longer to reach Cebu by walking but a confusion of the order made the battalion turned around losing time to reinforce Cantabaco. it was lost and entire Visayas Force Headquarters retreated towards mountainous area of Sudlon. The defense of Cebu was disorganized in April 19, it was considered lost and communication was not established between forces outside Cebu and Visayas Force HQ and it was dissolved by General Wainwright.\nSurrender\nOn May 12, 1942, upon order of General William F.

    "August 2024 bombing of a school in an Israeli attack\nOn 4 August 2024, the Israel Defense Forces bombed Hamama School in the Gaza neighborhood of Sheikh Radwan. The school had been sheltering people displaced by the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, including women and children. Per Gaza's Civil Defense, 17 people were killed and \"many others\" were wounded, while the school itself was \"completely destroyed\". The attack was one of a number of attacks on schools during the Israeli invasion of Gaza. The Israeli army stated that the school was being used by Hamas. Hamas criticized this claim as a false pretext \"for targeting defenseless civilians\". The Palestinian Resistance Movement called the attack a continuation of Israel's \"brutal war of extermination\" in Gaza.\nBackground\nOn 6 July, UNRWA-ran al-Jawni school sheltering 2,000 refugees at the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza was targeted by an IDF raid which killed sixteen Palestinians. On 7 July, the IDF targeted the Latin Patriarchate-owned Holy Family school located in Gaza City housing hundreds of refugees, killing four. On 8 July, IDF force struck a different Nuseirat UNRWA-run school in, causing several injuries requiring treatment in a local hospital. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, stated two-thirds of all UNRWA schools in Gaza had been hit since October 2023.\nA United Nations Security Council Resolution adopted on 25 March 2024 had demanded an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas War. The attack on the Hamama School coincided with truce talks in Egypt.\nAttack\nOn 4 August, Israeli aircraft struck the Hamama School with a missile. Then, while first responders were rescuing victims of the initial strike, three additional missiles were fired at the school, killing more people and trapping some under rubble. This tactic is commonly used by the Israeli military. No warning was given prior to the first strike. Women and children were among the casualties. According to the Gaza Civil Defense, the Al-Hamama School was targeted alongside the adjacent Al-Huda School, which share a playground.\nReferences\n^ Yee, Vivian; Abuheweila, Iyad; Harouda, Ameera. \"Israeli Strike on Gaza Shelter Kills at Least 30 and Injures Dozens\".

    "Mountain in Montana, United States\nHenderson Mountain is a 10,343-foot (3,153-metre) summit in Park County, Montana, United States.\nDescription\nHenderson Mountain is located 2.4 miles (3.9\u00a0km) north of Cooke City, Montana, in the Beartooth Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. It is set within the New World Mining District and the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's north slope drains into Fisher Creek which is a tributary of the Clarks Fork Yellowstone River, whereas the south slope drains into Miller Creek \u2192 Soda Butte Creek \u2192 Lamar River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises nearly 1,400 feet (427 meters) above Fisher Creek in 0.6 miles (0.97\u00a0km). The mountain is a laccolith composed of Cambrian limestone, breccia, and Eocene dacite porphyry. Gold was discovered on Henderson Mountain in 1888. In the mid-1990s, Henderson Mountain was the epicenter of legal fighting over plans to mine a billion dollars' worth of gold and silver from the mountain which would threaten nearby Yellowstone National Park. The environmental controversy ended when the US government bought out the mining claim. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names, and has been featured in publications since at least 1893. Bart Henderson was one of the four trappers who discovered the New World Mining District in 1869, with the others being Adam Miller, J. H. Moore, and James Gourley. (Miller Mountain is 1.61 miles (2.59\u00a0km) west-southwest of Henderson Mountain).\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Henderson Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F.\nSee also\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Henderson Mountain, Montana\".

    "\nUnrecognized state, Azerbaijani nationalist project\nThe Goyche-Zangezur Republic (Azerbaijani: G\u00f6y\u00e7\u0259-Z\u0259ng\u0259zur Respublikas\u0131; Turkish: G\u00f6k\u00e7e-Zengezur Cumhuriyeti) is an Azerbaijani nationalist project which claims that the region of Zangezur and Lake Sevan (Goyche) are rightful lands of the Goyche-Zangezur Republic. The Goyche-Zangezur Republic does not control the lands it claims and is a government-in-exile based in Turkey.\nHistory\nThe republic originates from the irredentist concept of Western Azerbaijan, which was promoted by the government of Azerbaijan, especially during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict after the Second Karabakh War, where Ilham Aliyev regularly referred Yerevan as \"Irevan\", Lake Sevan as \"G\u00f6y\u00e7\u0259\", and Syunik as \"Zangazur\", claiming that they were original Azerbaijani lands and will be once again.\nOn September 19, 2022, a group of ethnic Azerbaijanis who belonged to the Azerbaijani community of the region, which were forced to leave it after the collapse of the USSR, announced the establishment of the Goyche-Zangezur Republic. The statement contained the structure of the future government of the republic and announced the convening of its parliament (Milli M\u0259clis) within a month; the capital of the republic was supposed to be the city of Kapan or Vardenis. Many Azerbaijani officials and academics endorsed the Goyche-Zangezur Republic. The republic also carried out activities based in Turkey. Turkey was the first to recognise it.\nOn September 20, representatives of the Western Azerbaijan Community protested against the Goyche-Zangezur Republic initiative, calling it \"unacceptable and harmful.\" There were also accusations that controversial Azerbaijani activist Rizvan Talibov was behind the project. Deputy of the Azerbaijani parliament Malakhat Hasanova strongly condemned the initiative, stating that the topic of \"returning\" the parts of Armenia which are \"originally Azerbaijani lands\" back to Azerbaijan should be determined only by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, and not by \"incomprehensible activists\". Some regional experts claimed that the proclamation of the Goyche-Zangezur Republic was beneficial only to Armenia and Iran. At the same time, some commentators claimed that the idea of the Goyche-Zangezur Republic within Armenia is a kind of mirror reflection of the desired status of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic within Azerbaijan, and therefore such an initiative could play a role in diplomatic pressure on Armenia to open the Zangezur corridor. In 2020, there was a similar project when a group of Azerbaijani activists claimed the creation of the Yerevan Turkic Republic.\nDuring 2023, there was information that Rizvan Talibov was suspended from the management of the Goyche-Zangezur Republic project by his foreign counterparties and the place of the head of the republic was taken by Tunzala Chelebiyeva, who lived in Turkey. On August 10, it became known that Talibov and Chelebiyeva, who came to Azerbaijan, were arrested by the State Security Service of Azerbaijan. Leaders of the Goyche-Zangezur Republic released a statement saying \"today, all Western Azerbaijanis are confident that their violated rights will be restored in the presence of the political will of the President of Azerbaijan and the forces of our state. Therefore, they should be united by a single intention, avoid any divisive steps that create confusion, and fight together for the return to Western Azerbaijan - our native lands.\"\nReferences\n^ Broers 2019, p.\u00a0117. sfn error: no target: CITEREFBroers2019 (help)\n^ G\u00f6y\u00e7\u0259-Z\u0259ng\u0259zur Respublikas\u0131 yarad\u0131ld\u0131 \u2014 B\u018fYANAT Archived 2022-09-19 at the Wayback Machine // 7 times, 19.09.2022.\n^ \"The rise and fall of Azerbaijan's \"Goycha-Zangazur Republic\"\". eurasianet.org.

    "Island in Mozambique\nBangu\u00e9 (Portuguese pronunciation: ) is a small sandy barrier island in the Bazaruto Archipelago of southern Mozambique, situated between Magaruque Island and the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o Peninsula to the south. Formed through wave action later than the other islands of the archipelago, it is a largely barren dune island with limited vegetation and no permanent inhabitants. It is occasionally visited by local fishermen and various seabirds. The islet is part of Bazaruto Archipelago National Park, and its surrounding waters form a vital habitat for dugong and sea turtles.\nGeography\nBangu\u00e9 is the smallest and southernmost island in the Bazaruto Archipelago of southern Mozambique, lying south of Magaruque Island and 5.4 kilometres (3.4\u00a0mi) north of the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o Peninsula. A narrow sandy islet, it measures 5 hectares (12 acres). Unlike the other islands, it formed through deposition of sediment by waves in the tidal delta created by the archipelago. As its creation was dependent on the existence of the chain itself, it formed much later, likely within the past 3,000\u20134,000 years.\nClimate\nThe Bazaruto archipelago, like most of Mozambique, has a tropical savanna climate, designated as Aw according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. The area experiences an annual rainfall of around 978\u00a0mm (38.5\u00a0in) and an average temperature of 24\u00a0\u00b0C (75\u00a0\u00b0F), with highs up to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) during the summer and lows of 18\u00a0\u00b0C (64\u00a0\u00b0F) during the winter. Water temperatures in the surrounding area range from 24\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (75\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F). Bangu\u00e9 lies within a high-risk area for tropical cyclone activity.\nEcology\nEntirely composed of sand dunes, vegetation on Bangu\u00e9 is limited to a small number of species which thrive on pioneer sand dunes\u2014dunes directly adjacent to the beach. Various seabirds visit the island, including grey herons, greater flamingos, grey-headed gulls, ruddy turnstones, common sandpipers, wood sandpipers, common ringed plovers, and grey plovers. Dugong live around the island, forming the southernmost extent of the largest population in East Africa. This may be the last population viable in the long-term in the southwestern Indian Ocean. Sea turtles are also found around the island, including green, loggerhead, leatherback, and hawksbill turtles. However, turtle nesting on Bangu\u00e9 is disrupted by the island's high rates of erosion.\nThe island is uninhabited, although it occasionally hosts camps by local fishermen. Alongside Magaruque and Benguerua, it was part of the initial territory designated as part of the Bazaruto Archipelago National Park in 1971.\nReferences\nCitations\n^ Downs & Wirminghaus 1997, p.\u00a0592.\n^ Everett, van der Elst & Schleyer 2008, p.\u00a010.\n^ a b Dutton & Zolho 1990, p.\u00a016.\n^ Cuamba et al. 2005, p.\u00a084.\n^ Cooper & Pilkey 2002, pp.\u00a0164\u2013166.\n^ a b Findlay, Cockcroft & Guissamulo 2011, pp.\u00a0441\u2013443.\n^ Downs & Wirminghaus 1997, p.\u00a0593.\n^ van der Elst 2008, pp.\u00a055\u201360.\n^ a b Dutton & Zolho 1990, pp.\u00a026\u201327.\n^ Litulo et al. 2018.\n^ Reina 1998, p.\u00a079.\n^ Maggs et al. 2010, p.\u00a0116.\nSources\nCooper, J.

He provided her with a solid foundation in Russian classical dance and consistently emphasized the importance of national character in art. Their collaborative work resulted in Tattimbet, which is still considered one of the best Kazakh dances.\nPulysh in the play Maidan (Battle) by B. Mailin was Shara's first role in Auezov Theater. She also performed the roles of Enlik and Karagoz in Enlik-Kebek and Karagoz plays by Mukhtar Auezov, and others.\nIn 1934, Zhienkulova joined the theater of drama and music now known as The Kazakh National Opera and Ballet Theatre named after Abay) where she performed folk dances in Auezov's musical drama Ayman-Sholpan, as well as operas Kyz-Zhibek, Zhalbyr and Er Targhin by Yevgeny Brusilovsky.

She served as the director of Almaty Choreographic College from 1966 until 1975.\nTo develop national dance art, Zhienkulova traveled extensively across auls, studying ancient rituals, national costumes, traditions and cultural heritage of her people. She created such unforgettable dances as Tattimbet, Ayzhan Kyz, Kara Jorga and Kyryk Kyz.\nWhen the folk department of the Almaty Choreographic College opened in 1965, she placed Kazakh dance on a professional footing with her own teaching methodologies.\nShara Zhienkulova has been called a diamond of musical and plastic arts. Gulfairus Ismailova painted Kazakh Waltz for her. It is also the name of one of Zhienkulova's most famous productions, set to the music by Khamidi. Kazakh Waltz was first performed during the 10-day Festival of Kazakh Literature and Arts in the Bolshoi in Moscow in 1968 by an all-female group of dancers and was later showcased in the Soviet Union and abroad.\nShara Zhienkulova died on May 21, 1991, 40 days after the death of her son Bulat Dzhandarbekov, she was buried next to him in the Kensai cemetery in Almaty.\nFilmography\nFamily\nShara was the first wife of opera singer Kurmanbek Dzhandarbekov.

    "Black British activist (born 1950)\nZainab Abbas (born 1950) is a Black British activist working for women\u2019s rights and social change, who has been a notable participant since the late 1960s and '70s in various key organisations of the UK black power movement, such as the Black Liberation Front, the British Black Panthers, and the Brixton Black Women's Group,\nBiography\nAbbas was born in 1950, in Middlesbrough, in the north of England, to an Egyptian family of Nubian descent. Her mother had worked as a nurse in Palestine before leaving for reasons of safety because of the unrest there; as Abbas shared in an interview: \"Mother\u2019s background was that she was raised in an orphanage in Egypt, and the good thing about being raised in an orphanage, probably the only good thing, was she got an education. So she was able to go to university and qualify as a nurse....\n\"She was brought to the UK by a major in the British army and his family....They were nice and just wanted to get her into Britain. She went down to London and there she met my dad. Then I know she worked in the health service as a nurse....\n\"I lost my father when I was very young. My mother raised five of the six of us, because my sister died, as a single parent. She was very inventive, I\u2019ve had a great deal of respect all my life for my mother.\"\nAbbas has spoken of the effect the US Black Power movement had on her as a teenager; she was particularly impressed by hearing Stokely Carmichael speak in July 1967 at the Roundhouse in London, where she had hitchhiked to attend her first ever political meeting. She also recalls the impact of hearing James Brown's 1968 \"Say It Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud)\", as well as being inspired by Malcolm X.\nIn 1971, she moved down to Birmingham, in the West Midlands, where she joined the Birmingham Black Panthers and taught in the black supplementary school system. Then, in 1971, she went to London, joining the Black Liberation Front (BLF). The organisation was affiliated with the International Panther network, and as the BLF's international secretary, Abbas liaised with the US Panthers, developing a lasting friendship with Kathleen Cleaver.\nIn 1973, Abbas joined with Gerlin Bean (whom she saw as a mentor), Beverley Bryan, Olive Morris, Liz Obi and other activists to found the Brixton Black Women's Group (BBWG), an influential and foundational Black feminist grouping.\nAbbas, together with Bean and Ansel Wong, was in the British delegation to the Sixth Pan-African Congress, which was hosted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in 1974. The UK delegates' address to the Congress reiterated the commitment of Black Britons to the liberation of Africans, people of African descent, and others throughout the world, from colonial policies, imperialism, and racism.\nIn 1980, Abbas started the first Black-owned public relations company in the UK and she has worked extensively on public affairs in Africa and the Middle East.\nAbbas is among those interviewed in the 2021 film Black Power: A British Story of Resistance, directed by George Amponsah. On 13 July 2024, she was a leading participant in the inaugural Black Lives Matter UK Festival of Collective Liberation held at Friends House in London, attended by more than 600 activists and supporters.\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Uprisings! 40 years on: Media, Terminology & Representation\".

    "Gaelic football competition\nThe 2025 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship will be the 138th edition of the Gaelic Athletic Association's premier inter-county Gaelic football tournament.\nArmagh will be the defending champions having won the 2024 competition. Down will enter the competition as Tailteann Cup winners.\nFormat\nA potential new format for the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship (SFC) is under consideration, with a single alternative structure gaining significant support. The proposal is set to be discussed at a GAA Central Council meeting in September 2024. The format, inspired by systems previously used in 16-team county championships, emerged as the most favoured option during a recent consultation process involving GAA counties.\nKey Features of the Proposed Format\nThe alternative format retains the provincial championships and introduces a new pathway for teams advancing to the All-Ireland series. After the completion of the provincial competitions, the eight provincial finalists would join the top seven National Football League teams and the Tailteann Cup winners in the first round of the Sam Maguire Cup. The outcome of this round would determine the placement of teams into two groups: winners and losers.\nQuarter-Final Qualification\nThe winners of the provincial winners' group would secure direct qualification for the All-Ireland quarter-finals. The remaining quarter-final spots would be contested between the provincial losers\u2019 group winners and the losers of the provincial winners' group.\nGame Structure\nThe proposed format involves 27 games across six rounds, a reduction from the current 35 games over seven rounds. This streamlining is aimed at easing scheduling pressure and creating a clearer gap between the league and the provincial championships.\nMinimum Games Guarantee\nCounties would be assured at least three championship games, down from the four currently guaranteed.\n\nReferences\n^ \"Armagh: All-Ireland winners to be welcomed home by fans\".

In 2015, Harper authored GreenFaith: Mobilizing God\u2019s People to Protect the Earth, after conducting hundreds of interviews with people of various faiths about divine experiences involving nature.\nIn 2021, Harper condemned COP 29's lack of addressing corporate responsibility for climate change and advised faith leaders:\"First, clergy need to name what is creating this problem ... For religious leaders, this means ... getting comfortable saying things like: \u201cExxonMobil, BP, Shell, and other oil and gas companies are systematically destroying the planet \u2014 and financial giants like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, and Vanguard are bankrolling the destruction.\u201d ... We must make it clear that these companies, their shareholders, our government, and those working for these institutions must change ... This is not a time for preachers to play it safe; it is time for prophetic thunder. The well-being of billions of people and the planet\u2019s future hang in the balance.\"\nIncreased activity\nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina \"marked a surge of activity\" for GreenFaith, as its ensuing environmental disasters \"cast a spotlight\" on the effects of climate change on vulnerable communities. Following the 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, more faith-based organizations prioritized environmental justice and stewardship in their practices, leading to increased GreenFaith collaborations.\nAnother surge in membership occurred in 2009, after what Biohabitats named the \"spectacular failure\" of the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Harper explained that the negotiations' ineffectiveness inspired faith-based organizations to take a stronger stance on climate change, such as inspiring activism and divestment from fossil fuels. Harper stated this helped inspire interfaith solidarity events, such as the People's Climate March of 2014, of which GreenFaith was an organizer.\nActivism\nIn 2015, GreenFaith organized 20,000 people worldwide to take part in a Global Climate March, the day before Paris's U.N. Climate Change Conference.\nThe same year, GreenFaith led the Una Terra, Una Familglia Humana (lit.\u2009'One Earth, One Human Family') Climate Change March in Vatican City.\nGreenFaith was among the organizers of the 2017 People's Climate March in Washington, D.C.\nIn June 2018, GreenFaith collaborated with the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies on the Bhumi Project to mobilize Hindus against climate change.Jane Fonda speaks at Washington, D.C.'s Fire Drill Fridays protest, 2019.On December 6, 2019, GreenFaith protested the financial institutions in Washington, D.C. that profited from fossil fuel projects and immigrant detention. American actress Jane Fonda spoke at the protest.\nIn October 2021, Roman Catholic association Sisters of Mercy of the Americas protested fossil fuels and the climate emergency outside Bay View Academy in Riverside, Rhode Island. The sisters cited their support of GreenFaith's Washington D.C. protests calling for green energy, commending the marches' leadership by Native American ",
    "1980 studio album by Alexander Gradsky\nRusskiye pesni (Russian: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438; transl.\u2009Russian songs), subtitled Syuita na temy narodnykh pesen (Russian: \u0421\u044e\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d; transl.\u2009Folk Songs Suite), is a studio album by Russian singer-songwriter Alexander Gradsky released in 1980 through Melodiya. It was the first full-length rock record officially released in the Soviet Union. The album is a conceptual one and consists of Russian folk songs in a modern rock treatment.\nThe album was recorded with the participation of Gradsky's musical band Skoromorokhi\u00a0.\nBackground\nThe idea of recording this album came to Alexander Gradsky in 1976, when, as a student of the Moscow Conservatory, he participated in recording and decoding works of Russian folklore. The first five tracks of the album were recorded in 1976, the final three in 1979.\nThe music and lyrics of most of the songs are traditional; Gradsky prepared arrangements of all the compositions, as well as completed the last verse in the \"Tanya belaya\". In addition, the album included the revolutionary song \t\"Vy zhertvoyu pali\", written at the end of the XIX century by Anton Amosov; when recording, an instrumental fragment was added to the end of the song.\nThe synthesizer Synthi 100, brought to the USSR by Peter Zinovieff, the creator of EMS, was widely used in the recording of the album.\nCritical reception\nWriter and journalist Vasiliy Golovanov, on the pages of Yunost magazine in March 1985, named the album among the most significant domestic works that managed to \"squeeze out\" English-language rock.\nIn a retrospective review for Colta, Denis Boyarinov stated that Gradsky does not try to fit a folk song to rock and roll schemes, does not engage in stylization and ornamentation. He leaves the authentic elements inherent in the folk song style \u2014 unusual musical dimensions, free-floating accents, archaic words, but at the same time boldly reshapes melodies, treating the ancient song as his own, or, overcome by compositional ambitions and inspired by the studio experiments of the Beatles and George Martin, inserts quotes from Bach, Stravinsky and \"Farewell of Slavianka\", references to Chaliapin, Lemeshev and musique concr\u00e8te.\nMeduza magazine included the song \"Tanya Belaya\" in the list of 13 important songs performed by Gradsky.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAlexander Gradsky \u2013 vocals, synthesizer, guitar, piano, celesta, drums, bells, percussion\nYuri Ivanov \u2013 bass guitar, harmonica\nVladimir Vasilkov \u2013 percussion\nSergey Zenko \u2013 flute, pipe, saxophone\nSkoromorokhi \u2013 backing band\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\nReferences\n^ \"\u0421\u044e\u0438\u0442\u0430 \"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\"\".

    "Cemetery in Laceby, Lincolnshire, England\nLaceby War Memorial in Laceby Cemetery in 2024\nLaceby Cemetery is the burial ground for the village of Laceby in Lincolnshire. Owned and maintained by Laceby Parish Council, it is notable for the Grade II listed Haagensen Memorial and Vault in its grounds which was erected in 1897.\nHistory\nLaceby Cemetery opened in July 1875, presumably when the churchyard of the parish church, St Margaret's, became full. The cemetery is made up of several acres of former farmland purchased by the Village Council. As each field filled with burials the council would buy more farmland for use as a cemetery. These fields were then divided into Sections, and, as of 2024, there are 12 Sections in the Laceby Cemetery together with two sections known as the Gardens of Remembrance for the burial of cremated remains.\nWar Memorials\nThe grave of Sapper Arthur Lyne Hewitt RE in Laceby Cemetery\nAt the entrance to the cemetery can be found the Laceby War Memorial, a granite cross commemorating the men of the village who died in the two World Wars.\nAlso in the cemetery can be found the graves of four military personnel, three from World War I and one from World War II, with their distinctive Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) headstones. These are:\n1530 Driver Fred Plaskitt, 1st North Midland Bde., Royal Field Artillery, who died on 22 May 1915, aged 29\n72638 Sapper Arthur Lyne Hewitt, F.S. Signal Depot, Royal Engineers, who died on 5 November 1915, aged 29\n12659 Private R W Twidale, 7th Bn. Lincolnshire Regiment, who died on 28 April 1916, aged 20\nLT/JX 222462 Seaman RNPS George Perring, HMS Killingholme, who died on 2 October 1945, aged 49.\nThe grave of Sqn Ldr G. A. Butler in Laceby Cemetery\nHere too are buried the ashes of Squadron Leader George Alexander Butler, DSO, DFC, together with those of his wife Betty Joan Butler. Butler served with the RAF during World War II as a pilot with 139 Sqdn, No 2 Group, Bomber Command, RAF in the UK (1941-1942); with 60 Sqdn, Air Forces in India, RAF in India, 1942-1944; and who later commanded 11 Sqdn, No 902 Wing, Headquarters Royal Air Force Bengal and Burma, RAF in Burma, (1944-1945).\nHaagensen Memorial and Vault\nThe File:Haagensen Memorial and Vault in the cemetery\nThe Haagensen Memorial with its subterranean vault was erected in 1897. The memorial has been Grade II listed since 2015. The statue, carved from a single block of white Carrara marble, depicts Janna Eleanora Andrea Haagensen, the wife of  Peter Haagensen, the Consul for Sweden and Norway in Grimsby, and their four children. Janna Haagensen is shown being guided towards heaven by an angel while her four young children emerge from two tree stumps and reach up to her imploringly. Janna looks down at her children while her raised right arm has turned into a branch of a tree; her left is held by the angel. The epitaph is carved in relief and reads:\nIN MEMORY OF \nCONSUL PETER HENRIK HAAGENSEN \nBORN AT MOSS NORWAY 3RD AUGUST 1837 \nDIED AT BOURNMOUTH MAY 12TH 1919 \nAND OF HIS BELOVED WIFE \nJANNA \nBORN AT VINGER NORWAY 7TH SEPT 1845 \nDIED AT GRIMSBY 11TH DECR 1897 \nTO THE GLORY OF GOD \nIN THE \nHOPE OF RESURRECTION AND RECOGNITION IN ETERNITY.\nThe citation for the Grade II listing states:\nArchitectural and Sculptural quality: the striking design and aesthetic quality of the statue achieves a high level of sculptural quality, which is echoed in the design and artistic quality of the marble-lined vault with its relief depictions of Peter and Janna Haagensen.\nThe Haagensen Memorial in 2024\nIt is thought that Peter Haagensen had originally intended to build a vault at Grimsby Cemetery, but this had been refused, so instead he built his marble-lined family vault at nearby Laceby Cemetery. On the death and internment in the vault of his wife Janna Haagensen in 1897 he had the marble memorial statue erected above it. Peter Haagensen joined his wife on his own death in 1919 after a service held in Norwegian. The memorial's original inscription has been altered at some time, as old picture postcards reveal that the inscription had included the names of their four children: Henry (1875\u20131943), Clara Lina Andrea (1876\u20131963), the artist Frederick Hans (1878\u20131943), and Margit Maud Haagensen (1882\u20131970). This has been removed and the place of Peter's death added in its place.\nView of the statuary on the Haagensen Memorial\nSuch was the fame of the memorial that during the first half of the 20th century it regularly received numerous day trippers arriving by coach from Cleethorpes. The numbers of visitors were sufficient to support the nearby  Laceby Tearooms and the memorial appeared on numerous picture postcards and was reproduced in glazed Goss pottery replicas.\nThe marble lined vault with its segmented arched roof is accessed by steps under twelve cast-iron hinged and padlocked flaps. Its plain mosaic floor has a coloured border of mosaic flowers. The vault's northern wall has a carved portrait in relief o",

After improvising on the set of a car commercial, he took an improv class in England and then tried improv comedy, including at the Vancouver TheatreSports League and the Upright Citizens Brigade in New York.\nHe moved back to Vancouver and started performing stand-up, giving up on improv.

    "\nThe church, in 2010\nSt Philip and St James' Church is a parish church in Clifton, a suburb of inner northern York, in England.\nUntil the mid-19th century, Clifton fell mostly within the parish of St Olave's Church, and also a detached part of the parish of St Michael le Belfrey.  The heirs of Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey donated a site by Clifton Green for the construction of a church.  It was designed by George Fowler Jones, and was completed in 1867, at a cost of \u00a33,800.  It was given its own parish in 1871.\nThe church celebrated its centenary in 1967 by commissioning Kenneth Leighton to write a hymn, \"O God, enfold me in the sun\".  Between 1984 and 1989, the church was reordered by Ronald Sims, who replaced the pews with chairs, and converted the chancel and transepts into meeting rooms.  The building was grade II listed in 1997. Nikolaus Pevsner was critical of the design, describing a \"ponderous west tower\", but praised the \"excellent fittings in a plainer Pace style\".\nThe church is in the Early English style, and is built of stone, with slate roofs, topped by a stone cross and finials.  It comprises a five-bay nave, a two-bay chancel, north and south transepts, a west tower, and a south porch.  On the north side is a half-hexagonal staircase turret, and a vestry.  Most of the windows are lancets, some in groups of three, while the west window has a trefoil head. and many of the bays are divided by buttresses.  The main entrance is on the north side and has 20th-century double doors.  Inside there is a hammerbeam roof, with carved and gilded angels attached to the westernmost bay.  The window in the north transept has stained glass by Clayton and Bell, while the east window of the south transept is by John Ward Knowles, and other windows have plain glass designed by Sims.\nReferences\n^ Tillott, P.

    "Neova (formerly Vapo Oy) is the major peat producer in Finland. In 1984, Vapo was 100% owned by Finnish state. From 2002 to 2005, the Finnforest part of Mets\u00e4 Group owned 33% of Vapo. This share was expanded to and 49.9% between 2005 and 2009. In 2009 ownership of Vapo was reconstructed to Suomen Energiavarat Oy, owned by EPV Energy (previously Etel\u00e4-Pohjanmaan Voima Oy) and several peat energy using companies. In June 2009 Mets\u00e4liitto (Finnforest) sold its share to Suomen Energiavarat Oy. In 2012 those responsible include several municipal energy companies e.g. Helsinki, Vantaa, Oulu, Rauma, Sein\u00e4joki, Vaasa and Lahti.\nIn 2010, Vapo came under media attention after it made an official complaint about one of the officials handling some of its more than 100 applications to new peat collection areas. The official, environmental counsellor Antti Ylitalo, had written public appeals to protect endangered natural bogs (moss, moor). Vapo made a disqualification appeal against Ylitalo claiming that his statements formed a conflict of interests in the official evaluations of Vapo's applications. Ylitalo felt that the disqualification appeal by Vapo infringed his freedom of speech.\nAccording to VTT, in 2005 the major producers in Finland were Vapo Oy (78%) sek\u00e4 Turveruukki Oy (10%) followed by Fortum Power and Heat, Kuopion Energia, Alholmens Kraft and Vaskiluodon Voima.\nSuo Oy, a subsidiary of Vapo, cultivates reed canary grass in areas no longer used to produce peat. In 2010, it owned 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres) of agricultural land and received \u20ac673 000 in agricultural subsidies, the fifth largest agricultural subsidy in Finland at the time. In 2012, it was reported that Suo Oy had received in total some \u20ac10 million public financing over ten years for the reed canary grass cultivation. The reed, however, was viewed as a \"flop\", as it reportedly clogged equipment and remained at best equivalently priced to other products. As a result, most producers had quit.\nReferences\n^ \"Vapon vuosikymmenet\"  (in Finnish). Vapo.

    "The journal Starkad, 1899.\nStarkad Ski Club was a ski club and literary society during the early days of skiing in Norway. It was established in 1897 by \"three hopeful youths around 15 years old,\" friends George Wegner Paus, Thomas Schram, and Thoralf Ridder. The club had a dual purpose: it was both a ski club and a promoter of \"spiritual sport.\" The club is particularly remembered for its elaborate journal, titled Starkad, which was published between 1898 and 1903. It featured reports, interviews, poems, plays, and drawings from the early days of skiing in Norway, often with a humorous touch and high quality. The journal is considered an important source for the early history of skiing in Norway. Starkad's history is chronicled in the book Vinterlivets rene gl\u00e6der (The Joy of Winter Life), named after a 1901 poem by George Paus published in Starkad. Several members became notable in Norwegian sports. George Paus was also known as a mountaineer. Thorvald Heyerdahl became \"one of the most important Norwegian ski ambassadors abroad\"; Oscar Hammerstad led the ski team at the first Winter Olympics in Chamonix in 1924.\nHistory\nStarkad Ski Club, 1914\nStarkad is \"among the oldest ski clubs in the Oslo area and became part of a thriving ski community before 1900.\" The club emerged at a time when skiing, and the concepts of \"sport\" and \"club,\" were new in Norway. It never became large, but it had historical and cultural significance for the development of skiing.\nThe founders were friends George Wegner Paus, Thomas Schram and Thoralf Ridder. Paus described the founding as follows:\nOn Sunday, November 14, 1897, three hopeful youths around 15 years old walked down the path from \u00d8vre Frogners\u00e6ter to Voksenkollen. The largest, Thoralf, distinguished himself by a strong rotundity in the posterior region; the second, Thomas, had large, round eyes and delightful chubby cheeks; the smallest, George, was a little fiery fellow with hands in his pockets and an upturned nose. They all chattered eagerly and gesticulated with arms and legs, discussing the great problem: the founding of a ski club\u2014\u200aVinterlivets rene gl\u00e6der\nA few days after the founding, the club held a general assembly in the top floor of Paus's home at (Old) Nissen\u2019s Girls\u2019 School, and Alf J\u00f8rgensen, Bjarne Wold, Fredrik Parr, and Hans and Niels Hertzberg joined the association. George Paus was elected chairman and Thomas Schram vice chairman. The club was named \"SIF.\" However, \"some malicious individuals began to read the club's name backward  and name the members accordingly,\" so the name was changed to Starkad, a somewhat ambiguous hero and poet from Norse mythology. In the fall of 1898, Robert Schirmer, Sigurd Orre, Thorvald Heyerdahl, Gunnar Frost, and Kristian Norby became members. Most of the members lived within 600 meters east of the Royal Palace. Thorvald Heyerdahl played a significant role in bringing skiing and Norwegian ski techniques to Europe through his participation in European sports events, becoming \"one of the most important Norwegian ski ambassadors abroad.\" In 1900, the later well-known sports leader Oscar Hammerstad and lawyer brothers Enevold Falsen Schr\u00f8der and Johannes Schr\u00f8der joined; Hammerstad became secretary of the Norwegian Sports Federation, a colonel in the army, and led the ski team representing Norway at the first Winter Olympics in Chamonix in 1924. Eilert Sundt was also part of the club's milieu. George Wegner Paus's brother, surgeon Nikolai Nissen Paus, was also a member. In 1935, physician Lars Gram \u2013 both son-in-law of George Paus and nephew of Thomas Schram, two of the three founders \u2013 was admitted as a member.\nStarkad, 1902\nStarkad was initially based at Gr\u00f8ttum in S\u00f8rkedalen. In 1903, the club purchased a plot at Risfjellkastet in B\u00e6rum and built its own cabin, Starkadhytta. During World War II, Starkadhytta was used by Milorg, the anti-Nazi resistance movement. Under andre verdenskrig ble Starkadhytta brukt av Milorg.\nThe journal Starkad (1898\u20131903)\nThe magazine or newspaper Starkad (or Starkadavisen) fills three volumes and was published between 1898 and 1903. The magazine, a type of literary journal, contained reports, interviews, poems, plays (often with members in the roles), and drawings from sports events in Norway and the continent, as well as the social life around the club and its members, often of a humorous or romantic nature. Many texts and especially drawings by later architect Thoralf Ridder were of high quality, and the newspaper is regarded as an important historical source from the early days of skiing. The editors were elected at the general meeting, and the newspaper was regularly published as a handwritten and illustrated report circulated among members. For the five-year anniversary in 1902, the club published a commemorative booklet, Veslefandens jubileumsskrift, written by George Paus.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k J\u00f8rgensen, Ivar (2012).

    "\nHanlan's Point Amusement Park  was an attraction on Hanlan's Point on the Toronto Islands that operated from the 1880s until the 1930s and was regarded as \"Canada's answer to Coney Island\".\nHistory\nHanlan's Point is the most westerly of the Toronto Islands. Originally a cottage community, one of the first settlers there were was John Hanlan, after whom the island is named, and his family in 1862. In 1878, the Hanlan family converted their cottage into a hotel, and then replaced it with a new, larger 25-room Hanlan's Hotel in 1880, and began to develop the island as a tourist attraction. The Hanlan's Point Amusement Park was one of a series of attractions built by the Hanlans in the 1880s. In 1892, Ned Hanlan sold the amusement park, hotel, and other amenities to the Toronto Ferry Company which operated all the ferries travelling between the islands and the mainland, providing the only means for the general public to travel to the island.\nIn its heyday the amusement park was one of Toronto's major attractions and included a roller coaster, a miniature train, midway, grandstand, a vaudeville theatre, dancing pavilion, shooting gallery, tea garden and various rides and games. It is best remembered for having a 40 foot high platform from which diving horses would leap into Lake Ontario. Hanlan's Point Stadium was built next to the amusement park and was the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team, both of which were also owned by the ferry company.\nA fire on August 10, 1909, destroyed the hotel, the wooden stadium and all but five concession stands of the amusement park and did $200,000 in damage. The amusement park and a stadium, now made of concrete, were rebuilt in time for the 1910 season.\nThe park started to decline in the 1920s due to competition from the Sunnyside Amusement Park which opened on the mainland in 1922 and was accessible by automobile and streetcar, making it easier to access than Hanlan's Point which could only be reached by ferry. Attendance declined further in 1926 when the Maple Leafs baseball team moved from Hanlan's Point Stadium to Maple Leaf Stadium at the foot of Bathurst Street. In 1927, Lol Solman sold the Toronto Ferry Company, which owned the ferry service to the island as well as the amusement park, the stadium, and other amenities, to the City of Toronto with the Toronto Transportation Commission assuming operation of the ferries and the amusement park. The park was demolished in 1937 in order to make way for the Toronto Island airport. Today, the portion of Hanlan's Point which is not occupied by the airport remains a public recreation area consisting of Hanlan's Point Beach, a baseball diamond, bicycle and hiking trails, a tennis court, a volleyball court, picnic areas, fire pits and parkland as well as the Gibraltar Point Lighthouse.\nSee also\nHanlan's Point Beach\nCentreville Amusement Park - a smaller amusement park on the Toronto Islands which replaced Hanlan's Point\nScarboro Beach Amusement Park - a competing amusement park operating in the east end of Toronto in the same period\nReferences\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Hanlan's Point Amusement Park.\n^ Barbour, Dale (1 October 2021).

    "American socialite and First Lady of Illinois (1845\u20131928)\nEmma Susan Gillett Oglesby (February 11, 1845 \u2013 January 14, 1928) was an American social leader, anti-suffragist activist, and the wife of Illinois Governor Richard J. Oglesby.\nAs the First Lady of Illinois, Oglesby was a prominent figure in state and national social circles, known for her extensive hospitality and involvement in various civic activities, including the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. \nShe was also a vocal opponent of women's suffrage, serving as the 2nd vice-president of the Illinois Association Opposed to the Extension of Suffrage to Women. Oglesby married twice and had eight children.\nBiography\nEarly life\nEmma Susan Gillett was born on February 11, 1845, in Cornland, Illinois. She was the daughter of John Dean Gillett (1819\u20131888), a prominent cattle baron, and Lemira Parke Gillett (1821\u20131901).\nShe received a well-rounded education. Until the age of sixteen, she attended public schools. Her father then arranged for her to be tutored by his cousin, a scholar of the classics, who guided her through a rigorous course of reading that included works by Shakespeare, Plutarch, Rollin, Gibbon, Guizot, Motley, Bancroft, and others. This early exposure to classical literature fostered a lifelong love of reading.\nLater life\nShe married Governor Richard J. Oglesby, and the couple lived in Washington, D.C., during his terms as governor and U.S. senator before returning to Illinois in 1884.\nAs the state's First Lady, Oglesby was a prominent figure both in Illinois and nationally. She was a social leader, a board director for the World's Columbian Exposition, and gained further recognition through her international travels.\nShe was renowned for her extensive hospitality at Oglehurst, the family estate near Elkhart, particularly her annual Christmas dinners for the estate's tenants. The estate was also known for its impressive collection of artworks from around the world and for hosting numerous high-profile guests.\nOglesby actively participated in social and state activities, including serving on the National Woman's Committee for the 1893 World's Fair.\nAnti-suffragist activism\nIn 1897, Caroline Fairfield Corbin, a Chicago homemaker, founded the Illinois Association Opposed to the Extension of Suffrage to Women (IAOESW). Her organization contended that women should remain in their traditional domestic roles, allowing men to legislate on their behalf.\nOn April 1, 1898, Oglesby attended an IAOESW meeting at her former residence at Decatur, alongside Corbin. The residence is now owned by Mary Elizabeth (Morrison) Bering. Corbin argued against women's suffrage, asserting that men were uniquely suited to fight for freedom and that women, when protected from temptations, had not proven morally superior. She believed women's involvement in politics would lead to increased immorality and intrigue.\nEmma Oglesby served as the 2nd vice-president of the organization. In April 1909, they sent a broadside to the Illinois General Assembly.\nMarriage and children\nEmma married Hiram David Keays of Bloomington, Illinois, and birthed Hiram Gillett Keays. Her husband he died in 1868.\nIn November 1873, she married Governor Richard J. Oglesby at her father's house in Elkhart, Illinois. Their seven children included: John Gillett Oglesby, Richard James Oglesby Jr., Jasper Oglesby, Felicite Oglesby (later known as Felicite Oglesby Cenci Bolognetti), Olive Oglesby, Robert Oglesby, Emma Oglesby.\nShe had a total of eight children from the combined marriages.\nDeath and legacy\nGillette Memorial Arch\nThe John P. Gillett Memorial Bridge, originally a wooden structure built in 1899, was part of the Oglesby estate and was used for Governor Oglesby's funeral procession, which included Robert Lincoln.\nIn 1915, Emma Gillett Oglesby commissioned the replacement of the wooden bridge with a concrete one in 1915 to honor her brother, John P. Gillett. The bridge connects to Elkhart Cemetery through Gillette Memorial Arch on County Road 10.\nPersonality\nAccording to the The Decatur Daily Review, her charm, beauty, dignity it is said it remained notable throughout her life. She is described as the best-looking woman to have occupied the executive mansion at Springfield.\nDeath\nIn her later years, having outlived most of her friends, she turned to books for companionship. Despite being over eighty, she remained as witty and mentally active as she had been in her younger days.\nAround 1926, Oglesby suffered a stroke, which left her an invalid. She died on January 14, 1928, at her family estate after a prolonged illness.\nHer funeral services were held at St. John's Memorial Chapel, with Rev. Edward Haughton of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Springfield officiating. The family requested no flowers. She was interred in the mausoleum at Elkhart Cemetery. She leaves behind relatives that included her sister, Mrs. William Barnes, and her niece, Isabelle P. Vennigerholz. Her children were present at",

    "Lebanese militant leader\nTalal Hamieh (Arabic: \u0637\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u062d\u0645\u064a\u0629) is a Lebanese militant leader. A senior military commander in Hezbollah since its founding in the early 1980s, he is associated with terrorist attacks such as the 1994 AMIA bombing and 1996 Khobar Towers bombing. In 2017, the U.S. added Hamieh to its Rewards for Justice Program, offering $7 million for information leading to his arrest.\nBiography\nTalal Hussein Hamieh was born in the 1970s in Brital in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate near the Bekka Valley. He joined Hezbollah in the early 1980s, shortly after the arrival of Iranian trainers to the region. After the assassination of Abbas al-Musawi, Hamieh became a close associate of Imad Mughniyah. He became known to intelligence officials after he was caught on an intercepted communication celebrating the AMIA bombing, in which 85 people were killed, in Argentina. For many years he was Jihad's deputy, directing the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, in which 19 U.S. soldiers were killed, and attacks against the IDF during the Second Lebanon War.\nHe is a veteran figure in Hezbollah's foreign military operations, working alongside Hezbollah military commanders Mustafa Badreddine and Imad Mughniyeh and IRGC commander Ahmad Vahidi. Following Mughniyeh's death in 2008, Hamieh replaced him as Hezbollah's Chief of Staff, and he joined the Jihad Council alongside his responsibilities leading Hezbollah's foreign operations arm the External Security Organization (Unit 910).\nAfter Badreddine was indicted by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon for charges related to the assassination of Rafic Hariri in 2011, Hamieh reportedly assumed command of Hezbollah's military operations. Following Badreddine's death in 2011, Hamieh was considered a \"rising star\" in Hezbollah and someone likely to promoted to a more senior role in the organization. His photo was publicly revealed for the first time in 2016.\nDesignations\nHamiyah was designated a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the US Treasury Department on 13 September 2012 due to his alleged role as top military commander. He was designated alongside Badreddine. The basis for their designation was E.O. 13224 for providing support to Hezbollah's terrorist activities in the Middle East and around the world.\nThe U.S. State Department added him to its Rewards for Justice Program (RFJ) on October 10, 2017, offering $7 million for information leading to his arrest.

    "2022 video game\n2022 video game\nPoinpy is a vertically scrolling roguelike platform video game developed by Ojiro Fumoto (also known as Moppin) and published by Devolver Digital. It was released on June 10, 2022 on iOS and Android devices, exclusively though Netflix Games. The game received positive reviews from critics upon its release, with praise being given towards the gameplay and visuals.\nGameplay\nPoinpy stars the title character, a green dinosaur named Poinpy, ascending though various environments and collecting fruits in order to escape a giant blue creature. Poinpy is controlled though the use of the touchscreen, where holding down initiates a jump and allows the player to control its trajectory, and letting go causes him to jump, which can also work in midair. The number of jumps which Poinpy is allowed to initiate is determined by the number of jump orbs he currently has access to. If no jump orbs are present, Poinpy must land before he is allowed to jump again. Landing on the ground recharges all of his jump orbs, and jumping on an enemy or a pot recharges a single jump orb.\nVarious fruits are scattered throughout each of the worlds. These fruits must be collecting to produce juice in order to feed the creature chasing after Poinpy. The specific list of fruits that the creature wants are indicated though a thought bubble located on the top of the screen, which also indicates how much time is left to collect them. Failing to collect all the fruits before the time runs out will cause the creature to spit fire at Poinpy, costing him to lose a life point.\nThere are many level themes present in the game, ranging from jungles to underwater areas. Each theme also contains gimmicks to diversify the gameplay and increase your upwards momentum. The game's levels are created through procedural generation, with death sending the player back to the start of the level.\nTo alleviate the difficulty, permanent upgrades can be unlocked, which can enhance Poinpy's abilities. The fruit collected in levels counts towards a ranking system, allowing you to unlock extra jump orbs, seeds (which can also be obtained by beating puzzle levels and collecting fruit), and accessory slots. Additionally, the seeds which have been collecting can be used in a slot machine to purchase accessories, which grant Poinpy certain abilities such as attracting fruit or jumping higher.\nCompleting the main story campaign unlocks an endless mode.\nDevelopment\nPoinpy was developed by Ojiro Fumoto, as a part of Netflix's partnership with Devolver Digital. Development was a collaboration between Fumoto and Error403 (a Japanese illustrator). Fumoto handled the game design and programming, and Error403 created the artwork and animations. The design of Poinpy was in a part a response to Fumoto's previous game, Downwell. Fumoto believed that the high level of difficulty in Downwell blocked off many players from discovering the combo mechanic that he found most fun, so Poinpy was made more accessible in terms of difficulty and controls. Still, when fellow game designer and Poinpy playtester Derek Yu breezed through the game in a weekend, it caused some concern that the game was too easy.\nThe soundtrack was composed by Calum Bowen.\nReception\nReception\nPoinpy was positively received by critics, scoring 87/100 on reviews aggregation website Metacritic based on 7 reviews. Shaun Musgrave's review on TouchArcade called the game \"compelling and challenging, simple to pick up but with satisfying depth\" and made many comparisons to Downwell. Ana Diaz of Polygon described the game as \"delirious and smooth as hell.\" and that \"Despite being free...Poinpy is as compelling as some of the best paid mobile games out there.\" GameSpot's Kyle Hilliard rated the game highly, but criticized the soundtrack for being \"more annoying than charming\" and for the lack of a high score system.\nReferences\n^ a b c Hilliard, Kyle (July 18, 2022). \"Poinpy Review - Moving On Up\".

    "\nAmmar Ghalib (Arabic: \u0639\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u063a\u0627\u0644\u0628) is an Iraqi professional footballer who plays as a forward for Al-Shorta in the Iraq Stars League.\nClub career\nGhalib was promoted to Al-Shorta's first team in the summer of 2020 having come through the youth ranks at the club. He made his debut for the club in November 2020 against Al-Khalis in the Iraq FA Cup, coming off the bench in a 5\u20130 win. In January 2021, Ammar made his league debut for the club, coming on against Al-Hudood in the Iraqi Premier League. He would play in his first Baghdad Derby in June 2021 in a loss against Al-Zawraa. In June 2023 Ammar scored in Al-Shorta's 5\u20130 win away at Al-Najaf which helped them keep their spot at the top of the table. The defending champions would win the league for a second season in a row in July, giving the young forward the second Iraqi Premier League medal of his career. The following week he was part of the Al-Shorta squad that travelled to Saudi Arabia for the 2023 Arab Club Champions Cup where they would reach the semi-final, being the only club in the final four from outside the Saudi Pro League.\nIn September 2023, Al-Naft signed the young forward on loan for the upcoming season. In March 2024, Ghalib scored for Al-Naft in an important 3\u20132 victory over Al-Qasim in the Iraq Stars League.\nInternational career\nAmmar received his first call up to the Iraq U-23 national team in August 2021 in a friendly defeat against Libya during the team's training camp in Turkey. He kept his place in the squad in September 2021 for two friendlies against UAE U-23 in Fujairah. In October, Ghalib was called up to the U-23 national team again for the 2021 WAFF U-23 Championship in Saudi Arabia, which Iraq would reach the semi-finals of. He would remain in the squad for the 2022 AFC U-23 Asian Cup qualifiers later that month, where he helped his country qualify. Ammar was part of the squad at the 2022 Dubai International Tournament in March where he scored one goal against Saudi Arabia. In March 2023, Ghalib was recalled to the U-23 national team for the Doha International U-23 Cup. He stayed with the squad that travelled to Kuwait in September for the 2024 AFC U-23 Asian Cup qualifiers, which they would qualify for.\nHonours\nAl-Shorta\nIraqi Premier League: 2021\u201322, 2022\u201323\nIraq U-23\nWAFF U-23 Championship: 2023\nReferences\n^ \"\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u064a\u062a\u063a\u0644\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0637\u0629 \u0648\u064a\u0636\u0639 \u0642\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0646\u0635\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062a\u0648\u064a\u062c\" (in Arabic).

    "New Zealand mayor\nLily Annie Huggan MBE (10 March 1890\u20134 May 1983) was an English-born New Zealand politician.\nBiography\nEarly life and career\nHuggan was born at Halifax in 1890 to cabinet maker John Henry Brown and his wife Rebecca Grundy Morton. She received her education in Brighouse and later Huddersfield. She spent 20 years working in local textile mills after leaving school. Eventually becoming a percher, a textile worker who inspects cloth, heading the mill's finishing department. The son of her boss asked her to marry him, however the proposal came too late as she had already planned to emigrate overseas, having been persuaded to do so by her father's uncle who lived in Auckland.\nIn December 1922 Huggan emigrated to New Zealand along with her parents and an older brother, settling in Wellington. Soon after arriving she met Joseph Mitchell Huggan and on 14 July 1923 the two married at St Hilda's Church, Upper Hutt. No children came from the marriage. In 1924 her family moved from Upper Hutt to Korokoro, where she worked at a woollen mill. In 1932 she and her husband began to run the Korokoro general store, initially located in the front room of their house. The store would later additionally host a post office and Huggan also established a business where she did invisible garment mending. Her father-in-law and mother-in-law came to live with them so they purchased a 4\u00bd acre section behind their store in 1933 to build her in-law's their own dwelling. During the Great Depression the Huggan's worked with the unemployed as part of the local relief committee. She supplied home-made morning and afternoon teas and lunches to relief workers. Huggan and her husband became known the uncrowned 'mayor and mayoress of Korokoro' for their efforts. She was secretary of the Korokoro Progressive Association from 1935 until the 1950s. The association organised summer carnivals and she taught girls at the local school in maypole dancing.\nIn 1950 her husband was elected Mayor of Petone leading them to move from Korokoro to Cuba Street in Petone. There they lived with her elderly uncle, Bill. In a jovial gesture she was presented with a brooch in 1954 by her husband (as mayor) to compensate for the amount of time he had been late home from night meetings.\nPolitical career\nHer husband died suddenly of a brain hemorrhage on 6 September 1957 at Hutt Hospital. Before her husband had even been buried, the Petone Labour Party branch asked Annie to stand for the mayoralty. She was given five days to decide. She spoke to the Town Clerk, her minister, a bank manager, several friends and wrote to her sister-in-law in Hawke's Bay about it. She wondered if the offer was serious or if it had been made out of sympathy. After initially being likely to decline the offer she received a telegram from her sister-in-law which said \"It is what Joe would have liked\" which led Huggan to change her mind and accepted the offer. She was duly announced as the Labour Party's candidate for the mayoral by-election. However no other candidates came forward and she was elected unopposed. She was the Petone Borough Council's representative on the State Advances Corporation's Hutt Valley housing allocation committee and the Hutt Park committee. Same as her husband, she was fiercely opposed to the suggestion of amalgamation of Petone with the neighbouring city of Lower Hutt.\nIn 1964 the Petone Borough Council opened a long-planned refuse tip in the western hills. Controversially, it was adjacent to a scenic reserve which upset residents and environmentalists. Huggan and two other councillors were deselected by the Labour Party for the 1965 election. She stood as an independent, but lost to her replacement as Labour Party candidate Ralph Love.

His brother Antoni H\u0142uszniewicz was a doctor and \u00e9migr\u00e9 activist. Their father ran a private boys' school in the city. After graduating from a gymnasium in Minsk, H\u0142uszniewicz studied mathematics at Vilnius University from 1814 to 1818. He achieved his magister degree in philosophy in 1818. Among his teachers was Jan \u015aniadecki.\nIn 1819 he became an adjunct professor, and later assistant to Piotr S\u0142awinski, the director of the Vilnius University Astronomical Observatory. H\u0142uszniewicz succeeded S\u0142awinski as the observatory's director in 1843, holding the title until 1848. H\u0142uszniewicz participated in Carl Friedrich Tenner's triangulation of Lithuania and other surrounding areas for which he was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus with a ring. As an astronomer, H\u0142uszniewicz observed planets, occultation of the Moon, eclipses of Jupiter's moons, and asteroids. He also continued publishing the observatory's magazine (called Extrait des observations faites \u00e0 l\u2019observatoire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Imp\u00e9riale des Sciences \u00e0 Vilna), which was established during S\u0142awinski's time. Observations were also published in Astronomische Nachrichten.\nH\u0142uszniewicz lived modestly and gave much of his wealth to the poor. He belonged to the Society for the Support of Poor University Students. He kept about a tenth of his pension for himself and gave the rest to poor widows and orphans.\nH\u0142uszniewicz died on 21 July 1862 in Vilnius. He was buried near the city's Church of St. Stephen.\nReferences\n^ a b c Dziewulski, W\u0142adys\u0142aw (1937). Micha\u0142 H\u0142uszniewicz (1797 \u2013 1862).

She made her wrestling debut in 1958. On October 21, 1963, Brown made history when she defeated Nell Stewart for the NWA Texas Women's Championship becoming the first black woman to win a title in wrestling history. During her career she wrestled in Florida, Calgary, Mid-Atlantic, Alabama and Hawaii. She retired from wrestling in 1972. \nDeath\nBrown passed away from breast cancer at 50 on July 25, 1989.\nLegacy\nIn 2019, she was featured on Vice's Dark Side of the Ring episode on the Fabulous Moolah. Her son, Michael mentions his mother's life and the abuse she suffered in wrestling.\nOne of the most notorious accusations is from the family of Sweet Georgia Brown (Susie Mae McCoy), who was trained by Moolah and her husband, Buddy Lee. The Columbia Free Times reported allegations made by her daughter in 2006, in which she said her mother told her that she was often raped, given drugs, and made an addict in an intentional attempt by Ellison and Lee to control her.\nMichael McCoy, Sweet Georgia Brown's son, refuted allegations made by his sister, stating that she has an agenda and that the allegations are false. However, on the Dark Side of the Ring episode about The Fabulous Moolah, Michael McCoy stated that she was indeed made to have sex with paying promoters. Bruce Prichard said she was protecting herself from the promoters and the only negative thing he heard of her was \"took a percentage of their pay, which was laid out in their contract clearly before they even started training, day one.\"\nChampionships and accomplishments\nNational Wrestling Alliance\nNWA Texas Women's Championship (1 time)\nReferences\n^ \"Sweet Georgia Brown\".

    "2024 United States case on voting rights\nPetteway v. Galveston County 86 F.4th 1146 (5th Cir. 2023) is a United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit case in which the court held that racial and ethnic groups may not aggregate their populations in Voting Rights Act violation claims. The decision overrules the court's prior decision in Campos v. City of Baytown (1988). The case was decided en banc.\nBackground\nRedistricting in Galveston County\nFurther information: Redistricting in Texas\nAfter the 2020 United States census was received, Galveston County began redistricting efforts. Two redistricting maps were suggested regarding the county's third precinct; one proposal retained the precinct's majority minority status, while the other reduced the precinct's minority population to the lowest of the four precincts. The Commissioners' Court voted to enact the second map with Stephen Holmes, who represents the third precinct, dissenting.\nLower court history\nTerry Petteway, Derreck Rose, and Penny Pope filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Commissioners' Court's decision, with the NAACP and the Department of Justice filing separate lawsuits. The plaintiffs argued that the enacted proposal violated Section II of the Voting Rights Act by reducing the voter representation of Galveston County's African American and Hispanic population; furthermore, Petteway and the NAACP alleged that the redistricting violated the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments as intentionally discriminatory.\nThe District Court for the Southern District of Texas determined that the enacted proposal violated Section II, enjoining the country from using the proposal and adhering to Campos v. City of Baytown (1988). Galveston County appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\nU.S. Court of Appeals\nCircuit judge Edith Jones authored the majority opinion in Petteway v. Galveston County.\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit voted to rehear the case en banc and stayed the District Court for the Southern District of Texas's order. The Fifth Circuit heard arguments for Petteway v. Galveston County on May 14, 2024.\nOn August 1, 2024, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Voting Rights Act does not authorize racial and ethnic groups to aggregate their populations in vote dilution claims, overruling the court's decision in Campos v. City of Baytown (1988), citing the statutory text of Section II and precedent in cases such as Bartlett v. Strickland (2009). Edith Jones authored the majority, joined by eleven judges; chief judge Priscilla Richman did not join section II.D and James C. Ho joined sections I, II.C, and III only. Six judges dissented. The decision applies to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, and is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court.\nNotes\n^ Richman did not join section II.D.\n^ Ho joined sections I, II.C, and III only.\n^ In its ruling, the Fifth Circuit consolidated United States v. Galveston County and Dickinson Bay Area Branch NAACP v. Galveston County into Petteway v. Galveston County.\nReferences\nPrimary\n^ United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 2024, p.\u00a05\n^ United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 2024, p.\u00a05\n^ United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 2024, p.\u00a05-6\n^ United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 2024, p.\u00a06\n^ United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 2024, p.\u00a011\n^ United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 2024, p.\u00a02\nSecondary\n^ Schneider, Andrew (May 13, 2024). \"Galveston County voting rights case set to go before full 5th Circuit appellate court\".

It operated from 1926 to 1940, when it was forbidden by the Soviet authorities, and was restored in 1989.\nCaritas Lithuania is a member of both Caritas Europa and Caritas Internationalis. \nHistory\nLithuanian Caritas was established in 1926, bringing together nearly all Catholic educational and charitable organisations. It operated throughout the 1930s until the Soviets banned the organisation and all other Church activities following their occupation of Lithuania in 1940.\nIn 1988, an underground Catholic women's group named Caritas was formed in Kaunas, with the nun Albina Pajarskait\u0117 of the Convent of the Sisters of the Poor being one of the organisers. It was officially registered on 15 April 1989. The founding convention that took place in the Kaunas Sports Hall for two days and was attended by hundreds of representatives from women's group from all over the country and thousands of guests.\nIn 1991, following expanded operational opportunities, the \"Lithuanian Caritas Federation\" (Lietuvos Caritas federacija) was established during an extraordinary congress on June 2, adopting new statutes and the new name. Membership was opened to both men and women. The federation, uniting clergy and laity, aimed to educate society religiously and ethically while addressing social issues and promoting charitable activities. That same year, it became a member organisation of Caritas Internationalis.\nIn 1992, the Federation initiated the establishment of the Center for Professional Studies in Social Care at Vytautas Magnus University of Kaunas. The organisation's structure was slightly adjusted in July 1994 to encourage greater involvement of Catholic laypeople in charity work. A major reorganization occurred during the 1997 congress, fully integrating Caritas into the structure of the Lithuanian Catholic Church, operating from that point on under the Lithuanian Bishops' Conference. The name was also changed to \"Lithuanian Caritas\" (Lietuvos Caritas), with priest Robertas Grigas appointed as general director.\nAt its founding congress, Caritas outlined its long-term activity directions: human upbringing and education, alleviating suffering, and promoting spiritual values. Recognising the most pressing societal issues, Caritas established various initiatives to address them, including charity canteens, nursing homes for the elderly and children, family support centres, nursing hospitals, and a pharmacy.\nThe organisation offers a wide range of social, medical, and consulting services for socially disadvantaged individuals. It runs public canteens, pharmacies, and nursing, treatment, and care facilities. Since 2005, it has provided food to approximately 180,000 people in need. By 2020, its operations were supported by 250 employees and over 3,000 volunteers. With the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Caritas Lithuania become active in providing support to Ukrainian refugees arriving in Lithuania, and collecting funds for Caritas projects in Ukraine.\nStructure\nCaritas Lithuania consists of a national office and of seven regional, autonomous Caritas organisations in Lithuania. They implement social projects locally. The 7 local organisations are:\nCaritas Kai\u0161iadorys\nCaritas Kaunas\nCaritas Panev\u0117\u017eys\nCaritas \u0160iauliai\nCaritas Tel\u0161iai\nCaritas Vilkavi\u0161kis\nCaritas Vilnius\nReferences\n^ a b c d Robertas Grigas. \"Caritas\".

    "\nThe Safavid conquest of Bahrain was a military campaign launched in 1602 to capture the island of Bahrain from the Portuguese. The Safavids expelled the Portuguese ending their occupation of the island.\nIn 1521, the Portuguese invaded and captured the island of Bahrain. In 1601 the Persian general, Allahverdi Khan, conquered Lar, under quasi-autonomous governorship. This was after its governor behaved treacherously towards Allahverdi, forcing him to capture Lar. The Persians succeeded and its governor died during the siege. The capture of Lar allowed the Safavid Persians to control the coasts of the Persian Gulf, which brought them direct hostilities with the Portuguese in the Gulf.\nIn 1602, the governor of Bahrain, Rukn al-Din Mas'ud, who was the brother of the Hormuzi Vizier, declared independence from Hormuz. Fearing a retaliation from the Portuguese fort in Bahrain. Rukn al-Din asked his relative, Mu'in al-Din Fali, for help. The latter asked for help from Allahverdi. Allahverdi saw this as a great opportunity to seize Bahrain since the Safavids saw it as belonging to Fars province. He then dispatched a force of musketeers to help Rukn al-Din. The Persian forces successfully expelled the Portuguese from their fort, defeating it.\nRukn al-Din welcomed the Persians led by Allahverdi Khan, however; Allahverdi ordered Rukn al-Din to be executed, thus consolidating Safavid rule over Bahrain. The Safavids expected a Portuguese counterattack. The news of the fall reached Hormuz and a joint Portuguese-Hormuz materialized. Several engagements on land and sea during which Mu'in al-Din Fali was wounded and later died. The Safavids held out and emerged victorious. The Portuguese forces retreated.\nReferences\n^ Willem M Floor, p. 202\n^ Willem M Floor, p. 202\n^ Nasrallah al-Falsafi, p. 38\n^ Falih Handhal, p. 489\n^ Falih Handhal, p. 489\n^ Willem M Floor, p. 202\n^ Nasrallah al-Falsafi, p. 38-39\n^ Falih Handhal, p. 489\nSources\nWillem M Floor (2006), A political and economic history of five port cities, 1500-1730.\nNasrallah al-Falsafi (1989), Iran and its foreign relations in the Safavid era.\nFalih Handhal (1997), Arab and Portuguese in History from 711 to 1720.\n",
    "Spanish cinematographer\nDani Salo Aec Sanchez-Lopez, better known as Dani SaLo, is a Spanish cinematographer, director and actor based in Los Angeles.\nEarly life\nDani graduated from Dodge College of Film and Media Arts with an MFA in Film Production in 2009.\nAfter completing his studies, Dani went to work in Asia due to limited work opportunities in Los Angeles. He collaborate with fellow alumni, Ammar Rasool and Mian Adnan Ahmad.\nDani directed the music video Aik Tha Badshah for the Pakistani rock group Noori. The video was well-received and was a nominated for Best Music Video at the Hum Awards in 2015.\nCareer\nDani has worked San \u201875, Tamanchey, Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! and Dil Dhadakne Do.\nIn April 2017, Dani was invited by director Nag Ashwin to join the team of Mahanati, a biopic of the iconic South Indian actress Savitri. His approach to capture the golden era of Telugu and Tamil cinema was influenced from cinematographer Marcus Bartley's work on Mayabazar and others.\nOne of the aspects of his work on Mahanati was the decision to shoot parts of the film on super 16mm film stock to capture the essence of the 1980s. Dani's work on Mahanati was highly praised, including commendation from filmmaker Singeetham Srinivasa Rao.\nAfter Mahanati, Dani returned to Los Angeles to work on The MisEducation of Bindu.\nFollowing his collaboration with Nag Ashwin on Mahanati, Dani was initially brought on board for Ashwin's next project, Kalki 2898 AD. However, Dani was eventually replaced by Djordje Stojiljkovic.\nDani's work on Virata Parvam (2022) is influenced by filmmakers and photographers, drawing inspiration from Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s The Mirror, Stalker and the works of Janusz Kaminski and Emmanuel Lubezki. He has a particular disdain for shooting in studio environments, preferring the challenges of real locations, where he adapts to natural lighting conditions and the physical constraints of the environment.\nFilmography\nMusic videos\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f \"Alumni Spotlight: Dani S\u00e1nchez-L\u00f3pez\".

    "Basketball league\nSuper League Basketball (SLB) is a men's professional basketball league. Established in 2024, the competition replaces the former British Basketball League (BBL) as the top-level men's basketball competition in Great Britain.\nHistory\nFrom 1987, the British Basketball League (BBL) was the pre-eminent basketball competition in Great Britain. By 2024, Basketball League Ltd (BLL), the operating company behind the BBL, was in severe financial difficulties. Due to this uncertainty, the British Basketball Federation (BBF) terminated BLL's operating license to run the men's professional league, with immediate effect. On the same day a new organisation, Premier Basketball Limited, was formed by a consortium of existing basketball teams formerly of the BBL.

    "Species of stick insect\nObrimus bufo is a stick insect species from the family of the Heteropterygidae native to the Philippine island of Luzon.\nDescription\nObrimus bufo is the largest species of the genus. In this species, too, the slits in the metasternum that are typical of the genus are very narrow and barely recognizable. The females known to date reach lengths of between 10.6 to 10.9 centimetres (4.2 to 4.3\u00a0in). The coloration when alive is unknown. The coloration of the collection specimens varies between iron-, medium- and ochre-brown, with the ochre-brown specimen showing an olive-green shimmer. The body spines of the females are similar to those of the smaller and stockier Obrimus bicolanus. From these, Obrimus bufo females are distinguished by the presence of a pair of small but distinct anterior spines on the pronotum (anterior pronotals), the absence of a second, posterior pair of spines on the abdominal terga II to IV, as well as by a differently shaped preopercular organ, which has a transverse and slightly double-humped swelling on the posterior edge of the sternum VII of the abdomen.\nThe males reach a length of about 6.85 to 7.3 centimetres (2.70 to 2.87\u00a0in). They are as slender and spiny as those of Obrimus bicolanus, but differ from these in that their anal segment which is broadened transversely and more rectangular. Its posterior margin is broader, slightly bilobed and has a shallow pit near each posterior-lateral angle. The anal segment of the males of Obrimus bicolanus is, on the other hand, almost hexagonal.\nThe only known egg is 5.3 millimetres (0.21\u00a0in) long, 3.0 millimetres (0.12\u00a0in) wide and 3.8 millimetres (0.15\u00a0in) high, bulbous and of a typical shape for the genus. The capsule is slightly domed and shows the transverse indentation typical of Obrimus at the lower pole, which makes the eggs there appear double-humped. The dorsal surface is more convex than the ventral. The micropylar plate is 3.9 millimetres (0.15\u00a0in) long and wide, three-armed, inverted T-shaped. It is noticeably inflated and clearly raised above the capsule surface. The lid (operculum) is round, flat and sits on the capsule with an opercular angle of about 15\u00b0, which slopes slightly towards the ventral side. In Obrimus bicolanus this is larger and amounts to 25\u00b0.\nOccurrence\nIn the first description, only the Philippine islands are mentioned as locality of the described material. Later, the place of discovery is given as Manila and thus the island of Luzon. The more recent finds that can be definitely assigned to this species come from the province of Ilocos Norte or, somewhat less precisely, from the Ilocos Region and thus from the northwest of Luzon.\nDrawing from the original description by Westwood 1848\nDrawing of a female nymph from Westwood 1859\nTaxonomy\nJohn Obadiah Westwood described the species in 1848 as Phasma (Acanthoderus) bufo. The chosen species name \"bufo\" (Latin and borrowed there for the family of true toads (Bufonidae) or the genus (Bufo)) is not explained. Westwood depicts a female and describes in particular the spines. The description of the males is reduced to the statements that they are smaller and slimmer and have the same spines as the females. In 1859 he transferred the species, like many others, to the former subgenus Acanthoderus, which is now listed as a genus. Here, too, he describes the females and depicts an animal that he suspects to be a juvenile female, but does not rule out that it could also be a male. Whether this is the specimen to which the short description of the male appended in 1848 refers is not clear from the text. This is supported by the fact that among the four syntypes of the species there is also a juvenile female, which was sometimes referred to as a male until the 2020s.\nCarl St\u00e5l transferred the species in 1875 to the specially for it created genus Obrimus, making it its type species. Joseph Redtenbacher also worked on the species in 1906. He assigned Obrimus mesoplatus, known only from the male holotype, as a synonym of Obrimus bufo and obviously used its holotype to describe the morphology and size of the males. He mentions material from his collection that is said to come from Manila. This specimen from his collection is now in the Natural History Museum, Vienna and is characterized by slightly more pronounced spines. Redtenbacher's synonymization of Obrimus mesoplatus was revised again in 1939 by James Abram Garfield Rehn and his son John William Holman Rehn. They also pointed out that Redtenbacher's specimen from Manila could be either Obrimus bufo or Obrimus uichancoi they had newly described.\nOf the four syntypes of the species, one female is deposited at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. The two remaining adult females and the juvenile female are kept at the Natural History Museum. Frank H. Hennemann chose the Oxford female as the lectotype in 2023, as this is apparently the specimen from which Westwood had described the species in 18",
    "Genus of planthoppers\nDiostrombus is a large genus of planthoppers from the family Derbidae, tribe Zoraidini, with more than 40 species. The large majority of species have been described from Africa and the Near East. However, a few species, including the type species, are found in southern and eastern parts of Asia. In Africa, the distribution range of Diostrombus species extends from the humid tropics of western Africa to many parts of eastern Africa, as far north as parts of Sudan and as far south as South Africa. Three species have been described from Yemen and the Iran. Like other species of the tribe Zoraidini, species of Diostrombus have long and narrow forewings and short hind wings. The main characteristic of Diostrombus is the forewing venation with the media vein having 6 branches which do not split further into sub branches. The hind wings are much shorter than half the forewing length and have a pointed tip. In profile the head is usually flat, but in some African species, the ridges on the sides of the face are extended in front of the antennae. The face is narrow. The antennae are short compared to other genera of the tribe Zoraidini, about half as long as the face.\nType species: Diostrombus politus Uhler, 1896\nDistribution\nDistribution ranges of the species in the genus Diostrombus (blue outline) and that of Diostrombus politus, the type species (brown outline)\nMore than 80% of the species described in the genus Diostrombus are found in Africa, and the majority of these have been reported from the humid tropics of western Africa, from Guinea and Sierra Leone in the North to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the South. In eastern Africa the distribution of Diostrombus species ranges from parts of Sudan and Ethiopia in the North to parts of South Africa in the South. One species has been also described from Yemen (Diostrombus nike) and two from Iran (D. adila and D. jezeki). Further east in Asia, three more Diostrombus species are found, Diostrombus carnosa, D. pennatus and the type species, D. politus. The distribution of these eastern species ranges from eastern parts of India in the West, over Myanmar, parts of China, Taiwan, South Korea to southern parts of Japan in the East. It also includes parts of Indonesia in the South.\nDescription\nDiostrombus politus - Left: head in frontal and side view - Right: shape and venation of forewing (top) and hind wing (bottom), with the media and the first media branch marked. The hind wing has a pointed tip.\nLeft: Profile of Diostrombus atricollis - Right: Forewing and hind wing of Diostrombus hopkinsi\nSpecies of Diostrombus can be recognized by the venation of the forewings and the pointed tips of the hind wings. The media of the forewing has six branches, with none of them branching further into sub branches. The radius has 2 short sub branches near its tip and compared to other Zoraidini, there are 2 long and rather broad cells between the radius and the media. The hind wings are much shorter than half the forewing length and have a distinctive shape with a pointed tip near the frontal (costal) margin.\nThe face (frons) of Diostrombus species is narrow with the ridges on its sides running approximately parallel to each other. In side view, the head typically has a flat profile. However, in some African species like in Diostrombus atricollis, the ridges on the side of the face are extended in front of the antennae. Compared to other genera of Zoraidini, the antennae are short and cylindrical, only about half as long as the face. The terminal arista (bristle) is inserted below the tip of the antennae.\nDiostrombus politus from Japan\nMany Diostrombus species are coloured orange, red or yellow like the type species which is almost completely orange-red (see the illustration on the right). Other species are only partly orange or yellow and often also have parts which are black or dark brown. A few species are predominantly black. The forewings usually have a length of 7 to 9\u00a0 mm and the length of the body, from head to the tip of the abdomen, is around 4 or 5\u00a0mm. Like in other planthoppers of the tribe Zoraidini, the wings are raised and spread out when the insects are at rest.\nBiology\nThere is no information on the biology of the nymphal stages of Diostrombus species. However, it can be assumed that they live in decaying organic matter like other derbids, feeding on fungi. The adults prefer to feed on monocots like palm trees, maize or rice, like other members of the tribe Zoraidini. Some Asian species can be common enough to be listed occasionally as minor pests.\nDiostrombus species may be also vectors of plant diseases. In Mozambique, Diostrombus mkurangai was found to be one of the most common sap-sucking insects on coconut palms affected by the lethal yellowing disease and the causal phytoplasma agent was present in this species. In Ghana, a similar disease called Cape Saint Paul Wilt also affects coconut palms and Diostrombus species were again c",
    "Cuban army general\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Arango and the second or maternal family name is  Ag\u00fcero.\nNapole\u00f3n Arango was a Cuban plantation owner and mamb\u00ed officer who defected to the Spanish Army during the Ten Years' War.\nEarly life\nNapole\u00f3n Arango y Ag\u00fcero was born in Puerto Pr\u00edncipe (now Camag\u00fcey), Spanish Cuba in the 19th century. He was the sibling of Cuban Patriot Augusto Arango.\nArango owned the El Destino plantation near Las Minas in the province of Camag\u00fcey.\nTen Years' War\nIn the lead-up to Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes' Cry of Yara in Eastern Cuba, Arango expressed doubts about their readiness to overcome the Spanish troops and showed reluctance toward the idea of freeing his slaves. Despite his objections, Arango involved himself in the Ten Years' War, the first major Cuban campaign against Spanish rule.\nThe Camag\u00fcey Province of Central Cuba joined the insurrection upon the Las Clavellinas Uprising. With Napole\u00f3n and Augusto Arango at the head of a squad, they forced a Spanish garrison, consisting of a lieutenant and 30 cavalrymen, to surrender on November 4, 1868, at San Miguel de Bag\u00e1 near Nuevitas. Napole\u00f3n Arango, who tried to undermine the central department's efforts at a meeting at Las Clavellinas on November 18, was expelled from the ranks during a meeting in Las Minas on November 26, 1868. His counter-revolutionary proposals were opposed by the other leaders who voted to continue the armed fight against Spanish domination.\nAugusto's Death\nHis brother Augusto Arango sustained his leadership of the mambises in the Camag\u00fcey region. In January 1869, C\u00e9spedes's attempt to negotiate terms through his brother Augusto was thwarted when Augusto, holding a safe-conduct, was treacherously killed at the town gate, leading C\u00e9spedes to end all further negotiations with the Spanish authorities.\nIn April 1869, Napole\u00f3n Arango and others opposed the appointment of Manuel de Quesada as General-in-Chief of the Liberation Army.\nDefection\nSoon after, he made an attempt to betray the Cubans to the Spanish troops but was arrested, tried for treason, and sentenced to death. Given his family's influential status and his brother's sacrifice for the cause, his sentence was reduced, though he was banned from returning to Cuba under threat of execution. He defected to the Spanish Army and had been living under their protection.\nBy February 1870, it was reported that Gen. Arango voluntarily surrendered to the authorities at Las Minas and that he vowed to confer with the Captain General Antonio Caballero y Fern\u00e1ndez de Rodas on the best means of ending the insurrection without further bloodshed. Upon his surrender, he was placed in charge of the administration of goods confiscated from rebels in the province and persuaded to intervene with the island's peace negotiations. He pleaded with his former compatriots to surrender and follow his example. On March 28, 1870, Napoleon Arango published a manifesto titled The Cuban Rebellion, It's History, Government, Resources, Object, Hopes and Prospects: Address of General Napolean Arango to his Countrymen in Arms and stated his objections to the insurrection declared by Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes.\nReferences\n^ Sullivan,\u00a0P.\u00a0(2011).\u00a0Xuxub Must Die: The Lost Histories of a Murder on the Yucatan.\u00a0United States:\u00a0University of Pittsburgh Press.\n^ Sullivan,\u00a0P.\u00a0(2011).\u00a0Xuxub Must Die: The Lost Histories of a Murder on the Yucatan.\u00a0United States:\u00a0University of Pittsburgh Press.\n^ \"Revista | Cuban Genealogical Society\" (PDF). cubagenweb.org.

    "Iranian warship, commissioned 2022\nIRIS Shahid Soleimani (Persian: \u0634\u0647\u06cc\u062f \u0633\u0644\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc) is the lead ship of an Iranian class of missile corvettes with the same name. It was built by the Shahid Mahallati Shipyard and is operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy of Iran.\nDesign\nHull\nThe ship has a catamaran (twin hull) design with sharp angles to give it a more stealthy design. Its design has been compared to the Chinese Type 22 missile boat and the Taiwanese Tuo Chiang class. According to Iranian officials the ship's hull is made of aluminium instead of steel which decreases the weight and is a new innovation in the Iranian shipbuilding industry.\nArmament\nThis warship is equipped with six anti-ship cruise missiles including four long-range ones (likely Noor or Ghadir) and two short-range anti-ship missiles (likely Nasir) in an order of two long-range and one short-range box launchers on each side behind the superstructure. It is also the first Iranian warship to be equipped with a vertical launching system (VLS). Its VLS includes 6 bigger cells for surface-to-surface cruise missiles and 16 smaller ones for surface-to-air missiles all of which are located behind the command bridge. The warship Shahid Soleimani is also equipped with four 23 mm gatling guns (likely Asef), one 30 mm auto-canon and two chaff dispensers. According to Commodore Alireza Tangsiri, the Shahid Soleimani-class vessels have been equipped with different missiles with ranges of 200, 300 and 750 kilometers, as well as with a new 2,000-kilometer-range cruise missile named Ghadr-474. Tangsiri later said that Sayyad Shirazi and Hassan Baqeri are equipped with 16 Navvab vertically-launched missiles and 6 Sayyad-3 missiles.\nRadars and electronics\nIntelligence and reconnaissance monitoring, surface and subsurface and air traffic monitoring are among the duties of this vessel and it is equipped with Iran's most advanced electronic warfare systems.\nPropulsion\nShahid Soleimani is powered by four indigenous diesel engines which gives it a top speed of 32 knots (59\u00a0km/h; 37\u00a0mph) and a range of 5,000 nautical miles (9,300\u00a0km; 5,800\u00a0mi).\nOther equipment\nThe warship also has a helipad and a crane under it which is used to launch and retrieve fast attack boats. The ship can carry three fast attack boats and has the ability to retrieve and rearm them.\nHistory\nAfter the end of construction at the Shahid Mahallati Shipyard on 14 June 2022, it underwent sea trials but at that time instead of four 20 mm gatling guns, it was equipped with four 12.7 mm machine guns which were later replaced. On 5 September 2022, Shahid Soleimani was commissioned into IRGC's navy branch in a commissioning ceremony.\nSee also\nIRIS\u00a0Shahid Nazeri\nIRIS\u00a0Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g \"Military Knowledge: Shahid Soleimani Catamaran Warship\".

    "Former church in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England\nChurch in Lincolnshire, England\nSt Michael-on-the-Mount is a Grade II listed former parish church in the city of Lincoln in the ceremonial county of Lincolnshire, England. The church was originally built in 1000 AD and became later a part of the former Christ Hospital near to the Cathedral and Castle on Steeple Hill.The church was declared redundant in 1998 and was deconsecrated that same year, bringing to an end nearly 1000 years as a place of worship. Today, the church is in use as a hotel called \"The Old Palace Lodge Lincoln\".\nHistory\nAn art nouveau sign outside the former church\nFirst church (1000\u20131740)\nSt Michael on the Mount was originally built with its own churchyard in 1000 AD as one of the many parish churches in the Lincoln area and district. The church is referenced and mentioned in the Domesday Book, making it one of the oldest churches in Lincoln known to date. The church was originally the home of the Guild of Corpus Christi in 1350. It was then used as a guild chapel, and later a chantry was founded in the church by Robert Dyghton in 1521. The church later survived the Reformation period but did not survive the English Civil War in 1644 and was later reduced to ruin and disuse. After the war, the church was in a state of disrepair, with nothing but the walls still standing. A much smaller church was later built on the site between 1739\u20131740 by Thomas Sympson.\nSecond church (1856\u20131998)\nA new church with same name was built near Christ Hospital in 1855\u20131856 by renowned Gothic Revival architect SS Teulon. The new church was bigger than the original church and its replacement. In addition, the church also gained a new spire, an octagonal bell turret and a finial. The church was listed as a Grade II building in 1969 by Historic England. In 1998, with a dwindling congregation, the church was declared redundant by the Church of England and Diocese of Lincoln, It was also used briefly by the University of Lincoln as an art gallery, but this was later closed.\nPresent day\nThe former church with its spire and bell tower, now a hotel\nPresent use\nThe church underwent a \u00a3850,000 renovation which was undertaken by Franklin Ellis Architects on behalf of the Diocese of Lincoln to secure the building and its foundations. It was then converted into a 16-bedroom hotel which retains all the historical parts of the church. It is now in use as the \"Old Palace Lodge Hotel Lincoln\".\nReferences\n^ Historic England. \"Church of St Michael on the Mount (1388497)\". National Heritage List for England.

    "Custodianship of the Kaaba in Mecca is a role that concerns the affairs and caretaking of the Kaaba, including renovating it, replacing the kiswah and safeholding the key to the sanctuary. The first officially recorded custodianship of the Kaaba started with the Quraysh after the expulsion of the Khuza'ah from Mecca and is passed down from generation to generation in the Qurayshi bloodline, even until the modern period. Currently, the role of custodianship lies in the hands of the Bani Shaiba tribe.\nThe old key to the Kaaba, which was used during the late Mamluk period.\nThe person who takes up the role receives the title Custodian of the Kaaba (Arabic: \u0633\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0639\u0628\u0629, Sadinat al-Ka'bah). The current custodian of the Kaaba is Sheikh Abdul Wahhab bin Zain Al-Abidin Al-Shaibi.\nRole of the custodian\nThe custodian of the Kaaba is essentially the head of the management of the Kaaba. This may include renovating, repairing and cleaning the sanctuary as well as replacing the kiswah (covering of the Kaaba) if it is dirty or torn. The custodian themselves are the oldest member from the Quraysh tribe, specifically from the division of Bani Shaiba that is descended from the Banu Abd al-Dar division of the tribe.\nHistory\nPre-Islamic period\nIslamic exegetical tradition states that the first custodians of the Kaaba were Nebaioth and Qedar, the sons of Ishmael, before the patriarch Mudad ibn 'Amr of the Jurhum tribe usurped the custodianship of the Kaaba leaving no room of importance for the Ishmaelites. The Jurhum, however, began to mistreat the pilgrims and impose excessive taxes on them, so after years of anger at this, the Banu Khuza'ah tribe invaded Mecca and expelled all of the Jurhum before taking over the custodianship. The Quraysh rose to prominence years later, and, after an armed struggle with the Khuza'ah, were able to wrest control of all of Mecca from them, seizing custodianship of the Kaaba. Qusayy ibn Kilab of the Quraysh succeeded Abu Ghabshan of the Khuza'ah in the custodianship of the Kaaba, after the latter had sold the former the keys in exchange for wine.\nRise of Islam\nAn incident occurred in 629 CE where the cousin of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, Ali ibn Abi Talib, confiscated the key from the Abdari patriarch Uthman ibn Talha but was ordered by Muhammad to return it; afterwards Uthman ibn Talha and subsequent Abdaris converted to Islam. After the Conquest of Mecca, the custodianship by Banu Abd al-Dar was solidified when Muhammad handed over the key of the Kaaba to the descendants of Abu Talha al-Abdari and affirmed that they would be the custodians of the Kaaba until the end of times. From then on, all the patriarchs holding the key have traditionally been from Bani Shaiba, a tribe descended from the Abdaris. Sheikh Abdul Wahhab bin Zain Al-Abidin Al-Shaibi is the current holder of the key of the Kaaba as of 25 June 2024.\nList of Qurayshi custodians\nA picture of Omar Effendi, the custodian during the Ottoman period\nThis is a list of all of the Qurayshi custodians of the Kaaba in chronological order:\nQusai ibn Kilab\n'Abd al-Dar\nUthman ibn 'Abd al-Dar\n'Abd al-Uzza ibn Uthman\nAbu Talha 'Abd Allah\nTalha ibn Abi Talha\nUthman ibn Abi Talha\nShaiba ibn Uthman\nMusab ibn Shaiba\nJubayr ibn Shaiba\nMusafi' ibn Abdullah\nMansur ibn 'Abd al-Rahman\n'Abd Allah II\nMusab II\nMusafi' ibn 'Abd al-Rahman\n'Ubayd Allah ibn Uthman\nAbdullah ibn Shu'ayb\n'Abd al-Karim ibn Shu'ayb\nMuhammad ibn Abdullah\nZu'ra ibn Musab\n'Abd al-Aziz ibn Zu'ra\nInterregnum\nYahya ibn 'Abd al-Rahman\nInterregnum\nDaylam ibn Muhammad\n'Abd al-Rahman ibn Daylam\nAli ibn Yahya ibn Muhammad\nMuhammad ibn Ismail\nSee also\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques\nReferences\n^ a b c Al-Thagafi, Tareq (30 July 2020). \"A history of the management of the Kaaba\".

    "British playwright\nMargaret Macnamara (born Margaret Mary Mack; 1874 \u2013 1950) was a British playwright and suffragist whose work promoted feminist, pacifist and socialist values and opposition to eugenics.\nBiography\nMacnamara was born Margaret Mary Mack in 1874, later changing her name to Macnamara. Her parents were James Andrew Mack and Margaret Mack (n\u00e9e Norris) and she was the eldest of six children. The family lived at various places in Kent and Sussex. Macnamara and her sister Helena Mack took on domestic and childcare responsibilities in the home and cared for their elderly parents. Helena was supported financially by an aunt to attend university which left Macnamara resentful that she had not been given the same opportunity. Helena also wrote and produced plays.\nMacnamara and Helena lived in Henfield, Sussex and both belonged to the Henfield Women's Institute. Macnamara was one of the founders of the Institute in 1917 and its recording secretary; the president was Elizabeth Robins.\nOn her death in 1950 Macnamara left her estate to her niece Sylvia Legge. Legge donated her works to the University of Bristol Theatre Collection.\nCareer\nMacnamara was part of the Fabian Society and the Independent Theatre Movement.\nThemes of eugenics, motherhood and poverty are presented in Baby in the Ring which had its first performance in Henfield in 1918. In Safety has pacifist themes. Women's rights are themes of Light Gray or Dark?, The Witch and Love-Fibs.\nNineteenth century novelists Jane Austen, George Eliot and Elizabeth Gaskell had their works adapted by Macnamara. Elizabeth Refuses her adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was made into a TV programme by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1957. Macnamara's plays were performed in the United States, New Zealand and Australia.\nMacnamara held numerous positions in the theatrical world. In 1933 she was appointed Honorary Research Secretary of the Old Vic and was one of the first professional dramaturgs. During the 1920s and 1930s she was active in the British Drama League as Community Theatre Secretary, organiser of drama in schools, and organiser of drama schools for amateurs.\nPlays\nThe Gates of the Morning (1908)\nOur Little Fancies (1911)\nA Masque of Fashion (1912) - a pageant\nGeorge and Jenny (1917)\nThe Baby in the Ring (1918)\nLove\u2013Fibs (1920)\nThe Witch (1920)\nLight Gray or Dark?

    "Itinerant book trade in China\nBook boats (Chinese: \u66f8\u8239; pinyin: sh\u016bchu\u00e1n) were small merchant ships used by itinerant booksellers in China during the Ming and Qing dynasties.\nHistory\nAlthough the practice of itinerant merchants travelling along rivers and canals to sell books may have originated as early as the Song Dynasty, book boats' ubiquity to the Chinese book trade arose during the Ming Dynasty in response to expansions and repairs to waterway infrastructure.\nThe Grand Canal was a vital waterway utilized by book boats to bring books to the capital at Beijing.\nThe Jiangnan region along the lower Yangtze saw widespread infrastructure improvements during the Ming dynasty. The complex network of rivers, lakes, and canals in the region was maintained and expanded by the Ming state, allowing passenger and merchant vessels to travel between towns and cities across eastern China. The city of Huzhou, in Zhejiang, became a major center for book publishing and printing, so associated with the itinerant booksellers that book boat merchants were often referred to as \"merchants of Huzhou\" even when coming from other regions.\nThe Grand Canal was reopened under the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r.\u20091402\u20131424) in order to supply the newly establish capital city of Beijing. In addition to the flow of grain to the capital, massive numbers of books were shipped from Jiangnan via the canal. During the High Qing era, Beijing saw heavy demand for books, met mainly by book boats plying the canals from Jiangnan. This was intensified during large editing projects such as the compilation of the Siku Quanshu under the Qianlong Emperor. Although mainly bringing rare books to sell to scholars and bureaucrats, the book boats also brought more popular works, especially including law books. Floods and blockages along the Grand Canal in 1824 led to the disruption of this trade, and saw publishers move operations to Beijing in order to meet demand for legal texts.\nRiver and canal infrastructure declined as a means of transport in China over the course of the 19th century. Especially following the 1850\u20131864 Taiping Rebellion, itinerant book peddlers were sidelined in a reorganized book trade.\nBusiness practices\nBookstores were rare during the High Qing, often only found in market towns and major cities. As such, book boats were common in rural areas and smaller towns along river routes. Some peddlers specialized in rarer books for scholars and officials, while others sold for vernacular consumption across the Jiangnan.\nSongjiang, Hangzhou, and Dantu were major hubs for book trading and frequented by book boat traders.\nReferences\n^ a b Chow 2004, p.\u00a079.\n^ a b Wang 2018, p.\u00a018.\n^ a b Wang 2018, pp.\u00a021\u201323.\n^ Zhang 2017, p.\u00a0117.\n^ Zhang 2017, p.\u00a0118.\n^ Wang 2018, p.\u00a050.\nBibliography\nChow, Kai-wing (2004).

    "Fascist education, also sometimes known as Fascist pedagogy was developed during the era of Fascist regimes such as Mussolini's Italy (1922\u20131943), aimed to mold young minds to be loyal and obedient to the state and its ideologies. This system focused on creating a generation of citizens who would uphold and propagate the principles of Fascism.\nOverview\nCover of the school book \"Primavera fascista. Letture per le scuole elementari urbane\" of the fascist figure Asvero Gravelli, published by A. Mondadori, Italy, 1929.\nFascist education permeated all aspects of youth life, including extracurricular activities, youth organizations, and family dynamics. The overarching goal was to create a generation of individuals who were unwaveringly loyal to the Fascist state, willing to defend its principles, and propagate its ideologies throughout their lives.\nThe main and best-known representative of fascist education is Giovanni Gentile. As Minister of Education, Gentile implemented sweeping reforms to the Italian education system, known as the Gentile Reform.\nFascist states pursued policies of social indoctrination through propaganda in education and the media, and regulation of the production of educational and media materials. Education was designed to glorify the fascist movement and inform students of its historical and political importance to the nation. It attempted to purge ideas that were not consistent with the beliefs of the fascist movement and to teach students to be obedient to the state. Marinetti promoted the need of physical training of young men saying that, in male education, gymnastics should take precedence over books. He advocated segregation of the genders because womanly sensibility must not enter men's education, which he claimed must be \"lively, bellicose, muscular and violently dynamic.\"\nBasic aspects\nThe basic aspects of Fascist education were:\nIdeological Indoctrination\nCurriculum and educational materials were heavily infused with Fascist propaganda. History, literature, and even science subjects were taught in ways that supported the regime's doctrines and glorified its leaders.\nCult of Personality\nCentral figures like Benito Mussolini were portrayed as heroic saviors of the nation. Their images and stories of their supposed greatness were omnipresent in classrooms and educational resources.\nEmphasis on Physical Education and Military Training\nPhysical education and military training were critical components of the curriculum. The regime believed that a strong, healthy, and disciplined body was essential for the nation's strength. Activities such as sports, gymnastics, and military drills were commonplace.\nNationalism and Militarism\nEducation fostered an intense sense of nationalism and readiness for military service. Youth organizations like Italy's Opera Nazionale Balilla and Germany's Hitler Youth were instrumental in instilling these values and preparing young people for future roles as soldiers and loyal citizens.\nGender-Specific Roles\nBoys and girls were educated with distinct roles in mind. Boys were trained to be warriors and leaders, while girls were prepared for motherhood and domestic duties, emphasizing their roles in supporting the family and the state.\nSuppression of Dissent and Critical Thinking\nCritical thinking and dissent were discouraged. The educational system promoted conformity and obedience to the state. Ideas that contradicted Fascist ideology, such as liberalism, communism, and democracy, were vilified.\nRacial and Cultural Superiority\nParticularly in Nazi Germany, education was used to promote notions of racial purity and superiority. Textbooks and lessons often included racist ideologies, teaching children to believe in the supremacy of the Aryan race and to despise those deemed inferior.\nAnti-Communism and Anti-Liberalism\nCommunist and liberal ideas were portrayed as dangerous and destructive. The education system aimed to create a deep-seated aversion to these ideologies among the youth.\nSee also\nUr-Fascism\nAnti-fascist education\nReferences\n^ Stecher, Constance F.

    "Mountain range in the region of Southern Lebanon\nMount Safi, also known as Jabal Safi (\u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0635\u0627\u0641\u064a) is a mountain located in the southernmost part of the Mount Lebanon mountain range. It has an elevation of at least 1300 meters, with a prominence of around 222 meters. The mountain is north of the Lebanese city of Nabatieh as well.\nName\nThe name of the mountain, Safi, is derived from the local tradition that the prophet Zephaniah (Safiniah in Arabic) was buried on the mountain, hence the name Safi. \nGeography\nPosition\nThe mountain is located in the south of Lebanon in the Mohafazat Liban-Sud region. The elevation of the mountain is around 1379 meters, with a prominence of at least 222 meters. Mount Safi is part of the Lebanese portion of mountain ranges within the Levant. 21 kilometres away from the mountain is the border which divides Israel from Lebanon.\nLocalities\nMount Safi has four localities in its proximity, which are the villages of Jbaa, Mlikh, Ain Bousouar and Ain Qana. The mountain's location is north of the city of Nabatieh.\nStrategic importance\nDue to its close proximity to the border dividing Israel and Lebanon, the Islamist paramilitary group Hezbollah used the location as a site to launch missiles against Israel.\nArab-Israeli conflict\nCold War\nAccording to a 1998 letter addressed to the United Nations, the localities around Mount Safi and its surroundings were intercepted, airstriked and came under artillery fire by the Israeli forces within February of that year.\nAfter 1998\nThe Hezbollah paramilitary group used parts of the mountain to fire anti-aircraft missiles into Israel territory, taking advantage of the mountain's close proximity to the border. On the 28th of June 2024, Israeli forces launched several airstrikes on Mount Safi, which was reportedly a defensive move against the Hezbollah. The airstrikes damaged several villages within the locality of the mountain and killed four people, including a Hezbollah militant.\nSee also\nList of mountains in Lebanon\nReferences\n^ PeakVisor. \"Jabal Safi\".

    "K-type star in the constellation Delphinus.\nHD 194688, also designated as HR 7816, is a solitary star located in the northern constellation Delphinus, the dolphin. It has an apparent magnitude of 6.22, placing it near the limit for naked eye visibility. The object is located relatively far away at a distance of 886 light-years based on Gaia DR3 parallax measurements, but it is drifting closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of \u221217.12\u00a0km/s. At its current distance, HD 196488's brightness is diminished due to an interstellar extinction of 0.17 magnitudes and it has an absolute visual magnitude of \u22121.19.\nHD 194688 has a simple stellar classification of K0, indicating that it is an early K-type star. It has 1.57 times the mass of the Sun and an enlarged radius 21.58 times that of the Sun.  It radiates 258 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,995\u00a0K, giving it an orangish-yellow hue when viewed in the night sky. The large radius and high luminosity suggests that HD 194688 may be an evolved giant star. It is slightly metal-deficient with an iron abundance 74.1% that of the Sun's.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g Vallenari, A.; et\u00a0al. (Gaia collaboration) (2023). \"Gaia Data Release 3.

    "American politician\nFrederick James Whiffen (January 18, 1848 \u2013 December 1, 1929) was an American politician who served in the Los Angeles City Council from 1910 until 1913, serving as President of the Los Angeles City Council from 1913 to 1915. He pursued a career in retail before moving into business ventures in cattle and iron manufacturing. He later shifted his focus to real estate, relocating to Los Angeles in 1892. Whiffen was elected to the City Council as part of the Good Government organization and played a key role in local politics, including a mayoral run in 1915 election.\nEarly life and career\nWhiffen was born on January 18, 1848, in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin to William Whiffen and Mary Ann Hitchcock. He received his education at a district school and attended Bryant and Chase Business College in Chicago, Illinois. He began his career as a clerk in a retail dry goods store before partnering with M. A. Calkins in 1873 to form the firm Whiffen & Calkins. The business grew significantly, and in 1887, Whiffen sold his interest in the company. He then invested in a herd of range cattle in Wyoming and an iron manufacturing business in Rockford, Illinois. By 1890, he had sold these investments and shifted his focus to real estate. In 1892, Whiffen moved to Los Angeles, California.\nLos Angeles City Council\nWhiffen and Stewart take the oath of office in 1910.\nOn March 22, 1910, two members of the Los Angeles City Council, John D. Works and Richmond Plant, resigned. Works left to pursue a seat in the U.S. Senate, while Plant resigned amid an investigation. Following their resignations, the City Council called for an election to fill the vacant seats. On April 17, 1910, Whiffen announced his candidacy for the Good Government nomination and was subsequently nominated along with George H. Stewart.\nIn the primary election, Whiffen placed fourth, behind Bernard Healy, Stewart, and Arthur D. Houghton. In the general election, he and Stewart won the election, gaining the two seats for the Good Government organization. He stated that he had \"no interest, directly or indirectly, with any corporation\" and vowed to represent the people faithfully.\nIn 1911, Whiffen ran for re-election on the general ticket for the Good Government organization. In the general election, Whiffen placed eighth and was re-elected to the city council. On July 1, 1913, Whiffen was elected as the President of the Los Angeles City Council. He officially took office on July 7, succeeding George Williams.\nMayoral campaign\nIn 1915, Whiffen announced his candidacy for the mayoral election. His platform included promoting the consolidation of the city and county, developing the Harbor area, and keeping the city free from corruption. When the filing petitions for the mayoral race expired, Whiffen was up against five other candidates. Among them were Chief of Police Charles E. Sebastian and future councilmembers Robert M. Allan and Ralph Luther Criswell. He and Sebastian advanced in the primary, and in the runoff election on June 2, Sebastian defeated Whiffen by a majority of 4,509 votes. In September 1916, Whiffen alleged that he had been offered the position of mayor for $2,500 to succeed Sebastian, who had resigned amid scandal. This accusation prompted an investigation by District Attorney Thomas L. Woolwine to look into the charges.\nPersonal life\nWhiffen married Adah Maria Hobart on December 27, 1871, in Winnebago, Illinois. The couple had four children together before her death on January 7, 1910. During his tenure as a councilmember, he lived in the neighborhood San Pedro. Whiffen passed away at his home on December 1, 1929.\nElectoral history\nReferences\n^ a b Who's Who in the Pacific Southwest.

    "Mountain in Montana, United States\nScotch Bonnet Mountain is a 10,385-foot (3,165-metre) summit in Park County, Montana, United States.\nDescription\nScotch Bonnet Mountain is located four miles (6.4\u00a0km) north of Cooke City, Montana, in the Beartooth Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. It is set within the New World Mining District and the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's south slope drains into headwaters of Fisher Creek which is a tributary of the Clarks Fork Yellowstone River, whereas the north slope drains into Goose Creek which is a tributary of the nearby Stillwater River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises approximately 1,760 feet (536 meters) above Goose Creek in 1.2 miles (1.9\u00a0km). The mountain's rock composition ranges from diorite to monzodiorite and \nis commonly propylitized. The Montana Scotch Bonnet Copper and Gold Mining Company worked this area near Lulu Pass in the early 1900s and the mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. The area from Cooke City to Scotch Bonnet Mountain offers some of the finest backcountry snowmobiling in the country. On January 3, 2010, two snowmobilers riding on the south face of Scotch Bonnet Mountain triggered an avalanche resulting in one fatality. An avalanche on the mountain killed two snowmobilers on December 27, 2021.\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Scotch Bonnet Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F.\nSee also\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Scotch Bonnet Mountain, Montana\".

    "New Zealand mayor\nJoseph Mitchell Huggan JP (16 June 1897-6 September 1957) was an English-born New Zealand politician.\nBiography\nEarly life and career\nHuggan was born in 1897 at Pudsey, Yorkshire. He was the son of stonemason Jonathan Huggan and his wife Hannah Mitchell. He was employed in the spinning trade in his youth. During World War I he served in France with the West Yorkshire Regiment.\nAfter the war he emigrated to New Zealand. On 14 July 1923 he married Annie Brown at St Hilda's Church in Upper Hutt. No children came from the marriage.\nHuggan worked at the Petone woolen mill. In 1924 his family moved from Upper Hutt to Korokoro, where he worked as a labourer. In 1932 he and his wife began to run the Korokoro general store, initially located in the front room of their house. The store would later additionally host a post office. He possessed a vehicle and operated a delivery service as well. Huggan's parents came to live with him so he purchased a 4\u00bd acre section behind their store in 1933 to build them their own dwelling.\nDuring the Great Depression Huggan worked with the unemployed as part of the local relief committee. Huggan and his wife became known the uncrowned 'mayor and mayoress of Korokoro' for their efforts. For his community work he became a justice of the peace in 1932 and was president of the Korokoro Progressive Association which in November 1931, after much lobbying, got a bus service to the area started. The association organised summer carnivals in 1934 and 1935.\nPolitical career\nIn 1935 Huggan was elected to the Petone Borough Council on the Labour Party ticket. He was a popular councillor, known for his \"Yorkshire wit\" and cheery demeanour. His wife was often an advisor to him on community matters. In 1950 he was elected mayor. As mayor he moved from Korokoro to Cuba Street in Petone to live with an elderly uncle of his wife. He was returned unopposed for two further terms as mayor and was also on the fire board, the milk board and the Hutt Valley drainage, power and river boards. He was fiercely opposed to the suggestion of amalgamation with the neighbouring city of Lower Hutt.\nHuggan instigated a street widening policy. The plan was for the council to purchase buildings in disrepair along the Petone Esplanade to widen the street. A multi-lane roadway on the esplanade was then built which linked up to a recently constructed pipe bridge at the mouth of the Hutt River. In a jovial gesture he presented his wife in 1954 with a brooch to compensate for the amount of time he had been late home from night meetings.\nDeath\nHuggan died suddenly of a brain hemorrhage on 6 September 1957 at Hutt Hospital. His wife succeeded him as mayor, becoming one of the first husband-wife combinations to be mayors in New Zealand after Michael and Elizabeth Yates.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f McDonnell, Hilda. \"Huggan, Joseph Mitchell and Huggan, Lily Annie\".

    "American swimmer\nDavid \"Haucker\" Hauck (July 26, 1931 - July 13, 2019) was an American competitive swimmer for Gustavus Adolphus College and a swimming coach for St. Olaf College serving as Head Coach for 40 years from 1973-2013, where he led the team to 43 Minnesota Conference (MIAC) championships which included 28 for the men's team, and 15 for the women's teams.  While at St. Olaf, he also served 30 years as an Assistant Football Coach, 9 years as the Gymnastic's Coach for Men, seven years as the Men's Golf Coach, and six years as a softball coach.\nEducation and swimming\nBorn on July 26, 1931 in Madison, Minnesota to Mary and Leslie Hauck, he attended Madison High School, graduating in 1949.\nHauck attended and swam for Gustavus Adolphus College, in St. Peter Minnesota, about 150 miles Southeast of Madison, where he was coached by Vic Gustafson, and became a Minnesota Interscholastic Athletic Conference (MIAC) individual champion six times. He met his future wife Mary Lundgren while attending St. Olaf. On March 3, 1951, he won the 100-yard freestyle at the MIAC championship with a time of 56.6, also winning the 60-yard event. In 1952 he helped lead Gustavus Adolphus to the MIAC Team Conference Championship, earning two more individual titles that included a win in the 50-yard freestyle where he set a new state record of 24.7 seconds, as well as a win in the 100-yard freestyle.  \nIn the 1953 MIAC Championships, he set another 50-yard freestyle record, and was on a winning 400-yard relay team that set a record time of 3:54.8. With Hauck scoring consistently in the conference championships, Gustavus Adolphus were the runners-up for the Minnesota (MIAC) state conference championship in both 1951 and 1953, demonstrating the team's high standing in the conference during Hauck's tenure as a swimmer.\nGraduating Gustavus in 1953, he obtained a Master\u2019s degree in physical education at Minnesota's Bemidji State University, and served in the Army Medical Corps from 1953-1955.  He married his wife Mary while still in the service on July 10, 1954, in her hometown of Warren, Minnesota.\nCoaching\nBeginning his coaching career after completing his military service, Hauck coached and taught in Henderson, Minnesota from around 1955-1958.  From 1958-1966, he coached and taught in his hometown of Madison, Minnesota, where in May 1966 while coaching football at Madison Prep, he was a nominee for the Coach of the Year by the Minnesota Football Coaches Association.\nSt. Olaf\nFrom 1966 through 1973, Hauck coached Gymnastics at St. Olaf.  He then served as the men's head swimming coach from 1973-2013, where he led the swim team to 43 Minnesota Conference (MIAC) championships which included 28 for the men's team, and 15 for the women's teams.  Hauck may have assisted with the swimming program a few years after stepping down as head coach in 2013, through around 2016, as his total time with the St. Olaf Men's swim team was 44 years, or he may have had a few years prior to 1973 as an Assistant Coach. He coached St. Olaf's women's swimming team as Head Coach from around 1989-2013. Invaluable to the team during his tenure, Hauck also coached diving for a period.\nThough swimming in a less than optimal facility built in 1967, which lacked a 3-meter diving board, Hauck's Men's swim teams at St. Olaf won their first Conference title in 1977 only four years after he began as head swimming coach in 1973, and then repeated as MIAC champions from 1980-1999, dominating their conference for twenty years.  As noted previously, Hauck coached the men's swim team for a total 44 seasons beginning in 1973, and the women's team for a total 27 seasons, beginning in 1989.  His St. Olaf Men's and Women's swimming teams together had 21 national finishes in the top-10 with 16 for men, and five for women. During Hauck's coaching tenure, St. Olaf had 21 Division III NCAA individual national titles and one NCAA relay national championship.\nWhile at St. Olafs, he also served 30 years as an Assistant Football Coach beginning in the late 60's, seven years as the Gymnastic's Coach for Men from 1966-1973, seven years as the Men's Golf Coach, and six years as the softball coach. Earning a Masters from Bemidji State University in Physical Education, Hauck also taught in St. Olaf's Exercise Department for thirty years.\nOutstanding swimmers\nHauck's most outstanding St. Olaf team members included Gabe Kortuem who won a 1 meter diving title in 2002, future American Airlines Executive, Tim Niznik who won a 100 fly title in 1990, and a 200 IM title in 1990, and Nelson Westby whose four titles included three in the 200 IM between 2007-09 and one in the 200 breaststroke in 2009. Kortuem later served as St. Olaf's diving coach for at least 20 years, beginning around the 2002 season. He also coached Kevin Casson to an impressive five titles that included two in the 500 free in 1986 and 1989 and three in the 1650 free in 1987-89.  \nMost unique, outstanding and devoted among his s",
    "New Zealand flute maker\nTrevor Wyn Albert Hutton (January 25, 1923 \u2013 December 21, 2017) was a New Zealand flute maker, flautist, and jeweller. He played the flute from a young age and pursued a career as a jeweller before turning to flute making.\nFlute manufacture\nTrevor Hutton began his flute-making journey in the 1970s by crafting a new headjoint for his flute. Subsequently, he completed a new flute body made of gold and silver, which he used in professional engagements. Without access to pre-made tubing from bullion merchants, Hutton created his own tubing, posts, keys, springs, and screws from raw materials. In his early years, he made his own pads from felt and animal intestine skins, assisted by his father when pads were scarce. Hutton sourced gold and silver from various means, including recovery from photographic processes, and made alloys for flute making. On average, crafting a flute took him about 200 hours. After visiting Powell Flutes in Boston, USA, he gained insights into their manufacturing processes. Although unable to afford similar equipment, he started importing pre-formed tubing and flute pads, reducing the manufacturing time. Hutton crafted concert flutes, alto flutes, bass flutes, and piccolos.\nFlautist\nTrevor Hutton was taught to play the flute by his father and earned his LTCL around 1940. He joined Derry's Military Band at the age of 10 and the Christchurch Savage Club at 14, where he became a life member. Hutton also joined the public 3YA radio orchestra until 1959, playing live pieces for flute and piano. Hutton played jazz with Brian Marston, Doug Caldwell, and the Amigos, and formed the Serendipity Flutes flute choir in the late 1980s, which had up to 11 players. He played in a woodwind quartet alongside Jack Goldsmith (oboe), Michael Shorter (clarinet), Ross McKeitch (bassoon), and William Turner (French horn). The quintet often performed lunchtime concerts at the Great Hall of Canterbury University, now the Christchurch Arts Centre, where Hutton also gave solo recitals.\nHe was offered the principal flute position in the National Orchestra (later the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra) but declined due to family commitments and housing difficulties in Wellington. However, he did play with the orchestra during their Christchurch performances. Hutton served as the principal flute for the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra for 14 years from 1964, performing works such as Mozart's flute concertos and Brandenburg concertos. In later years, he joined the Risingholme Orchestra.\nJeweller\nHutton left school at 15 and apprenticed as a jeweller with Richards and Henshall, working there for 22 years. He later worked for Kennedys Diamond Rings and Sladen and Son Jewellers for 11 years each before retiring from jewellery to focus on his flute-making business.\nPersonal life\nTrevor Wyn Albert Hutton was born on January 25, 1923, to Albert and Doris Hutton, both flute players. He married Hazel Hutton (n\u00e9e Tolchard) on April 27, 1946, and they had three children: Judith, Graeme, and Andrew. Raised in Spreydon, Christchurch, Hutton attended Christchurch Normal School and West Christchurch High School. He had a passion for motorbikes, starting with his father's 1923 Harley Davidson and owning several Harley Davidsons throughout his life.\nInterviews and media appearances\nIn 2011, Hutton was interviewed on four occasions by the Christchurch Flute Society. He was also featured in newspaper articles and an episode of the television program Spot On, where he demonstrated flute making.\nReferences\n\u00a0This article incorporates text available under the CC0 license.\n^ \"Trevor Hutton Obituary\".

    "Cuban revolutionary and politician (1841-1872)\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Agramonte and the second or maternal family name is  Pi\u00f1a.\nEduardo Agramonte y Pi\u00f1a (1841 - March 8, 1872) was a Cuban revolutionary, doctor, and politician who was killed during the Ten Years' War in Cuba.\nEarly life\nEduardo Agramonte y Pi\u00f1a was born in Puerto Pr\u00edncipe (now Camag\u00fcey) in 1841. His first cousin was Cuban patriot Ignacio Agramonte. Aristides Agramonte, his son, was born in the summer of 1868 in Cuba.\nAgramonte's profession was a doctor before the independence campaigns.\nHe was an active member of the Masonic Order of T\u00ednima No. 16, established in Camag\u00fcey in 1866. Although some were against political matters being discussed in their sessions, the T\u00ednima Masonic Lodge was adopted by Camag\u00fcey revolutionaries as the conspiracy's hub in Central Cuba. In meetings coordinated by Oriente's Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes with different revolutionary groups, it was proposed to support the cause of an insurrection in Eastern Cuba.\nTen Years' War\nAgramonte took action when the war of independence against Spain erupted on October 10, 1868, following the Cry of Yara.\nLas Clavellinas Uprising\nHe was instrumental in the Las Clavellinas Uprising in Camag\u00fcey in November 1868. Once Salvador Cisneros Betancourt conveyed the uprising circumstances, Eduardo Agramonte Pi\u00f1a summoned his loyal allies to convene at dawn the next day. The Las Clavellinas river, three miles from Puerto Pr\u00edncipe (now Camag\u00fcey), was the meeting point for 76 Cuban patriots on November 4, 1868, who were determined to partake in the revolt. Col. Eduardo Agramonte Pi\u00f1a proposed a military structure of the insurgents and Gen. Jer\u00f3nimo Boza Agramonte assumed command as the superior chief.\nEstablished on November 26, 1868, the Revolutionary Committee of Camag\u00fcey, acting as the provisional provincial government, was chaired by Salvador Cisneros Betancourt, and included Eduardo Agramonte and Ignacio Agramonte. Agramonte y Pe\u00f1a, alongside Salvador Cisneros Betancourt, Ignacio Agramonte, Francisco S\u00e1nchez y Betancourt, and Antonio Zambrana signed the Decree of Abolition of Slavery (Spanish: Abolici\u00f3n de la Esclavitud) on February 26, 1869, formally abolishing slavery in Camag\u00fcey.\nPolitical career\nWhen Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes became President of the Republic of Cuba in Arms in April 1869, Eduardo Agramonte was appointed to the C\u00e9spedes cabinet as the Secretary of the Interior.\nAgramonte and others from the second Cuban Junta were convicted of treason and rebellion in November 1870, with a death sentence by garrote awaiting them if they fell into Spanish hands.\nBattle of San Jos\u00e9 del Chorrillo\nCol. Eduardo Agramonte Pi\u00f1a, met his end at the 1872 Battle of San Jos\u00e9 del Chorrillo.\nDeath\nEduardo Agramonte y Pi\u00f1a was killed in action in San Jos\u00e9 del Chorrillo, Camag\u00fcey Province in Cuba on March 8, 1872. Following his death, his family sought refuge in the United States.\nReferences\n^ Terry,\u00a0T.\u00a0P.\u00a0(1929).\u00a0Terry's Guide to Cuba, Including the Isle of Pines, with a Chapter on the Ocean Routes to the Island: A Handbook for Travelers, with 3 Specially Drawn Maps and 7 Plans.\u00a0United States:\u00a0Houghton Mifflin.\n^ Album de el Criollo: semblanzas.\u00a0(1888).\u00a0Cuba:\u00a0Est. tip.

    "\nHospital in Attica, Greece\nThe General Hospital of Western Attica \"Agia Varvara\" is a nursing institution located in the Municipality of the same name.\nHistory\nIt began its operation in 1903, under the name \"Kantharos\". Three years later it was renamed Hospital of Smallpox Patients (\u0395\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd). In 1970, it acquired another name as the Public Hospital of Infectious Diseases (\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf \u039d\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u039b\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd \u039d\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd), which is still used today, while it received its final name in 1987. In 1995, the name of the city where it is located was added to the title. The Hospital belongs to the 2nd Health Region of Piraeus and Aegean.\nIn 2013, during the ministry of Adonis Georgiadis, the hospital ceased its operation as a tertiary hospital. The Artificial Kidney Unit and the regular outpatient clinics remained in operation in the building, while the majority of its staff was transferred to other hospitals. Furthermore, by a decision of the then Minister of Public Order, Nikos Dendias, it was planned to convert until then abandoned buildings near the hospital into accommodation centers for immigrants and vulnerable social groups. The change of use of the hospital's infrastructure caused reactions from the then opposition, local bodies, residents and staff.\nIn 2016, during the ministry of Andreas Xanthos, the following were transferred to his facilities: the Nice Prosthetic Center, the physical therapy clinic and the Mother, Child and Adolescent Protection Station that were located at the Nice Prosthetic Center.\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic in Greece in 2020, it was converted into a hospital for the exclusive treatment of patients suffering from the coronavirus.\nReferences\n^ \"\"\u039d\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 - \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2\" \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 22/8/2019\".

    "2014 American documentary film\nFake It So Real is a 2011 American present tense documentary film that follows a group of ragtag wrestlers in North Carolina as they prepare for a big show. Functioning both as an essay on performance and a commentary on the working-class South.\nSynopsis\nDirector Robert Greene is cousins with amateur wrestler Chris Solar. This connection sparked the idea to make a film about the wrestling scene in working class North Carolina. The film follows the preparation for a DIY match, tracking wrestlers Gabriel Croft, J-Prep, Keith Matthews, Pitt, Zane Riley, Brandon Powers, David Hayes, Hojo Devlin, Mikado, and AG Smooth.\nRobert Greene describes the film as \"Fake It So Real follows a group of independent pro wrestlers in North Carolina over one week leading up to a single show.  What emerges over this week is the sense of purpose that wrestling gives these guys and the camaraderie and real family that they create around their passion for performing and competing for a small but very vocal fanbase. The film is really about doing something that matters to you at all costs.\"\nCritical reception\nThe New York Times called the film \"agonizingly genuine\"  while The New Yorker's Richard Brody said \"Though the matches themselves, with their crude narrative frameworks and stereotypes, may be something of an anticlimax, the film unearths the tough and complex life experiences they distill.\"\nThe film played at both Maryland Film Festival and Visions du Reel, eventually being released by Factory 25. In 2024 Vinegar Syndrome released a special edition Blu-ray of the film.\nAwards\nSarasota Film Festival\nNominated, Best Documentary Feature\nReferences\n^ https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fake-it-so-real-2012\n^ https://english.chass.ncsu.edu/fake-it-so-real-gets-real-recognition/\n^ https://www.starnewsonline.com/story/news/2011/11/09/fake-it-so-real-about-more-than-wrestling/30877867007/\n^ https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/fake-it-so-real/\n^ https://rooftopfilms.com/blog/2011/07/meet-the-filmmaker-robert-greene-fake-it-so-real/\n^ https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/movies/fake-it-so-real-visits-the-small-world-of-wrestling-review.html?smid=tw-nytimesmovies&seid=auto\n^ https://mubi.com/en/us/films/fake-it-so-real\n",

    "Eastern orthodox venerable and saint\nTheoclite or Theoclite the Wonderworker (Greek: \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce \u03b7 \u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ae) was a Byzantine and Eastern Orthodox saint of the 9th century. Living under the reign of the iconoclastic Emperor Theophilos, she distinguished herself by her numerous actions in favor of the poor and her Christian life in general. Her incorrupt relics were believed by the Eastern Orthodox to be the source of several miracles. She is commemorated on August 3rd with the title of Venerable.\nBiography\nTheoclite was born in the Theme of the Optimatoi; her parents were named Constantine and Anastasia. Her parents, from a relatively high social background, forced her to marry a man named Zacharias, whom she is said to have guided onto the \"right path\".\nThroughout her life, Theoclite is said to have been involved in numerous Christian works, notably by welcoming many people in need into her home and distributing significant portions of her wealth for charitable purposes. The Byzantine saint reportedly summoned her friends before her death to joyfully announce the news of her impending death.\nLegacy\nHer incorrupt body is said to have produced miracles. She is commemorated on August 3rd and bears the title of Venerable. Her name, which means \"called by God\", appears in several different forms, sometimes as \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce (Theoklit\u00f3) and sometimes as \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b7 (The\u00f3kliti), though this might possibly refer to another saint with the same name who is celebrated on August 21st in some manuscripts.\nEastern Orthodox liturgy\nIn Eastern Orthodox liturgy, she is honored with hymns, such as her apolytikion, which reads as follows:\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"\u039c\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039f\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0398\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\". \u039f\u03c1\u03b8\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03af\u03b1 News Agency (in Greek). 2021-08-03.

    "Municipal building in London, England\nThe Old Town Hall is a former municipal building at the corner of Poplar High Street and Woodstock Terrace in Poplar, London. The building, which currently accommodates the Lansbury Heritage Hotel, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe building was commissioned by the Poplar District Board of Works to serve as its hall and offices. The site the board selected, on the north side of Poplar High Street, had been occupied by a row of alms houses erected by the East India Company in 1628.\nConstruction of the new building started in 1869. It was designed by Walter Augustus Hills and Thomas Wayland Fletcher with Arthur and Christopher Harston in the Gothic Revival style, built in yellow brick at a cost of \u00a37,500 and was completed in October 1870. The design involved a distinctive three-stage octagonal tower at the southeast corner. The first stage involved a round headed opening flanked by Corinthian order colonettes supporting an archivolt and a keystone with elaborate carvings in the spandrels. There were sash windows on the first floor and sash windows with tracery on the second floor, all surmounted by a dome, a spire and a weather vane. The rest of the building was fenestrated by sash windows. The floors were separated by bands with mosaic detail. At roof level, there was a modillioned cornice and a series of dormer windows.\nThe building became the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar in 1900. It was the scene of the Poplar Rates Rebellion, led by George Lansbury, which advocated the use of rates for social reform, and ultimately resulted in 19 councillors being put in prison in 1921. The building ceased to be the local seat of government when the council moved to the new town hall in Bow Street in 1938.\nThe old town hall remained in council ownership, being used as a district housing centre from 1986, until Tower Hamlets London Borough Council sold it to a developer, Dreamstar Limited, in 2011. It was subsequently converted into a boutique hotel, opening as the Lansbury Heritage Hotel in 2015.\nReferences\n^ a b Historic England. \"Old Poplar Town Hall and Council Offices (1260135)\".

    "1975 civil war\nThis article is about the 1975 civil war. For the 2006 conflict, see 2006 East Timorese crisis.\nIn August 1975, a civil war broke out between two opposing political parties in Portuguese Timor: the conservative Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) and the left-leaning Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin). The war took place within the context of decolonisation, as the post-Carnation Revolution Portuguese government sought to give independence to much of the Portuguese Empire. UDT and Fretilin were formed in May 1974, following the legalisation of political parties in Portugal. UDT initially advocated for continuing ties to Portugal, before shifting to promoting a gradual independence process that maintained existing institutions. Fretilin sought independence with a new political system that would address a widespread lack of development in the territory. Also formed during this time was the Timorese Popular Democratic Association (Apodeti), which advocated for an Indonesian annexation of the territory, although Apodeti gained far less popular support than the other two major parties.\nDiscussions about the future of East Timor took place within the context of the views of neighbouring Indonesia. The Indonesian government saw an independent East Timor with a potentially communist government as a security risk. This view found receptive ears among western governments affected by the recent loss of the Vietnam War. As the left-leaning Fretilin established itself as a popular political force, Indonesia applied pressure on Portugal and the other East Timorese political parties to find a pathway excluding Fretilin. The UDT and Fretilin found common ground and made a joint proposal to Portugal in January 1975 on a path to independence. However, deep mistrust between both parties, especially between their more radical wings, eventually led to a breakdown of relations.\nTensions between UDT and Fretilin came to a head on 11 August 1975 when UDT forces took control of key points in the cities of Dili and Baucau. Although this was successful and caused Fretilin leaders to flee, Fretilin began a counter-attack on 20 August. After retaking the two major cities, Fretilin continued its military campaign, and took control of most of the country by early September. The conflict exacerbated existing local tensions throughout the territory, and between 1,500 and 3,000 people are thought to have been killed during this period by both forces and in other acts of violence. The remaining Portuguese authorities retreated to the island of Atauro, while UDT leaders fled to Indonesia, leaving Fretilin as the effective government. Fretilin called for the return of Portuguese authorities and a resumption of decolonisation discussions, while setting up a caretaker government to manage the territory in the meantime.\nUDT leaders that had retreated to Indonesia began to advocate for Indonesian annexation, and Indonesia provided them with training and other military support. Indonesian special forces worked with the UDT to carry out attacks near the border, making limited gains in October. On 20 November a new offensive was launched with more significant Indonesian support. Following the refusal of Portuguese authorities to return, and losing ground to the combined UDT/Indonesian offensive, Fretilin hastily declared the independent Democratic Republic of East Timor. Indonesia responded by publicly coming out in favour of annexation, launching a full-scale invasion on 7 December, and setting up the Provisional Government of East Timor led by its allied political parties. Indonesia formally annexed East Timor on 17 July 1976.\nBackground\nMain article: History of East Timor\nEast Timor shares the island of Timor with Indonesia. The island lies to the northwest of Australia, in particular the city of Darwin.\nNew Portuguese political system\nPortuguese presence on the island of Timor started sometime in the 16th century. In the 20th century, anti-colonial movements in Portuguese Africa prompted the emergence of a national identity in East Timor. Portuguese Timor was still a relatively peaceful colony under Portuguese rule when the 25 April 1974 Carnation Revolution overthrew the previous Portuguese regime, despite armed rebellion occurring in other Portuguese colonies. The new government was nonetheless committed to the decolonisation of East Timor.:\u200a411\u200a Governor Fernando Alves Aldeia\u00a0 was instructed to prepare for decolonisation while maintaining a good relationship with Indonesia. He created the Timor Commission for Self-Determination on 13 May 1975. Self-determination for its colonies was enshrined in the Constitution of Portugal around this time.:\u200a14\u201315\u200a\nPolitical parties aside from the former National Union were legalised, and five parties formed in East Timor. The two largest were the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) and the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin). The Timorese Popular Demo",

He was born into a Goan Catholic family and grew up with six siblings: Domingos, Antonio (born 1964), Roque (born 1966), Ana (born 1952), Rosa (born 1959), and Inacio (born 1953).\nCareer\nCoelho has been involved in several Konkani films and theatrical productions in recent years. In December 2014, he was cast in the Konkani film Home Sweet Home, directed by Swapnil Shetkar. The following year, in December 2015, he reprised his role in the sequel to this film, titled Home Sweet Home 2. In May 2015, Coelho was cast in the tiatr (a form of Goan theater) Mhaka Tuji Goroz (I Need Your Aid), directed by his brother, Comedian Domnic. In this production, Coelho played the lead character of Climax, who was described by a critic from the local newspaper O Heraldo as a \"comedic and likeable role.\" The critic also observed that the characters created by Domnic and Coelho were fundamentally strong, appealing, and occasionally displayed a subtle sense of humor.\nCoelho has made several appearances in the tiatr theatrical tradition. In June 2015, he was cast in the tiatr production Mhozo Sangati Tho (He's My Companion), which was directed by Patrick Dourado. In this performance, Coelho portrayed a comedian, starring alongside his brother Comedian Domnic and Comedian Sally. Coelho's work in this tiatr production was praised by critics. Just a few months later, in August 2015, he was cast in another tiatr, titled Bailek Dukh, Kumarik Sukh (Wife's Pain, Mistress's Happiness), which was written by Conception de Tuem. Once again, Coelho took on a comedic role, this time performing alongside an ensemble that included Comedienne Joana, Jane, and Humbert. The collaborative efforts of the cast in this tiatr were also well received.\nIn August 2015, Coelho was cast in the tiatr production Osleo Suno (Such Daughter-in- laws), directed by Tony de Ribandar. In this play, he portrayed the comedic character of Derefent, performing opposite Comedienne Janet as a comic couple. He shared the stage with other comedic performers, including Comedian Sally and Dorothy. Two months later, in November 2015, Coelho was cast in an unnamed tiatr, where he played a comedian alongside his brother, Comedian Domnic. The following year, in November 2016, he was cast in the Konkani film War-Onn by Mozin Travasso. In this production, Coelho took on comic roles alongside actors Kenny and Comedian Nato.\nIn May 2017, Coelho was cast in the tiatr Kevpachim Bavlim Nhoi (Not a Toy to Play) produced by Mini Mario. In this production, he portrayed a comedian, performing alongside other well-known Goan artists such as John D' Silva, Regina, Bladwin, and Jack de Colva. A critique published in the local newspaper O Heraldo highlighted that the actors were engaging, but the humor lacked originality during the performance. The following year, in July 2017, Coelho was cast in another tiatr titled Go To Hell produced by Milagres de Chandor. In this production, he played a comic role, performing alongside other comedic actors including Comedian Selvy, Comedian Richard, and Comedian Nato.\nPersonal life\nCoelho, aged 32, married Iria Rodrigues, aged 22, a college student from Cortalim, Goa, on 11 December 1994. The couple had previously completed their civil marriage registration in Ponda, Goa, two days before the religious ceremony at St. Francis Xavier Chapel in Muxer, Bandora, Goa. Together, they have two sons - Toni (born 1995), and Shaun (born 1997). Coelho has a close relationship with his brother, Comedian Domnic, who is also a Konkani comedian and actor.\nAn artwork dedicated to Coelho during the 44th IFFI\nCoelho has provided significant support and involvement in his brother's work within the Konkani theatre scene. He resided in the Muxer, Bandora neighborhood of Goa as of 2012. Coelho later relocated to London, UK, where he is currently based. He frequently traveled to his home state Goa to work on Konkani films like Fotting No.1 (2022) directed by Joywin Fernandes and tiatr productions such as Past is Past (2023) by Comedian Agostinho.\nReferences\n^ \"Tiatr Personality JP Pereira\".

    "Classical Sunni tafsir of the Qur'an\nAl-Tashil li Ulum al-Tanzil (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0647\u064a\u0644_\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645_\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0646\u0632\u064a\u0644, romanized:\u00a0Facilitation of the Sciences of Revelation), better known as Tafsir Ibn Juzayy (Arabic: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062c\u064f\u0632\u064e\u064a\u0651), is a classical Sunni tafsir of the Qur'an, authored by the Maliki-Ash'ari scholar Ibn Juzayy.\nMethodology\nIn the science of tafsir, Ibn Juzayy's tafsir is among one of the greatest and most precise. He used a detailed approach to interpreting the Quran by the Quran, the Sunnah, or the interpretations of the Companions, distinguishing their preponderant viewpoints and the outweighing ones in the event of a disagreement. He also looked into the comments made by Quranic commentators, distinguishing between those that were authentic and those that weren't, as well as between the majority and minority views.\nFeatures\nThe tafsir and all other relevant sciences are found in this book. The author has chosen a wise path by providing a comprehensive but concise summary and outlining four purposes that contain four benefits: He discusses the four benefits in the introduction of his book:\n\u201cFirstly, citing a great number of statements of scholars in one small book to make it easier for the seekers of knowledge. The book includes the same information cited in the long references but briefly summarized and filtered with no room for redundancy ... I included all the Quranic sciences and the brief and most important conclusions, not the unneeded or irrelevant information.\nSecondly, I cited some anecdotes and subtle benefits that can be rarely found in any other book because they are the product of my wisdom, experience, and knowledge imparted to me by my teachers or the anecdotes cited in other books.\nThirdly, I keenly illustrated the problems either by addressing the problematic topics or by eliminating the possibilities and explaining the general points.\nFourthly, I verified the statements of past commentators of the Quran, identifying the authentic and inauthentic and the preponderant and the outweighed; this is because the opinions are of different levels (of authenticity); some are authentic and can be relied on as evidence, others are false and should simply be overlooked and rejected, and a third category includes those that are possibly authentic and possibly inauthentic. This possibility may be equal or not, and there are other levels in between as well. I classified the statements and opinions of scholars into different categories in order to identify each category easily marked with certain expressions indicating each of them; those declared false or void were referred to as 'weak or far-fetched', underlining that there are other preponderant, stronger, or most famous ones outweighing them and then citing the preponderant ones or remarking that 'such-and-such was said' so as not to attribute to anyone what he has not actually stated...\u201d\nBackground\nIbn Juzayy based his sources on a number of older sources, which include the following:\nAl-Kashshaaf by al-Zamakhshari (d. 538/1143).\nAl-Muharrar al-Wajiz fi Tafsir al-Kit\u0101b al-'Aziz by Ibn 'Atiyya (d. 541/1141 ).\nAbout the author\nIbn Juzayy was an influential Sunni scholar from Granada during the Andalusian period. He was a multidisciplinary scholar who specialized in scriptural exegesis, qira'at, Hadith, Islamic jurisprudence, Islamic theology, legal theory, Arabic, literature, and poetry. A major figure in the Maliki school, he is considered well-versed in many sciences and known for authoring quality books.\nSee also\nList of tafsir works\nList of Sunni books\nReferences\n^ Ibn Juzayy (22 June 2016).

    "Hungarian clan name\nNegol (Nygol) was the name of a minor gens (Latin for \"clan\"; nemzets\u00e9g in Hungarian) in the Kingdom of Hungary, which possessed lands in the southern parts of Transdanubia, mainly Baranya County.\nHistory\nTheir origin is unknown. They possessed lands north of Kisasszonyfa, where they erected a Premonstratensian abbey called K\u0151r\u00f6s Monastery (Hungarian: K\u0151r\u00f6smonostora) and later \"Insula Lazari\". Their nearest neighbor in the region was the N\u00e9meti clan.\nThe most prestigious member of the kindred was Batiz, who married Ahalyz, a French noblewoman and lady-in-waiting of Queen Yolanda de Courtenay, the second wife of King Andrew II of Hungary. Batiz served as isp\u00e1n of Moson County between 1219 and 1221. Following this, he functioned as head of Szolnok County in 1221. He was appointed Judge royal in the very end of 1222. Beside that he also served as isp\u00e1n of B\u00e9k\u00e9s County from 1222 to 1224, his death. Later, his widow married Solomon Atyusz then Bertrand Baj\u00f3ti. Batiz and Ahalyz also possessed lands in Valk\u00f3 County. When File Miskolc and his brothers were granted the estates Heyreh and Luder in the county in 1244, Ahalyz and her third husband claimed that the late Batiz donated both estates to her, but B\u00e9la IV rejected their statement. Batiz had a son Martin (possibly from his first marriage), who sued a certain B\u00f6k\u00e9ny (B\u00fcken) regarding the estates Heyreh and Luder in 1240, claiming that B\u00f6k\u00e9ny lost these estates of his family, in spite of the guarantee given earlier. As the conclusion of the lawsuit, Endre N\u00e9meti compensated Martin with 100 marks on behalf of his father-in-law B\u00f6k\u00e9ny.\nAside from Batiz and his son, the earliest members of the clan were Lawrence (I) and Bereve, who acted as arbiters during a lawsuit over an estate between \u00d3cs\u00e1rd and Baksa, commissioned by Palatine Stephen Gutkeled in 1247.\nBatiz had a brother (or at least a paternal relative) Nicholas. In 1267, he acted as a royal commissioner when some castle warriors of the fort Kov\u00e1szd were willing to subjugate themselves to the Dominican nunnery of Rabbits' Island. Nicholas had a daughter Barbara, who married Thomas Gy\u0151r from his clan's Baranya branch. She was a widow by 1308, when handed over a third portion of G\u00f6nc\u00f6l estate (her dowry) to Peter, son of \u00d3csa, the husband of her daughter Clara. Barbara inherited the land from her late husband.\nFamily tree\nN\nBatiz (fl. 1219\u20131224) \u221e (1) unknown (2) Ahalyz N\n(1) Martin (fl. 1240)\nNicholas (fl. 1267)\nBarbara (fl. 1308) \u221e Thomas Gy\u0151r\nK\u0151r\u00f6s branch\nDuring the era of Interregnum, the K\u0151r\u00f6sis, the only surviving branch of the Negol clan supported the claim of Charles I of Hungary. The powerful K\u0151szegi family, which extended their influence over Transdanubia, pillaged their estates in K\u0151r\u00f6s in 1316. Three years later, in 1319, John and Thaddeus, the sons of the aforementioned Thomas Gy\u0151r and Barbara Negol sued their relatives, John and Lawrence (II) \u2013 the sons of Lampert K\u0151r\u00f6si \u2013, demanding their mothers' daughters' quarter from them.

    "Scottish physician and nutrition scientist\nBruce Milligan Nicol (born 24 March 1913 in Ayrshire died 29 November 1988) was a Scottish physician and nutrition scientist. He researched and published extensively on Nigerian foods and nutrition.\nBiography and career\nNicol had his primary and secondary school education at Edinburgh Academy where he excelled at learning, cricket, and rugby football. He qualified as a physician from University of Aberdeen in 1935. In his immediate postgraduate career he worked for Professors James Learmonth and Stanley Davidson. When the latter moved to University of Edinburgh, Nicol went with him.\nWhile working with Davidson, Nicol's interests matured and focused on peptic ulcer disease. His clinical work and research were supplemented by a stint as a ship's surgeon. In this capacity, he obtained a wide exposure to medicine and his knowledge of ulcers was broaded through visits to hospitals in his ports of call in India and the Far East.\nIn 1936, he joined the 51st Highland Division as a Territorial Officer in the British Royal Corps of Signals. He was sent to France in a non-medical role at the outbreak of World War I. His qualifications in medicine did not go unnoticed and he was transferred to the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was awarded the Officer of the British Empire (Military Division) for his role at the Battle of Arnhem.\nIn 1947, Nicol transferred to the Colonial Medical Service and was assigned to Nigeria where he spent two decades as a doctor and nutritionist. As a District Medical Officer in Northern Nigeria, he became interested in Nigerian foods and food production. As a result, he conducted extensive studies into the staple food of different Nigerian groups and published eight substantial journal articles on the subject in the British Journal of Nutrition alone.\nAfter Nigeria achieved political independence from Britain, Nicol joined the Food and Agriculture Organization. His first assignment was as a Liaison Officer with UNICEF in New York. While there, he made significant contributions to the understanding of the Alfatoxin problem in tropically grown groundnuts and its role in the genesis of liver cancer.

    "NFL labor union\nThe National Football League Referees Association (NFLRA), established in 1972 as the Professional Football Referees Association is a labor union that serves as the collective bargaining agency for game officials with the National Football League (NFL).\nThe NFLRA has been involved in two work stoppages, lock outs taking place in 2001 and 2012. Its members are currently under contract with the league in a collective bargaining agreement signed in September 2019 and running through May 2026.\nOrganizational history\nBackground\nEstablishment\nIn July 1966, ahead of a regularly scheduled clinic for game officials employed by the National Football League (NFL) in Chicago, referee Stan Javie announced that an effort would be made to organize a trade union to bargain for higher game fees paid to officials by the league for working its games. An opposing faction, headed by referee Tommy Bell also emerged at this meeting, who made the argument that increases in game fees could be won without establishment of a union. After protracted discussion and debate, a vote was taken and by a count of 34 to 17 the decision was made to establish a collective bargaining unit, financed by dues payments of $50 per member per year. A five-member negotiating committee was named to go to New York to meet with league commissioner Pete Rozelle, the representative of team owners.\nFurther organizing effort was made at the annual NFL officials' clinic held in 1968 in Denver, when 53 NFL game officials were joined by 34 officials from the American Football League (AFL), which was scheduled to merge with the NFL following the 1969 football season. The game officials of the two leagues remained in informal contact through 1971. Early in March 1972 the organization was formally incorporated following a meeting in St. Louis as the \"Professional Football Referees Corporation.\" This name was subsequently changed to \"Professional Football Referees Association\". Ed Marion was selected as president of the new organization, and executive officers and a five-person board of directors named.\nAlthough the position of \"referee\" is very specific under football rules, one of five officials specified under article 2 of NFL rule 13, an error by the lawyer drawing up the articles of incorporation rendered the name of the group as \"Professional Football Referees Association\" (PFRA). This imprecise moniker remained unchanged until 2000. The union was registered as a non-profit organization in 1975.\nAt the time of the organization's formation, professional game officials received payment from the league ranging from $250 to $500 per game according to the NFL league office \u2014 an amount equating to $3,500 to $7,000 per year for a 14-game season. Officials selected to work games in the post-season made $700 in the first round of the playoffs, $1,000 in the conference championships, and $1,500 for working the Super Bowl.\nPension benefits\nIn 1974, President Ed Marion was given a lifetime appointment to a new position, that of executive director, with another person elected president. Over further objection by a minority faction organized by Tommy Bell, a campaign was launched for the establishment of pensions for retired officials. Marion was allowed to make a presentation to the 1974 annual owners' meeting in Florida, which was met sympathetically, with the result that an annual pension of $200 per month was granted to any officials retiring after the 1974 NFL season.\nThis concession did not grant pension benefits back to the establishment of the informal united organization in 1968, however, and the union's membership voted to retroactively self-fund a similar benefit for the ten officials who had retired in the interim. Every official was assessed fees totaling $400 between 1974 and 1978 and union initiation fees increased from $150 to $250 by 1984 to fund this supplemental pension, which continued to be paid out until the death of the last member of the affected group in 2009.\nThe 1994 contract\n2001 work stoppage\nMain article: 2001 NFL referee lockout\n2012 work stoppage\nMain article: 2012 NFL referee lockout\nThe union today\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f Dale Hamer, Scott Green, and Jeff Triplette (eds.), PFRA/NFLRA History: Professional Football Referees Association (1972\u20132000) and National Football League Referees Association (2000\u2013date), National Football League Referees Association, via www.nflra.com/, version of April 2024, p. 1.\n^ United Press International, \"Pro Grid Refs Now Organized,\" Jacksonville  Journal-Courier, April 4, 1972, p. 10.\n^ \"Sports in Short: Professional Football Referees Corp.

    "Emily Sargent, c. 1877, by her brother John Singer Sargent\nEmily Sargent (1857\u20131936) was an artist best known for her watercolors and the sister of John Singer Sargent. She did not exhibit her own work during her lifetime. But 440 of her works were discovered in 1998 in a trunk in a family residence. Many of these works have been given to some of the world's best known museums, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (45 paintings), the Tate Gallery (29), the National Gallery of Art (25), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (22), the Brooklyn Museum (20), the Ashmolean Museum (19), as well as the Sargent House Museum (15) in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where several of her ancestors lived.\nSargent at her easle, as painted by her brother John\nThe first major exhibition of her work Emily Sargent, A Glimpse into her World was held at the Cape Ann Museum in Gloucester, Massachusetts in 2022.\nEarly life\nEmily Sargent was a descendant of Epes Sargent, a colonial military leader and jurist. Her father, FitzWilliam (b. 1820 in Gloucester, Massachusetts), was an eye surgeon at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia from 1844 to 1854.  Her mother, Mary Newbold Sargent (n\u00e9e Singer, 1826\u20131906), suffered a breakdown after the death of her first child, and the couple decided to go abroad to recover. They were nomadic expatriates for the rest of their lives. Sargent's parents were based in Paris, but moved regularly, spending time at the sea and at mountain resorts in France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.\nWhile Mary was pregnant with her son, John Singer Sargent, they stopped in Florence, Tuscany, because of a cholera epidemic. John was born there in 1856. A year later, his sister Emily was born, also in Italy. After her birth, FitzWilliam resigned his post in Philadelphia and accepted his wife's request to remain abroad. They lived on a small inheritance and savings, leading a quiet life with their children. They generally avoided society and other Americans, except for friends in the art world. Three more children were born abroad, of whom only two lived past childhood.\nAt age four, Emily Sargent had a serious spinal injury, followed by a prolonged immobilization, resulting in lifelong frailty. Nevertheless, she traveled and painted throughout Europe and the Near East. Their mother made sure that all the children learned to draw and paint.\nEmily and John were close and both lived in Europe most of their lives, often traveling together. Neither married or had children, and Emily sometimes served as his hostess and helped him with his clients.\nDonated to the Met in 1950 by the Sargent family and attributed to John Singer Sargent. Now attributed to Emily Sargent\nView of Constantinople (1904)\nReferences\n^ a b c Cascone, Sarah (5 February 2023). \"Emily Sargent, Not Just a Sister to John, Was a Serious Painter in Her Own Right\".

    "Self-governing District of Brno in South Moravian Region, Czech Republic\nBrno-Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec is one of the 29 self-governing districts of Brno, Czech Republic, located in the southwestern part of the city. It consists of the urban district of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec (German: Neu Leskau, lit. 'New L\u00edskovec')), originally a settlement of the municipality of L\u00edskovec, with which it was annexed to Brno in 1919. The total cadastral area is 1.65 km\u00b2, and since the change of its boundary in 2012, it consists of almost the entire cadastral territory of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec and a small part of the cadastral territory of Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec. The self-governing district was established on November 24, 1990. About 10,000 people live here.\nBrno-Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec is adjacent to the district of Brno-Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec in the south and southeast. For the purposes of the senate elections, Brno-Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec is included in electoral district number 59 of the Brno-City District.\nHistory\nThe oldest settlement and Middle Ages\nThe advantageous location of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec at the foot of Kamenn\u00fd vrch has attracted prehistoric man to permanent settlement since the early Stone Age. During the construction of the panel housing estate in 1978, during the construction of the western highway feeder in 1971 and the \"Prague Radials\" in 1989, a large number of documents were found of extensive settlements of the linear pottery culture and Moravian painted ceramics, the Jordanian culture from the beginning of the late Stone Age, and Jevi\u0161ovice culture from the early Iron Age. A ditch delimiting the settlement of the oldest farmers was also found here. In 1978, during the construction of roads and a panel housing estate, 10 settlement pits with traces of the linear pottery culture were discovered. In the same locality, an buried object of the Jordanian culture was also found. In the Middle Ages, with a high probability of the territory of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec, the settlement of Rybn\u00edky, permanently belonging to the provostship in Kom\u00e1rov, was located in the place of today's Rybnick\u00e1 street. The settlement disappeared as a result of the Hussite or Czech-Hungarian wars. The land here was then used by subjects from Star\u00e9 Brno, Nov\u00e9 Sady, Trn\u00edt\u00e1, Kom\u00e1rov, Horn\u00ed Her\u0161pice, Bohunice, L\u00edskovec and Bosonohy. In 1528, the last provost of Kom\u00e1rov handed over this desolate settlement to the chapter of St. Peter in Brno.\n19th Century to the 1970s\nThe modern cadastre of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec was originally mainly part of the cadastres of the municipalities of L\u00edskovec and Bohunice; a small part in the southwest (310 m\u00b2) belonged to Bosonohy. Before the creation of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec, orchards and vineyards were located on its territory. The beginnings of the settlement of today's Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec date back to 1894, when Anton\u00edn Hrazd\u00edra, a carpenter from Blanen, built a house here without the knowledge of the village of L\u00edskovec. In 1896, after negotiations, he obtained an additional building permit. Soon, more houses began to be added here, but only in the part that then belonged to L\u00edskovec, while the originally Bohunice part was not built until 1919, because the municipality of Bohunice at that time did not want to allow construction there. The first proposals for the name of the newly emerging settlement, popularly called L\u00edskove\u010dky, included Mal\u00fd L\u00edskovec, Ti\u0161lerky or L\u00edsk\u00e1\u010dek.\nIn 1906, the builder Uherka, in cooperation with the businessman B\u00edlek and other companies, began to build more houses here. Germans from Brno showed the greatest interest in housing here. Therefore, in the same year, several Czech residents founded a local branch of National Unity for Southwestern Moravia in order to defend against the Germanisation of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec. A school was opened here in 1907. In 1910, the settlement already had 117 houses with 568 inhabitants. A significant moment for Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec was the construction of the connecting road between Pis\u00e1rky and Jihlavsk\u00e1 road in the years 1911\u20131914.\nOn April 16, 1919, the villages of L\u00edskovec and Bohunice were annexed to Brno, which lifted the building restrictions in the Bohunice part. After that, the development of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec also extended to the northwest of the original Bohunice cadastre. In the 1930s, the construction of the two-story \"semi-detached houses\" was completed. During World War II, the following inhabitants of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec died or were executed by the Gestapo: Old\u0159ich Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Stanislav Kluch, Franti\u0161ka Kluchov\u00e1, Franti\u0161ek Kluch, Vladim\u00edr Kluch, Vladislav Podsedn\u00edk, Jind\u0159ich \u0160koda, Josef Zoubek, Petr K\u0159ivka and Leopold Herman. At the end of World War II, during the liberation of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec, which began on April 25, 1945, 51 houses were heavily damaged and 91 houses were lightly damaged. A number of the residents of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec were also illegally convicted by the communist regime. Most of the modern cadastre of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec and Star\u00fd L\u00edskovec formed a common cadastre until the 1960s, when the cadastral territory of Nov\u00fd L\u00edskovec was created by sepa",

    "Not to be confused with Volosko or Alexey Voloskov.\nVoloska, sometimes dubbed Vlasta, is a Croatian and Slavic hearth pseudo-deity that has not been attested in historical sources on Slavic paganism. The first known published source that attests to Voloska is the 1943 book Hrvatska narodna mitologija (\"Croatian National Mythology\") by psychiatrist Nikola Su\u010di\u0107, which has been criticized by Croatian ethnologists as \"incorrectly assessing\" pagan myths and as unreliable due to a lack of sources.\nAccording to Su\u010di\u0107, Voloska was the spouse of Veles and the protector of agricultural workers, symbolized by a cow and a swallow. He claims that all Slavic homes featured an alcove (\"miri\u0161te\") where a small flame would be lit in Voloska's honor. This alcove would allegedly also include statuettes of Voloska made from wood, wax or amber.\nIn popular culture\nAfter the publishing of Su\u010di\u0107's book, Voloska was mentioned in the poems of Vladimir Nazor (\"Miti i legende\", 1948) and Boro Pavlovi\u0107 (\"Slavenska lipa\", 1960).\nCommonly cited publicist and movie director Franjo Ledi\u0107, whose interpretation of Slavic mythology was cited as \"romanticized\" by ethnologist Tea \u0160koki\u0107 and \"uncritical\" by Lidija Bajuk, wrote a chapter on Voloska based on the work of Su\u010di\u0107 and the previously mentioned poems.\nReferences\n^ Ledi\u0107 1969, p.\u00a0180.\n^ Gayatri Horvat, Irena (2014). \"U potrazi za \u017eenskim arhetipom: Slavenske i indijske boginje\"  (PDF).

    "German politician (1921\u20131990)\nAlfred Rohde (21 April 1921 \u2013 30 January 1990) was a German politician and party functionary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as the longtime First Secretary of the SED at SDAG Wismut and was a member of the Central Committee of the SED. As First Secretary, he was a powerful leader in the GDR's most important mining company, the fourth largest uranium producer in the world.\nHe committed suicide in January 1990, having lost power in the Peaceful Revolution.\nLife and career\nEarly career\nRohde was born as the son of a locksmith and a factory worker. He attended elementary and vocational school until Easter 1935. Between April 1935 and February 1939, he trained as a machinist and subsequently worked in this profession in Dresden from March 1939 to October 1940 and in Leipzig from October 1940 to March 1942.\nFrom March 1942 to May 1945, he served in the Wehrmacht. From May to September 1945, Rohde was held as a British prisoner of war in Schleswig-Holstein. After his release, he worked again as a machinist in Dresden until December 1950.\nIn September 1945, he joined the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany) in 1945, which was forcibly merged with the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) to form the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany) in 1946. Additionally, he joined the FDGB (Free German Trade Union Federation) in 1946.\nFrom 1946 to 1950, he was the chairman of the BGL (company trade union leadership) and, after attending the state party school \"Ernst Th\u00e4lmann\" in Mei\u00dfen, served as secretary of the SED party organization at VEB Universelle-Werke, a factory making machines for the production of cigarettes, from January to November 1951 and as a member of an SED city district leadership in Dresden.\nFrom December 1951 to June 1952, he was the head of the organization and instructor department of the Dresden SED and from July 1952 to February 1953, the head of the department for party organs and mass organizations of the Dresden-Land SED.\nFrom February 1953 to September 1955, he participated in the first three-year course at the \"Karl Marx\" Party Academy. He graduated with a diploma in social sciences (Dipl.-Ges.-Wiss.). From November 1955 to June 1966, he subsequently worked as an instructor in the party organs department and as a political staff member in the Central Committee of the SED.\nSDAG Wismut SED\nFormer SDAG Wismut SED building in Chemnitz in August 2008\nIn 1969, Rohde was transferred to the Soviet-German joint-stock company (SDAG) Wismut SED as Second Secretary, succeeding G\u00fcnter Eichmann, who left to study at the Bergakademie Freiberg.\nThe SDAG Wismut SED party organization, titled territorial party leadership (German: Gebietsparteileitung), held the rank of a Bezirk party organization, unlike all other industrial party organizations, as SDAG Wismut was a massive mining undertaking with dozens of locations. It was described as a \"state within a state\".\nIn December 1970, First Secretary Kurt Kie\u00df surprisingly died at the age of 56. Rohde was elected to succeeded him in February 1971. He additionally became a full member of the Central Committee of the SED in June (VIII. Party Congress), serving until its collective resignation in December 1989, and of the Volkskammer in November, nominally representing a constituency in the Ore Mountains in Bezirk Karl-Marx-Stadt.\nRohde was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in bronze in 1968, in silver and in Gold in 1986, the Order of Karl Marx in 1981, the Banner of Labor in 1984 and the Order of Lenin.\nPeaceful Revolution and Death\nDuring the Wende, on 12 November 1989, the SDAG Wismut SED removed him from the position of First Secretary and installed his longtime deputy Heinz Freitag as his successor. Freitag led the party organization until its dissolution in December. He was removed by his party from the Volkskammer a week later, on 16 November 1989.\nRohde committed suicide on 30 January 1990.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i j \"Rohde, Alfred\". www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de.

    "Dey of Algiers\nIbrahim Kouchouk, also known as Ibrahim el Seghir or Ibrahim IV, was the 15th ruler and Dey of Algiers. He ruled for 15 years after his predecessor Baba Abdi.\nRule\nHis predecessor Ibrahim ben Ramdan, who suffered from dysentery, elected his nephew and Khaznadar (treasurer) as his successor and abdicated on October 20, 1745. \nIbrahim was 45 years old when he was first elected. The Dey first agreed on a peace treaty with the Danish Kingdom, paying an annual tribute with military equipment, and maintained good relations with the Kingdom of France.\nShortly after sitting on the throne, he would launch an expedition to the Regency of Tunis against the Bey Ali I Pasha, after attacking his neighbor Tripoli, and also ally of the Dey, and even told him to commit suicide. The Algerians entered the territory on April 6th, 1746. On their way the army had been reinforced by the troops of the Beylik of Constantine and indigenous Arabs. After putting the city of El Kef under siege, peace was quickly achieved thanks to the submissions that Ali made, and the need of Ibrahim to take his troops to Constantine.\nAfter the Dey's return to Algiers, he had to face another rebellion in Tlemcen by the Kouloughlis of the Western Beylik, who dreamed of the reformation of the Kingdom of Tlemcen. Ibrahim mobilised his entire army against them and eventually defeated them, but ended up ordering the massacre of more of them, after their intentions of overthrowing the government of Algiers were confirmed.\nHe eventually died after being poisoned by the Kouloughlis. His khodjet al khil (Minister of Horses) Mohamed Ibn Bekir was elected as his succesor.\nReferences\n^ Garrot, Henri (1910). Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Alg\u00e9rie (in French). Impr. P.

    "Historic kopitiam in Singapore\nThe Chin Mee Chin Confectionery (Chinese: \u771f\u7f8e\u73cd, colloquially known as CMC) is a historic kopitiam (coffee shop) in Katong, Singapore. Located at 204 East Coast Road, Chin Mee Chin started out as bread delivery business in the 1920s by Hainanese native Tan Hui Dong before becoming a kopitiam in 1925 by renting 204 East Coast Road. The business would be taken over by Hui Dong's son Tan Joo Long in 1947 following his father's death in Sook Ching. The younger Tan expanded the business by serving other foodstuff and fully purchasing the building as well as giving the name 'Chin Mee Chin' (meaning \"genuine, beautiful treasures\" in Chinese). Following a surge of Eurasians living in the Joo Chiat area during the 1970s, Chin Mee Chin decided to appeal to the Eurasians by serving Eurasian confectionary, which would later become staples on their menu. In 2021, Food and beverages company Ebb & Flow acquired Chin Mee Chin and revived it after it was closed down in 2018 due to a lack of manpower and succession.\nThe Chin Mee Chin Confectionery building has a blue fa\u00e7ade.\nHistory\nChin Mee Chin Confectionery was started in the 1920s as an unnamed bread delivery business by Tan Hui Dong, a native of Keng Hai county, Hainan Island. Tan (along with his clansmen) delivered bread to Peranakan households in the Joo Chiat area. In 1925, Tan became a shareholder of a building owned by Hainanese proprietors on East Coast Road for his business, which would later become the Chin Mee Chin Confectionery Shop. However, Tan died in February 1942 during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. He was rounded up by Japanese soldiers after leaving his home to acquire new documentation from the Japanese Empire. Following his death, the business was ran by Tan's clansmen.\nThe business was taken over by Tan's son (then aged 25), Tan Joo Long (alternatively spelled as Tan Joon Ling) in 1947 after arriving from Hainan island. He named his father's business 'Chin Mee Chin Confectionery' (Chinese for \"genuine, beautiful treasures\"). The younger Tan expanded the business by serving other cake, pastries, and buns as well as purchasing the building that Chin Mee Chin was renting from the owners for the business' longevity.\nDuring the 1970s, there was a growth of a Eurasian community in the Joo Chiat area. To attract Eurasians to the kopitiam, Chin Mee Chin started serving Eurasian confectionary such as sugee cakes and cream horns.\nOn 25 July 2009, Tan Joo Long died at the age of 87, according to his son William Tan Chiew Duan.\nIn 2018, Chin Mee Chin Confectionery closed down due to a lack of manpower and succession.\nIn 2021, Food and beverages company Ebb & Flow Group revived and took over the Chin Mee Chin Confectionery. Co-founder and chief executive officer of Ebb & Flow Chun Lim Kian grew up on the street behind the bakery, and was neighbors with the Tan family. Negotiations with the Tan family began in January 2020 and ended on July of the same year. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, the opening was delayed to March 2021. It was further delayed until 15 September of the same year as contrary to the popular belief of construction issues, it was actually gastronomical issues that delayed the opening, with Chun saying that \u201cHonestly, it was a lot harder than we thought it would be to recreate that old-school feel, ...there were no real recipes for the dishes so there was a lot of trial and error involved. We\u2019ve had to tweak some things to modernise them a bit\u2026 We\u2019ve expanded the kitchen because this is quite a large operation now and we\u2019ve also expanded the menu\u2026 so those things took time.\u201d\nNowadays, it is popular with worshipers of the nearby Church of the Holy Family, with many frequently patronising at Chin Mee Chin after Church services.\nDetails\nThe Chin Mee Chin confectionery is located at 204 East Coast Road in Katong, Marine Parade, Singapore. The physical building has a pale blue fa\u00e7ade with the \"iconic\" signboard of the business' name. It also has an alfresco section and a \"colourful retro-style mural\" on the exterior walls. The interior of the building has a mosaic green floor and wall tiles with a \"retro\" horse painting hanged on the wall. It has \"marble-topped tables\" and its \"classic coffee shop chairs\" that take up the front half of the shop as well as a \"five foot way facing the  church\". The kitchen has gone through several changes over Chin Mee Chin's history. When Tan Joo Long took over the business, he and his staff used bricks and a metal sheet found at the back of the shop to create a makeshift urn and oven. Chin Mee Chin also has a charcoal grill where they toast their buns. At some point before their closure, they stopped using it but it was brought back by Ebb & Flow.\nThe kopitiam is often noted for its kaya toast, a toast made from kaya, which is a jam made from coconut milk, eggs, and sugar. Chin Mee Chin's kaya has been described as \"Jade-hued\" as well as being \"not too sweet, n",
    "\nThe Greenland national futsal team is controlled by the Football Association of Greenland, the governing body for futsal in Greenland, and represents the country in international futsal competitions. It is not a member of FIFA or UEFA and can, therefore, not compete in official competitions of those governing bodies. The nation competes in open competitions such as the Nordic Futsal Cup and Futsal Week.\nHistory\nThe Football Association of Greenland assembled its-first ever national futsal team in November 2013 for two friendlies against the Faroe Islands in Nuuk. It was also the first time the Faroe Islands fielded an official futsal side. Frederik Funch scored his nation's first goal in the first match for the first-ever official goal in team history. Greenland went on to win both matches.\nGreenland participated in the Nordic Futsal Cup for the first time in the 2016 edition of the tournament. The association saw this as a major step toward UEFA and FIFA membership. After years of unsuccessful attempts to joing the European confederation, the KAK submitted its application to become a member of CONCACAF, the confederation governing North America, Central America, and the Caribbean, in May 2024. When accepted, Greenland would be eligible to participate in the confederation's competitions, including the CONCACAF Futsal Championship.\nFixtures and results\nMain article: Greenland national futsal team results\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\u00a0\u00a0Win\n\u00a0\u00a0Draw\n\u00a0\u00a0Loss\n\u00a0\u00a0Fixture\n2023\nDenmark\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nNorway\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nEstonia\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nEstonia\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\n2024\nSwitzerland\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nMalta\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nSan Marino\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nEstonia\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nLatvia\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nMontenegro\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nSlovenia\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nTurkey\u00a0 v \u00a0Greenland\nCurrent squad\nThe team plays its home matches at the Inussivik in Nuuk, Greenland\u2019s capital\nThe following players were called up for the 2023 Baltic-Nordic Futsal Cup.\nKarls Louis Sandgreen\nNiklas T.

    "K\u00f6nigstuhl 1 is a low-mass wide binary, 87 light-years distant from earth\nK\u00f6nigstuhl 1 (KO-1, K\u00f6 1, Koenigstuhl 1) is a binary consisting out of the red dwarf LEHPM 494 and the M- or L-type star or brown dwarf DENIS-P J0021.0-4244. While similar low-mass wide binary were known in young star-forming regions, K\u00f6nigstuhl1 was the first wide binary detected in the field and was not associated with a star-forming region.\nName and discovery\nThe individual components were known since 1998 (DENIS survey) and 2003 (LEHPM survey), but the binary status was not noticed until Jos\u00e9 A. Caballero studied them in 2007 and discovered that they move in the same direction. This similar motion was first revealed in the USNO-B1/NOMAD1 proper motion surveys. Caballero also collected 22 years of data to show that the proper motion is consistent. He named the pair K\u00f6nigstuhl 1 because he worked at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, which is located on top of the K\u00f6nigstuhl. Other low-mass binaries were discovered by Caballero in the Koenigstuhl survey and called Koenigstuhl 1, Koenigstuhl 2 (K\u00f6 2, K\u00f6 3). The last addition was Koenigstuhl 7 in 2014.\nThe binary\nIn the discovery paper Caballero reports a spectral type of M6V for the primary K\u00f6 1A and a mass of around 10% of the sun.\nThe spectral type of the secondary K\u00f6 1B was first estimated to be >M9V and later the optical spectral type was determined to be M9.5V. Caballero determined a mass of 79 to 87 MJ for the secondary. The binary components are separated by around 1800 astronomical units. This wide orbit also meant that the gravitational binding energy is very low for the binary. At this time one theory existed that explained the presence of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with the fragmentation and ejection of stellar embryos from molecular clouds. The presence of wide binaries in the field are hard to explain by such a scenario.\nThe infrared spectral type of K\u00f6 1B was determined to be L0.6: in 2014. The gravity on this object is consistent with other old field dwarfs. Later it was determined that K\u00f6 1 could be part of the 200 Myr old Carina Near Association. If this is true, K\u00f6 1B would be less massive and it would have a mass of 51.88\u00b13.6 MJ. A more precise separation of 2083.4 AU was reported in 2021 and K\u00f6 1B might have two components.\nSee also\nOther low-mass wide binaries:\n2MASS J11011926\u22127732383\nWISE 2150\u22127520\nSDSS J141624.08+134826.7\nUScoCTIO 108\nOph 162225-240515\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f Caballero, J.

    "\nAntoine Breguet (born in Paris on (1851-01-26)January 26, 1851 and died in Paris 1st on (1882-07-08)July 8, 1882), was a French physicist, the great-grandson of the watchmaker and physicist Abraham Breguet, son of physicist Louis Cl\u00e9ment Fran\u00e7ois Breguet (1804-1883), and father of aviation pioneers Louis Charles Breguet (1880-1955) and Jacques Eug\u00e8ne Henri Breguet (1881-1939). His daughter Madeleine Camille Breguet (1878-1900) married Jacques Bizet (1872-1922), son of composer Georges Bizet, in 1898 but died prematurely without descendants at the age of 21.\nBiography\nIn 1870, while still a student, Antoine Breguet was employed in the battalion of auxiliary miners of the engineering corps formed by chief mining engineer Eug\u00e8ne Jacquot to participate in the defense of the capital. Two years later, he entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, becoming the first member of his family to pursue higher education. After graduating from Polytechnique, he joined the family business.\nThe company, while maintaining its headquarters at the Quai de l'Horloge, had since 1872 workshops at 81, Boulevard du Montparnasse (6th arrondissement) better suited to its activities, which began to take on an industrial character. Antoine Breguet built the Gramme machine there and signed a treaty with Z\u00e9nobe Gramme in 1875. He then wrote a book on the theory of the Gramme machine, published in 1880. He constructed experimental and laboratory apparatus: electromagnets, induction coils, capacitors. He invented a recording anemometer powered by electricity in 1875 and a mercury telephone.\nIn 1881, he transformed the family watchmaking business into a public company under the name \"Maison Br\u00e9guet\" with the purpose of \"construction, installation, and trade\" of electrical equipment (telegraphy, telephony, signals, lighting, remote power transmission...) and with its headquarters at 37 , Quai de l'Horloge. On December 31 of the same year, Antoine Breguet, described as an \"engineer constructor,\" purchased from his father, in front of a notary, the \"business of constructing electrical appliances and precision instruments located at 39, Quai de l'Horloge, for the principal sum of 300000 francs.\"\nAt the same time, he launched the construction of new workshops at 19, Rue Didot in the Quartier de Plaisance (14th arrondissement) which he would not live to see completed (1822). Overworked, Antoine Breguet succumbed on July 8, 1882, at his residence at 4, Rue Perrault, to a cardiovascular accident. He was buried in the P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery (division 11).\nHe left behind his wife, Marie Dubois, aged 24, with three young children. The Maison Breguet was entrusted to its director, Gaston Sciama, until their majority.\nHonors\nFrench\nOfficer of Academy Palms\nForeign\nKnight of the Order of Leopold (Belgium)\n Commander of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (Spain)\nKnight of the Royal Order of the Polar Star (Sweden)\nNotes and references\n^ Paris, \u00c9tat civil reconstitu\u00e9, vue 28/51.\n^ Acte de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 Paris 1er, n\u00b0 692, vue 3/31.\n^ a b c Collectif, Gilles-Antoine Langlois (dir.), Montparnasse et le 14e arrondissement, 2000, p.170 (out of print, partially online) on the gallica.bnf.fr site.\n^ Christian Bozon, \u00ab\u00a0A la d\u00e9couverte de quelques inventeurs et de leurs instruments\u00a0\u00bb, In\u00a0: La Jaune et la Rouge, No.649, November 2009.\n^ \u00ab\u00a0A la d\u00e9couverte de quelques inventeurs et de leurs instruments\u00a0\u00bb, In\u00a0: La Jaune et la Rouge, No.676, June 2012.\n^ AN MC/ET/LVI/1024.\n^ AN MC/ET/LVI/1024.\n^ Annuaire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de Physique pour l'ann\u00e9e 1879.\n",

    "Peruvian political party\nThe National Alliance of Workers, Farmers, University Students and Reservists (Spanish: Alianza Nacional de Trabajadores, Agricultores, Universitarios, Reservistas y Obreros; ANTAURO), or just the National Alliance (Spanish: Alianza Nacional) is a Peruvian political party. Founded in 2023, it is led by Antauro Humala, leader of the Ethnocacerist movement.\nHistory\nFollowing the 2021 general election, Union for Peru (UPP) lost its political registration, leaving the Ethnocacerism without a political vehicle. On 20 August 2022, the leader of the movement, Antauro Humala, was released from prison after 15 years imprisoned due to the Andahuaylazo. He recognized his plans to register two parties in order to compete in the upcoming presidential election: the United Revolutionary Ethnocacerist Party (PERU) and the ANTAURO itself. On 11 January 2023 he submitted the required signatures to register the party.\nIn September 2023, a private citizen filed a challenge against the imminent registration of the ANTAURO, contending that its leader, Humala, praises the Revolutionary Junta of Juan Velasco Alvarado and supports terrorism, thereby posing a threat to Peruvian democracy. However, on 7 December 2023, the National Jury of Elections (JNE)dismissed the complaint, asserting that Humala did not officially hold any leadership position within the party. Ultimately, the ANTAURO was registered on 12 December 2023 with Marco Antonio Vizcarra, another participant in the Andahuaylazo, as the president and former UPP congressman Rub\u00e9n Ramos Zapata as the legal official.\nAmid widespread concern regarding the party's registration, Prime Minister Alberto Ot\u00e1rola declared his intention to request authorities to investigate the party's ideology, aiming to determine its commitment to democratic principles. Additionally, Congressman Carlos Anderson proposed legislation to prohibit individuals convicted of homicide from assuming the presidency in Peru, a measure designed to preempt any potential presidential candidacy by Humala in the forthcoming 2026 Presidential election.\nIdeology\nMain article: Ethnocacerism\nThe party's acronym is named after its leader, which has led to the party be deemed as a surrogate, which has been rejected by Humala. The party's main ideology is ethnocacerism, which mixes racial superiority of the 'copper skinned' with anti-Chilean rhetoric and has been described as a form of Andean fascism. Nevertheless, in January 2023, Antauro Humala was denounced for praising the Peruvian communist guerrilla group Shining Path.\nThe ANTAURO has strongly criticized the release of former President Alberto Fujimori,adopting an overtly Anti-Fujimorist rhetoric in its campaign. According to political analysts, Humala has recently sought to cast himself as the 'Peruvian Bukele', seemingly attempting to position himself as an authoritative leader. In its statute, the ANTAURO advocates for the restoration of the mandatory military service.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Antauro Humala presenta firmas ante el Jurado Nacional de Elecciones para inscribir nuevo partido pol\u00edtico - Caretas Pol\u00edtica\".

    "Australian boxer (born 2001)\nNikolai Terteryan (born 19 June 2001) is an Armenian-born Danish boxer. He won the gold medal in the light middleweight event the 2023 European Games in Krak\u00f3w, which qualified him for the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.\nAmateur career\nTerteryan trains at BK Wedala in Vejle, won silver at the 2015 European Schoolboys Championships in Anapa and was also a participant in the 2016 Junior European Championships in Kaposv\u00e1r, the 2018 Youth World Championships in Budapest and the 2018 Youth European Championships in Roseto and 2019 in Sofia.\nAt the 2020 European Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament in London, which was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and continued in Paris in 2021, Terteryan won the opening round against the Kosovar Shp\u00ebtim Bajoku, but lost in the round of 16 to the Belarusian Dzmitry Asanau.

    "United States historic place\nThe Austin Pass Warming Hut was constructed in 1940 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The Washington Junior Company 2915, was based at Camp F-12 near Glacier. Other contributions include 43 miles (69\u00a0km) of truck roads, the Glacier Ranger Station, four lookouts and 100 miles (160\u00a0km) of trail. The Austin Pass Warming Hut represents the Region 6 rustic style. The building is a fine example of CCC work. It's Region 6 rustic style includes: irregular plan, roof and porch projections, intersecting gables, dormers, multi-paned windows, and variations in exterior texture. The use of native wood and stone are a fine example. The columnar andesite veneer in the first floor walls is a figurative link to the rock on which it stands. The use of vertical siding moves the eye to the roof peak, linking the building to the surrounding peaks. Non-contributing structures include the radio mast, flagpole, propane tanks and septic tank.\nAppearance\nThe Warming Hut is a two and one-half story masonry and wood-frame building located in a subalpine habitat at 4,440 feet (1,350\u00a0m).  The area is surrounded by scattered mountain hemlock and Pacific silver fir. The building is rest atop a knob of columnar andesite, with a sharp drop into the Bagley Lakes basins. A parking lot for about 16 cars is located just to the south.  When originally constructed, the Warming Hut had a T plan, facing the northwest. The steeply-pitched, cross-gabled roof is covered with cedar shakes. The roof and a gabled dormer extend beyond the front to create a wide porch. The porch has a flagstone floor with the main entrance in the center. The second entrance is on the southeast elevation. A third entrance, now the primary (2024) is located on the second-story porch in the south angle. Windows are surrounded by quarter-pole trim. The chimney is made of courses of columnar andesite. The first-floor walls are concrete with an exterior masonry veneer of coursed, rough-cut columnar andesite. The second floor and gables are covered with horizontal ten-inch clapboard siding. In the southeast gable and the northwest dormer the boards are placed vertically.  A chevron pattern is used below the dormer windows.\nThe Warming Hut was constructed as a ski shelter, supporting the development by the Mt. Baker Development Company. The interior included a large warming room, waxing and drying room, and sleeping loft. It also contained either a lunch room or kitchen at different times. The warming room was finished with knotty pine paneling.  The large massive fireplace is made from rough-cut columnar andesite.\nThe Warming Hut was not functional. Heavy snowfall made it difficult to maintain supplies, which had to be skied in. During the Second World War, the State highway department discontinued plowing of the road. After the war, difficulties delayed the return of a ski area until the late 1950s.\nIn 1972, the University of Washington used the Warming Hut as a field station. The first floor was modified with the removal of rest rooms partitions to accommodate electric generation equipment. The second floor saw the main room divided into four bedrooms, a toilet, and a living area. The food service area was remodeled by installing a drop ceiling, removal of the knotty pine paneling, replacing both the ceiling and walls with drywall. The original andesite fireplace located in the living area remained intact.\nOn the exterior, modifications were less extensive. A single-story room with a flat roof was added to house a 2000-gallon diesel storage tank. The walls are concrete with a coursed andesite veneer. Clapboard was used on the upper part of the walls. A pair of 1,200 US gallons (4,500\u00a0L) propane tanks are 50 feet (15\u00a0m) south of the Warming Hut, and a concrete septic tank, is  located 50 feet (15\u00a0m)  feet north.  The Warming Hut was used as housing for Forest Service work crews. During the University of Washington or recent Forest Service occupation, a metal radio mast was added to the southeast elevation, and a flagpole placed in the south angle. In 2024, the building is the Heather Meadows Visitor Center.\nBibliography\nHeller, Ramon, 1980 Mount Baker Ski Area: A Pictorial History. Mt.

Along with exhibitions, the Gallery 91 exhibition programme included discussions, demonstrations and poetry evenings. To cater for these activities the Gallery's hours were long: 9.30am \u2013 5.30pm and 7pm \u2013 11pm on weekdays and on Saturday from 7pm \u2013 11pm. Home and Building magazine described the gallery as, \u201ca stylish, large and open exhibition space, Gallery 91 seemed to declare that New Zealand art was something of value and that its practitioners should be respected. The emphasis was on younger artists and the programme included loan exhibitions from the Auckland City Art Gallery including Contemporary New Zealand Drawings.\nAmong the many exhibitions shown, one stands out: the largest exhibition of Colin McCahon's paintings shown up to that time in Christchurch. Art critic and McCahon biographer Peter Simpson has named it, \u2018the most remarkable exhibition of new paintings McCahon ever held\u2019. Christchurch City Librarian and art collector Ron O\u2019Reilly started a campaign to buy the painting Tomorrow will be the same but not as this is to gift to the Robert McDougall Art Gallery. This first attempt failed but the idea was successfully revived three years later. Lack of sustained sales forced the Brookes to close Gallery 91 after ten months.\nCanterbury Society of Arts\nIn January 1960 Andr\u00e9 and Barbara Brooke were jointly appointed as Secretary Manager of the Canterbury Society of Arts. The reaction from the artworld was enthusiastic, \u201cone-man shows and other exhibitions by small groups of artists will inevitably result in a change of emphasis\u201d. The couple brought to the CSA's Canterbury Society of Arts Durham Street premises a range of younger artists and initiated high-profile exhibitions such as the Hay's Limited Art Competition (later known as the Hay's Art Prize).\u00a0 Andr\u00e9 Brooke resigned from the position in 1963 and Barbara was appointed as the sole Secretary Manager of the Canterbury Society of Arts. She remained in the job for the next two years with  early work on planning for the construction of a new building for the CSA.\nCaxton Press and Ascent\nAfter leaving the CSA, in 1966 Barbara Brooke was employed part-time at Caxton Press to edit the New Zealand Local Government Magazine. The following year, at the suggestion of the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council, Leo Bensemann and Brooke started up a new magazine for contemporary art, Ascent. For the first two issues Brooke is listed as \u2018assistant editor\u2019 but by issue three she is noted as co-editor alongside Bensemann. Ross Fraser reviewed the first issue in Landfall. Push the writers \u201cextend\u201d them with critical writers who also provide feedback \u2013 positive or otherwise \u2013 to our artists.  Five issues of Ascent were published before it closed in 1969. The following October Barbara Brooke and Andr\u00e9 Brooke were divorced and he left New Zealand to live in Tahiti.\nMollet Street Market\nIn 1972 Brooke helped open Christchurch's first craft market with Judy Gifford and others. The Mollet Street Market was located at 601B Colombo Street and described itself as a \u2018craft-display workshop with gear on sale to the public.\u2019 The success of the market was over-shadowed when the Retail Shop Assistants\u2019 Union took Brooke and her co-workers to court on the grounds of staff having to work in the week-ends\u201d Brooke helped start a partition to allow the market to continue and eventually managed win an exemption via the courts. Brooke also demonstrated her engagement in local politics when she stood for and was appointed to the Christchurch Transport Board where she served from 1975 to 1978. \u00a0\nBrooke Gifford Gallery\nBrooke's return to the contemporary art dealer business came in 1975 when she and her friend Judith Gifford opened the Brooke Gifford Gallery at 112 Manchester Street. One of the first exhibitions was in co-operation with Barry Lett Galleries in Auckland and included Ralph Hotere and Patrick Hanly. Many of the exhibitions during Brooke's time at the gallery demonstrated her determination to bring the latest of contemporary art practice to Christchurch. A significant example was a 1979 Billy Apple exhibition in which the work consisted of renovating the gallery's print room ",
    "French journalist and author (born 1969)\n\u00c8ve Charrin (born 1969 in Lyon) is a French journalist, literary critic and author.\nBiography\nShe first wrote in the economic press (Challenges, occasionally Alternatives \u00e9conomiques). She also contributes to the magazine Esprit and to La Quinzaine litt\u00e9raire, including a column, \"Zone de turbulences\", until 2016.\nShe then wrote very regularly in the pages \"Id\u00e9es\" and \"Culture\" of Marianne and in the magazine Books, where she hosted a column.\nShe has also published in L'Obs, in the magazine XXI (investigations on Pascal Lamy, on the City of London, on the relationship to work; major interviews with Arundhati Roy, David Graeber), as well as in the magazine Le Crieur.\nWriting\nIn 2007, after a three-year stay in New Delhi, she published L'Inde \u00e0 l\u2019assaut du monde (Grasset). This investigative essay shows that the unequal nature of Indian society, marked by the caste system, does not hinder the country's economic emergence (as measured by GDP). With its educated and English-speaking elites, early 21st-century India is indeed benefiting from globalization by exporting its high value-added services (particularly IT) at competitive prices.\nShe subsequently devoted herself to literature of the real, with La Voiture du Peuple et le sac Vuitton (2013), a collection of essays and fictions on globalization seen through 15 objects, La Course ou la Ville, an on-board story-report on delivery drivers. She continues her publications with Journal Intime du capitalisme, an autobiographical story about the contradictions between her convictions in matters of social justice and ecology, and her early career in the economic press acquired to neoliberalism, then Glissement de Terrain, a literary story about the fight for the defense of the Jardins ouvri\u00e8res des Vertus in Aubervilliers.

During her tenure as ambassador to Madagascar, in May 2022, China donated 3000 books consisting of children's versions of Chinese classical novels and books about traditional Chinese culture, for the opening of a reading room at school Le Petit Nid in Antananarivo. In April 2023, China Eximbank has announced that it will grant a $240 million preferential credit to finance the construction of the Ranomafana hydroelectric power station, with Sinohydro poised to construct it. Guo described it as \"the largest financing cooperation project between China and Madagascar since the establishment of diplomatic relations.\" Guo's tenure as ambassador to Madagascar ended in September 2023.\nAmbassador to Estonia (2023-present)\nIn September 2023, Guo was appointed as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of Estonia and in October 2023, she presented her credentials to President of Estonia Alar Karis.\nIn November 2023, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Estonia announced that it would allow Taiwan to set up a representative office of Taiwan in Estonia. Following the announcement, in a meeting with the chairman of the Estonia-China parliamentary group Toomas Kivim\u00e4gi on November 9 regarding the plans for establishment of the representative office and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan Joseph Wu's unofficial visit to Estonia a day earlier, Guo warned that if the plans to open a representative office of Taiwan goes ahead, she would leave Estonia, with Kivim\u00e4gi describing the matter as \"serious problem and challenge.\"\nIn May 2024, following the meeting of Estonia politician Juku-Kalle Raid, who is also the chairman of the Tibetan support group in Riigikogu, with the 14th Dalai Lama in Dharamshala, India, Guo wrote a letter to Raid stating that the 14th Dalai Lama is a \"political exile disguised as a religious figure who has long engaged in anti-China separatist activities\" and that \"as a responsible politician, a member of the Riigikogu should firmly adhere to international norms, respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" In response to Guo's letter, Raid stated in an interview with Postimees that \"China occupied Tibet\" and that \"Estonian citizens are not employees of his embassy or subjects of the communist dictatorship of China.\" He also stated that \"what China cannot do, however, is demand that we should cease any form of interaction with the so-called Tibetan government in exile.\"\nPersonal life\nShe is married and has two sons.

    "Buddhist temple in Tokyo, Japan\nSainen-ji (\u897f\u5ff5\u5bfa) is a Buddhist temple belonging to the J\u014ddo-sh\u016b sect, located in Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo, Japan. It is known as the temple founded by Hattori Hanz\u014d, a famous samurai of the Sengoku Period who served Tokugawa Ieyasu. The temple is the family temple of the Hattori clan, and contains the graves of Hanz\u014d and other members of the Hattori clan. In addition, there is a memorial tower that is said to have been built by Hanz\u014d for Tokugawa Ieyasu's eldest son, Nobuyasu, whom Hanz\u014d served as guardian.\nHistory\nSainen-ji Temple was founded in 1594, shortly after the Tokugawa clan took possession of Edo , when Hattori Hanz\u014d founded its predecessor, An'yoin, in Shimizudani, Kojimachi, Edo (near modern-day Shimizudani Park in Kioicho, Chiyoda Ward). Hanz\u014d took the Buddhist name Saien to commemorate the soul of Matsudaira Nobuyasu, who had died an untimely death. He built a memorial tower at An'yoin and spent the rest of his life praying for Nobuyasu's soul. After his death in 1597, he was posthumously given the Buddhist name Senshoinden An'yo Saien Daizenjomon and was buried in the same hermitage.\nLater, due to the expansion of Edo Castle in the surrounding area, An'yo-in was moved to its current location in around 1634 and newly built as a temple. The current mountain name and temple name of Sainen-ji are derived from his posthumous name.\nHistoric sites and cultural properties\nTokugawa (Matsudaira) Nobuyasu Memorial Tower: Shinjuku Ward designated historic site. Located behind the current main hall on the right side, it is a large Gorinto (stone tower) in a stone fence with a stone door bearing the three-leaf hollyhock crest, and has an inscription on the front that reads \"Sanshu Tatsuiwa Zentsu Daikoshi in front of Seiryu-ji Temple.\" There is an explanatory board for the \"Okazaki Saburo Nobuyasu Memorial Tower\" installed by the Shinjuku Ward Board of Education.\nThe Grave of Hattori Hanz\u014d: A designated historic site by Shinjuku Ward. A large stone pagoda to the immediate left of the entrance to the temple cemetery is engraved with the words \"Anyo Saien Daizenjomon\" and \"14th day of the 1st year of the Heishin era (1606).\" There is also an explanatory board for \"Hattori Hanzo's Grave\" set up by the Shinjuku Ward Board of Education.\nHattori Hanzo's spear: Registered tangible cultural property of Shinjuku Ward. The temple has a spear that is said to have been bestowed by Ieyasu at Hamamatsu Castle to Hattori Hanz\u014d, nicknamed \"Spear Hanz\u014d\" due to his proficiency with spears, as a temple treasure. The spear was once about one and a half ken (about 2.6 meters), but is now chipped and shorter.\nGallery\nThe grave of Hattori Hanz\u014d\nThe Gorint\u014d of Matsudaira Nobuyasu\nReferences\n^ Kawahara, Yoshitsugu (3).

    "Argentine-bred thoroughbred racehorse\nNigromante (11 October 1944\u201327 April 1962) was an Argentine-bred thoroughbred racehorse and notable sire. He won two legs of the Argentine Triple Crown and was among the leading sires in both Argentina and the United States.\nBackground\nNigromante was a dark chestnut horse bred by Ernesto Pueyrred\u00f3n's Haras Chapadmalal. He was very muscular, with strong hindquarters and a high head, and he had three white socks.\nNigromante was a full brother to Ni\u00f1a Bruja, the first foal of his dam, Nigu\u00e1. Ni\u00f1a Bruja was a successful racer and was considered the best three-year-old filly in Argentina in 1946.\nRacing career\nNigromante only raced in the year of 1947, and was successful enough to be considered one of the best of his generation. He won 6 of his 8 starts, including the Gran Premio Polla de Potrillos, Gran Premio Jockey Club, and Gran Premio Montevideo. In both of his two losses, the Gran Premio Nacional and the Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini, he finished second to Doubtless.\nNigromante won the first leg of the Argentine Triple Crown, the Polla de Potrillos, by 3 lengths in a time of 1:361\u20445 for 1600 meters. He only faced three other horses in the race, having scared away other potential competition.\nNigromante won his sixth race, the Gran Premio Jockey Club, the second leg of the Argentine Triple Crown. He faced five opponents, and ran in a stalking position behind the fast pace-setter Doubtless. Despite going wide around the turn and being interfered with in the stretch, Nigromante won the race easily by 21\u20442 lengths over Doubtless in a time of 2:014\u20445 for the 2000 meters.\nin the Gran Premio Nacional, which was described as being attended by one of its largest crowds in recent years, Doubtless again took the lead, but set a more reasonable pace than in the Gran Premio Jockey Club. Nigromante entered the stretch 6 lengths behind the leader, and managed to close to within 11\u20442 lengths of Doubtless at the wire, finishing second in his first defeat.\nStud career\nAfter retiring from racing, Nigromante entered stud at Haras El Bagual. In late 1957, Rex Ellsworth purchased Nigromante and had him imported in the United States to stand at his Ellsworth Ranch in California.\nNigromante was the Champion Sire in Argentina in 1957, and he finished second in 1958 and third in 1961 on the general sire list. In the United States, he finished third on the general list in 1963.\nTo the end of 1969, Nigromante sired the winners of 439 races in Argentina and the United States. The Jockey Club credits Nigromantes with siring 171 foals, including 30 stakes winners (17.5%), although the records of his Argentine offspring may be incomplete.\nNigromante died of a ruptured aorta in April 1962.\nNotable progeny\nCandy Spots, winner of the Preakness Stakes, Arlington-Washington Futurity, Santa Anita Derby, Florida Derby, American Derby, Jersey Derby, etc. Notable sire.\nSolito, winner of the Gran Premio Polla de Potrillos and Gran Premio San Isidro\nAnsiedad, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n\nMarista, winner of the Gran Premio Jockey Club\nBlack Sheep, winner of the American Derby\nBagualero, winner of the Cl\u00e1sico Santiago Luro\nJezabel, winner of the Cl\u00e1sico Jorge Atucha\nNiquel, Champion Sire in Peru\nVenusto, winner of the Cl\u00e1sico Comparaci\u00f3n\nMagosto, winner of the Cl\u00e1sico La Mission\n\nNotable progeny of daughters\nHuxley, winner of the Gran Premio Jockey Club\nFlying Target, winner of the Arlington Handicap\n\nPedigree\nReferences\n^ a b c Mayorga, Jorge (1963).

    "Military installation in Wandsworth, London, England\nWandsworth Barracks is a military installation on Merton Road, Southfields, London, England. It currently accommodated the regional headquarters of the Royal Marines Reserve.\nHistory\nPrior to the dissolution of the monasteries, the site on the east side of Merton Road was occupied by Dunsford Manor which was owned by Merton Priory. The manor was transferred to the ownership of Sir Alan Broderick in the 17th century, and remained in the hands of the Broderick family until the estate was sold in 1851. The site was then acquired by the War Office and was used to accommodate the local Army Forms Depot. The depot was one of a series around the UK responsible for issuing stationery for military use.\nIn the 1930s, a drill hall was erected on the site. It was a square-shaped brick building with its entrance on the north side. The first occupant was the 27th (London Electrical Engineers) Anti-Aircraft Battalion Royal Engineers. This regiment was transferred to the Royal Artillery as 27 (London Electrical Engineers) Searchlight Regiment Royal Artillery in August 1940. It was deployed to the middle east during the Second World War but was placed in suspended animation at the end of the war. In 1947, the unit was re-formed as 562 (London Electrical Engineers) (Mixed) Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment RA (TA).\nFollowing re-organisation of the Territorial Army in 1967, the drill hall became the home of 83 Squadron, 31st (City of London) Signal Regiment. In 1994, the barracks also became home to the regimental headquarters of 31st (City of London) Signal Regiment. In 2010, the regiment was disbanded following the concurrent disbandment of the 2nd Signal Brigade and the re-organisation of the TA signals as a result of the Army 2020 reform.\nIn June 2011, the regional headquarters of the Royal Marines Reserve relocated from the drill hall in Old Jamaica Road in Bermondsey to Wandsworth Barracks. The ceremony was attended by the Lord-Lieutenant of Greater London, Sir David Brewer, and the Commandant General Royal Marines, Major General Buster Howes. A series of murals painted by pupils from Southfields Academy depicting historic events involving the Royal Marines was unveiled by the local member of parliament, Justine Greening, on the staircase inside the building in June 2016.\nReferences\n^ Kershaw, S.

    "\nEmir L\u00fcmanovich L\u00fcmanov (Crimean Tatar: Emir L\u00fcman o\u011flu L\u00fcmanov, Russian: \u042d\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041b\u044e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041b\u044e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432; 1911 \u2013 5 September 1941) was an officer in the Red Army during World War II. After he was killed in battle against numerically superior German forces he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union, making him the first Crimean Tatar nominated for the title, but he was only awarded the Order of Lenin.\nBiography\nHis award sheet nominating him for the title Hero of the Soviet Union\nL\u00fcmanov was born in 1911 to a Crimean Tatar family in Aqta\u00e7\u0131 (later renamed Furmanovka), and was the oldest child in his family. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1932 before joining the Red Army in either 1930 or 1933. At the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was a battalion commander in the 586th Rifle Regiment, commanded by Hero of the Soviet Union Ivan Nekrasov of the 5th Guards Rifle Division.\nSince he spoke German, he went on a mission on 20 July 1941 where he dressed up in a Nazi military uniform pretending to be a Nazi commanding officer checking on a unit, only to then take the company has prisoners of war and thereby stop the enemy's advance.\nThe battles for Yelnya in August 1941 were extremely intense: on 11 August, he received orders to lead his battalion in advancing further into Yelnya to expel Nazi forces from the western slopes in the area. In one day of the battle, his battalion killed 200 Nazis. After receiving orders to advance further east, they went on to capture two tanks and four anti-tank guns from the Nazis. By 31 August, his battalion was running very low on ammunition and ran out of food, yet he continued to lead them in battle, at which point they were fighting off numerically superior forces. In four days they managed to break out of the encirclement, but L\u00fcmanov died in the heat of battle on 5 September 1941. He was posthumously nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 3 March 1942, but was awarded just the Order of Lenin instead. His feats and the feats of his battalion were covered by many Soviet newspapers including Pravda, Izvestiya, and Krasnaya Zvezda.\nFootnotes\n^ Most sources report that he entered the Red Army in 1930, but his award nomination for the title Hero of the Soviet Union indicated that he entered the military in 1933.\nReferences\n^ Kurtseitov 215, p.\u00a0109. sfn error: no target: CITEREFKurtseitov215 (help)\n^ Veliyev 2007, p.\u00a014.\n^ a b c Veliyev 2017, p.\u00a0311.\n^ Award list on the site \u00abpamyat-naroda.ru\u00bb (archive materials of TsAMO, \u0444. 33, \u043e\u043f. 682524, \u0434. 310)\n^ Nedolsina & Khamidullin 2015, p.\u00a0211. sfn error: no target: CITEREFNedolsinaKhamidullin2015 (help)\n^ a b Voennyy 2012.\n^ Belyavsky 1941, p.\u00a02.\n^ a b Veliyev 2017, p.\u00a0312.\n^ Lubyagov 2005, p.\u00a0436.\n^ Kurtseitov 2018, p.\u00a0182.\nBibliography\nBelyavsky, Pyotr (28 August 1941). \"\u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\"  (PDF).

It was launched in 1963 and commissioned into the Southern Fleet in 1964, Bayandor was transferred to Iran by the United States under the Mutual Assistance Program.\nConstruction and commissioning\nBayandor was built by the American shipyard Levingston Shipbuilding Company at Orange, Texas. She was laid down on 20 August 1962 and launched on 7 July 1963 on Sabine River, being completed on 15 May 1964. Her commissioning took place three days later on 18 May 1964.\nNaghdi (Persian: \u0646\u0642\u062f\u06cc) was also launched in 1963 and commissioned into the Southern Fleet in 1964, Naghdi was transferred to Iran by the United States under the Mutual Assistance Program.\nService history\nDar es SalaamMuscatColomboMumbaiCochinJakartaGuamSingaporeNew Yorkclass=notpageimage| Known port calls made by Bayandor during her service\nIn September 1964, Bayandor docked at Brooklyn Navy Yard for a three-day visit to New York City.\nOn 12 January 1968, Bayandor was dispatched to Greater Tunb, in response to British-encouraged flying of the Ras Al Khaimah flag at the island. While she was anchored about one mile east of the Tunbs, a Shackleton of the Royal Air Force spotted her. The British aircraft approached close to Bayandor, and subsequently was aimed by the ships' guns. Following the event, the British mission at Trucial States became prepared to deploy the Trucial Oman Scouts, however Bayandor was not in the area by 13 January.\nBayandor\nBayandor and her sister ship Naghdi\u00a0(82) arrived at The Ship Repair Facility in Guam on 10 April 1970 for an overhaul that took six months and costed Iran $1\u20131.5m. In the way home, the two made port calls to Subie Bay, Singapore, Colombo, Sri Lanka and Cochin, India. An alleged dump of 50,000 gallons of fuel in the sea by the ships prior to the repair stirred a local controversy. The two undergone another major repair in the same base in 1978.\nDuring Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u20131988), her home port was in Bushehr Naval Base along with her three other ships.\nOn 13 October 1996, American cruiser USS\u00a0Gettysburg\u00a0(CG-64) bumped into Bayandor in north of Persian Gulf, however neither of the ships suffered from a serious damage.\nIn the 11th deployment of Iran since 2009, Bayandor left home on 29 December 2010 for the Gulf of Aden, returning on 29 January 2011 after 31 days.\nStarting in 2011, she undergone a major refit that was completed on 11 June 2013, during which a new 76mm Fajr-27 gun and Noor AShM launchers were installed. She was also fitted with a new fire control system, while its engines, heat exchangers, and fuel and oil systems had been overhauled. According to Anthony H. Cordesman, \"weapons control, search/track radars, and sonars have not been fully modernized since the mid-1960s, although some aspects of the electronic warfare capabilities, communications, and battle management systems in the Bayandor seem to have been upgraded\".\nAfter the refit and trials, she was teamed up with the replenishment ship Bandar Abbas\u00a0(421) as the 31st naval group, for an anti-piracy operation also as far afield as Bab-el-Mandeb. The deployment took 120 days, lasting from 16 July to 13 November 2014. The two ships saved six merchant vessels from Somali pirates, including a Chinese container ship on 14 September 2014.\nOn 20 January 2016, the 38th naval group comprising Bayandor, the replenishment ship Bushehr\u00a0(422) and the landing ship Lavan\u00a0(514), left home for a multi-purpose anti-piracy, flag, intelligence collection and training mission that included crossing the Bab-el-Mandeb for a voyage to the Red Sea, as well as crossing equator for a port call to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on 1 March 2016. The ships navigated 7,600\u00a0nmi (14,100\u00a0km) in total and returned on 2 April 2016 after 73 days of sailing.\nAlong with her sister Naghdi and the amphibious ship Tonb\u00a0(513) of the 50th naval group, she decked at Colombo, Sri Lanka and Mumbai, India during another multi-purpose anti-piracy, flag and training mission. The deployment started on 30 January 2018 and ended on 17 March 2018.\nAs part of the 60th naval group with Lavan and Bushehr, between 20 January and 16 March 2019 she sailed 5,600\u00a0nmi (10,400\u00a0km) in the Arabian Sea for anti-piracy operations and then made another visit to Colombo. The three vessels also anchored at Muscat, Oman during the mission. In late February 2019, she participated in Velayat 97 wargame as an intelligence collector vessel. Bayandor made security patrols in the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden and between May and July 2019, navigating some 2,350\u00a0nmi (4,350\u00a0km) in the same formation of vessels, this time as the 62nd group.\nSupported by the fleet replenishment oiler Kharg\u00a0(431), she departed home on 30 January 2020 in a voyage to cross the Strait of Malacca. The two ships of the 66th naval group anchored at Port of Tanjung Priok between 25 and 28 Fe",
    "New Zealand cartographer\n\"L. P. Lee\" redirects here. For the bioengineer, see Luke Pyungse Lee.\nLaurence Patrick \"Laurie\" Lee (1913 \u2013 28 January 1985) was a New Zealand mathematician, cartographer, and geodesist who was the Chief Computer for the Department of Lands and Survey and one of the foremost experts on (especially conformal) map projections.\nLife and career\nLee was born in England in 1913, but moved with his family to Auckland at a young age. After earning a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Auckland, he took a job in 1934 in the Department of Public Works in Whang\u0101rei, then transferred in 1936 to the Department of Lands and Survey in Aukland as a draughting cadet. Because of his mathematical talents, in 1941 he was sent to Wellington as a computer, where he remained until his retirement in 1974, serving as the Chief Computer for the department from 1964 to 1974. After retirement he continued consulting for the department.\nLee had a stammer since childhood. In 1950, after reading about research psychologist William Kerr of Jersey, who claimed to have discovered a cure, Lee took a leave of absence from the Department of Lands and Survey and worked as an engineer's steward in return for passage to England on the Trojan Star. After just 18 minutes of Kerr's instruction, Lee could state the date and time without stammering, and after staying with Kerr for two weeks he considered himself effectively cured, with only a slight occasional stammer remaining.\nLee was a lifelong bachelor.\nWork\nThe Lee conformal world in a tetrahedron can be computed using Dixon elliptic functions.\nAt the Department of Lands and Survey, Lee was involved with completing the First Order Geodetic Triangulation of New Zealand, and establishing the Geodetic Datum 1949; the change to metric units; and computations for the latitude and longitude program of the International Geophysical Year, 1957\u20131959.\nLee was a specialist in map projections \u2013 especially conformal projections, which preserve angles and local shapes \u2013 and wrote many papers on the subject. Notably, he developed improved methods for calculating the transverse Mercator projection, developed a conformal projection of the Pacific Ocean minimising scale errors, and computed new conformal polyhedral map projections using elliptic functions. His 1976 monograph Conformal Projections Based on Elliptic Functions is still a definitive survey. His 1944 proposal for classifying map projections has been widely adopted and built upon.\nLee joined New Zealand's Royal Astronomical Society in 1948 and was Director of the Society's Computing Section from 1954 to 1972. From 1974 to 1977 he was an editor for the Society's quarterly journal, Southern Stars. He was a founding member of the New Zealand Institute of Draughtsmen and edited its journal from 1947 to 1950, a founding member of the New Zealand Cartographic Society, and was made an honorary member of the New Zealand Institute of Surveyors in 1971.\nBibliography\nPapers\nLee, L.

    "Species of beetle (firefly)\nPhoturis hebes, commonly known as heebie-jeebies or the slow-hitch firefly, is a species of beetle in the Lampyridae family. It is found in the eastern United States.\nDescription\nP. hebes is a medium-sized firefly, with adults measuring 10\u201312\u00a0mm (0.4\u20130.5\u00a0in) long. It is smaller and narrower than some other Photuris species, such as Photuris lucicrescens. P. hebes have wing covers, or elytra, varying in color from brown to nearly black with light-colored side margins. There is some regional variation in coloring, and depending on the region, they may or may not have shoulder stripes. Coloring on the head shield, or pronotum, also varies. Often the pronotum is yellow, with a dark mark in the center bounded by red or orange. Photuris fireflies have longer legs than species in the other common firefly genus in the United States, Photinus. P. hebes has a pale chest and pale abdominal segments.\nLife Cycle\nBeetles such as P. hebes go through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Photuris fireflies spend the majority of their lives as larvae, which are bioluminescent. Larvae are predaceous, eating snails, worms, and other soft-bodied invertebrates. Adults appear in mid-summer, from June to July.\nBehavior\nOn summer nights starting about 20 minutes after sunset, adult male P. hebes search for a mate by signaling with quick single flashes repeated about every second, depending on temperature. They flash faster when it is warmer and slower when it is colder. Females respond to the males from the grass and possibly from trees.\nHabitat\nP. hebes are seen near trees and fencerows that border fields, pastures, streams, and other open areas.\nRange\nThey are found in the eastern United States, as far west as Oklahoma and south to Georgia.\nReferences\n^ a b c Walker, A.

    "First Lady of Minnesota since 2019 (b.1966)\nGwen Walz (n\u00e9e\u00a0Whipple; born June 15, 1966) is an American educator and public school administrator. She is the 39th and current First Lady of Minnesota as the wife of Governor Tim Walz. In 2024, her husband was announced as the Democratic vice presidential candidate for the 2024 United States presidential election.\nPrior to her husband's election as Governor of Minnesota, Walz worked for over two decades in the public school system as an English teacher. Her first teaching job was in Alliance, Nebraska, where she met her future husband and fellow educator, Tim Walz. In 1996, she and Walz moved to her native Minnesota where they both taught in the Mankato public schools. Retiring and moving to Saint Paul when her husband became governor in 2019, she is the only first lady in Minnesota's history to have an office in the Minnesota State Capitol. Walz oversees a policy portfolio focusing on education, corrections, and gun control legislation.\nEarly life and education\nGwen Whipple was born in 1966 in Glencoe, Minnesota and was raised in Ivanhoe, Minnesota.

    "Far-right political groups use mainstream social media platforms for communication, propaganda, and mobilization. These platforms include Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube. By leveraging viral trends, entertaining content, and direct interaction, far-right groups aim to spread their political messages, recruit followers, and foster a sense of community. Such activities are part of broader political processes and activities that involve the organization and spread of political values and ideologies.\nThe internet has facilitated new channels of communication that significantly impact the spread of news and the dynamics of political discourse. The interactive nature of social media allows far-right groups to reach wider and younger audiences, often using subtle messaging and popular social media tactics. Social media has become a crucial medium for how news and political information are consumed and shared, influencing public perception and civic engagement.\nFar-right groups on platforms like TikTok engage with the youth through relatable and often non-political content to subtly promote their ideologies. This approach can affect political participation and election outcomes by shaping opinions and encouraging political involvement. Additionally, social media usage in political campaigns has become increasingly significant due to its communal and interactive nature, as users engage in discussions, share endorsements, and participate in collective actions such as voting encouragement.\nBackground\nSee also: Social media use in politics and Social media as a news source\nSocial media platforms are known for enabling anyone with an internet connection to create content and actively participate in political discourse. They enhance access to political information. However, many users primarily consume content passively, with content creation concentrated among a small group of active users. According to a Eurobarometer survey by the European Parliament, 79% of young Europeans aged 15 to 24 follow influencers or content creators on social media, highlighting the increasing use of these platforms for news consumption in this age group.\nUse of traditional social media\nFar-right influencers use strategies from influencer culture to spread reactionary messages and monetize their politics. They engage in viral stunts and create real-world commotion to gain online visibility, fostering a sense of shared intimacy with their followers. Additionally, they employ provocative tactics such as trolling and humor to build community and disguise hate speech, while also appearing authentic and relatable to maintain audience support. Far-right groups exploit technological affordances of social media platforms to maximize the reach and impact of their messages. They rely on replicability to share and alter content across different platforms, often decontextualizing messages to fit their narrative. Scalability is achieved through strategic use of algorithms and hashtags, allowing for broader audience engagement and visibility. Additionally, connectivity is enhanced by forming online communities that foster in-group solidarity and facilitate the spread of extremist ideologies, bypassing traditional media gatekeepers and leveraging direct communication with followers.\nFacebook\nFar-right groups have been exploiting Facebook's algorithmic tendencies to create ideological echo chambers, where conservatives and liberals largely consume different political news, leading to increased political polarization - although research is not totally clear on this point yet. Research has shown that changes to Facebook's algorithm significantly alter what users see and how they interact on the platform, with conservatives engaging more with political news and consuming more content flagged as untrustworthy or inaccurate. This asymmetry facilitates the spread of far-right misinformation, as politically aligned content is prioritized, encouraging conservative users to like, share, and comment more frequently on such posts. In addition to algorithmic manipulation, far-right militias and extremist groups have established strong presences on Facebook, using the platform to organize, recruit, and spread their ideology. They create private groups and pages that foster a sense of community and solidarity among members, often bypassing platform moderation policies. These groups frequently engage in activities designed to provoke conflict and gain visibility, such as trolling and viral stunts, and use Facebook's connectivity features to coordinate real-world actions and protests. Despite Meta's efforts to moderate content, far-right groups continue to leverage Facebook's features to maintain and grow their influence online.\nInstagram\nFar-right groups have adeptly utilized Instagram to recruit young followers and spread extremist ideologies. Instagram's visual nature and algorithmic design makes it subsceptible to these activities. Far-rig",
    "American college football season\nThe 1961 Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs football team was an American football team that represented the University of Minnesota Duluth as a member of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) during the 1961 college football season. In their fourth year under head coach Jim Malosky, the Bulldogs compiled an 8\u20131 record (7\u20130 in conference games), won the MIAC championship, and outscored opponents by a total of 356 to 112.\nThe team scored 70 points against Gustavus Adolphus, breaking the Duluth single-game scoring record of 61 points set one year earlier against St Thomas. One week later, Minnesota-Duluth added 61 points against Hamline. Over the course of nine games, the team averaged 39.4 points per game, the second highest average in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) behind Florida A&M.\nOver the course of nine games, the Bulldogs tallied 3,268 yards of total offense (363 yards per game), consisting of 2,247 rushing yards and 1,021 passing yards. On defense they gave up 1,585 yards of total offense (176 yards per game).\nHalfback John Nachtsheim ranked third in the NAIA with 112 points scored on 17 touchdowns and five two-point conversions. The team's leading rushers were Nachtsheim (689 yards on 129 carries) and Bruce Johnson (674 yards on 110 carries). Quarterback Ed Lundstrom led the team in both passing yards (870) and total offense (1,107 yards).\nMinnesota-Duluth players took five first-team spots on the 1961 NAIA All-District 13 football team: John Nachtsheim are left halfback (offense); Ed Lundstrom at quarterback (offense); Tom Adams at left end (offense); Ron Kosteliz at left tackle (offense and defense).\nSchedule\n\nReferences\n^ \"Linfield Third As Whittier Fourth; Pittsburgh Top Team\".

    "\nThe Siege of Agadir in 1533 was a military confrontation started by the troops of Mohammed al-Shaykh against the Portuguese fortress of Santa Cruz do Cabo da Gu\u00e9. The Portuguese resisted the siege.\nHistory\nThe Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gu\u00e9 fortress was built in 1505 by Jo\u00e3o Lopes de Sequeira but sold to Manuel I of Portugal in 1512.\nMohammed al-Shaykh had begun to dominate the lords and tribes of southern Morocco, so the Portuguese in Agadir saw any supplies from the interior cut off and reduced to the fortress grounds. The Muslim leader intended to conquer Agadir to obtain a port that would allow him to export the sugar produced in Suz and understood the prestige he had to gain from the expulsion of Christians from that place. Many foreign merchants, French, Castilian and Genoese, smuggled weapons to him.\nSince 1531, the fortress of Santa Cruz had been under pressure from the surrounding tribes and a siege was anticipated. Mohammed al-Shaykh fortified himself in two villages near Santa Cruz, where a large number of warriors had gathered since the beginning of 1533. Portuguese spies informed the garrison of the enemy's movements and, in the fortress, the Portuguese were already spending the nights in prevention and with close watch, followed by nightly peals from the bell tower.\nOn a certain day at the end of April or beginning of May, the fortress walls were scaled by surprise, the captain was murdered in his quarters and the Keep was invaded. The garrison and residents rushed to the castle, the tower door was opened with an axe and the Muslims were expelled, many throwing themselves from the top of the tower onto the beach. Once the tower was recovered, the Portuguese began to fire artillery, which was joined by rifle fire and the large crowd of Muslims that had gathered around the fortress was dispersed.\nWhen they were already celebrating their victory, a man approached the gunpowder barrels and was able to destroy a wall in the fortress.\nFortunately for the Portuguese, the walls fell inwards without clogging the pit, and the Keep did not collapse. The fortress wall was open almost to the ground, but the great smoke that the explosion caused was carried by the wind towards the Muslims, which confused them about what had happened, and two hours later when the smoke disappeared, the Portuguese survivors had filled part of the hole with many items found inside the fortress.\nWhen the Muslims returned, they killed many Christians, but these, protected by mattresses, continued to work, even during the night. They built a wall with different materials almost as high as it was before. And before dawn, two men changed the texture of the wall on the outside, making it look like it was made of stone, just as it looked the day before. Thus they deceived the Muslim invaders, who attributed the feat to witchcraft. Only 40 men were able to fight on the Portuguese side.\nMohammed al-Shaykh retreated with his men three days later.\nThe fortress of Santa Cruz would be besieged again by Mohammed al-Shaykh in 1541 and lost on that occasion.\nSee also\nPortuguese Empire\nSiege of Mazagan (1562)\nPortuguese Asilah\nPortuguese Tangier\nPortuguese conquest of Ceuta\nBattle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir\nFall of Agadir\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g Figanier, Joaquim (1945).

    "2024 neologism of four nations with increased anti-West cooperation\n\u00a0\u00a0Axis of Upheaval (Russia, China, Iran, North Korea)\nThe Axis of Upheaval, the \"deadly quartet\", or \"CRINK\", is a term coined in 2024 by Center for a New American Security foreign policy analysts Richard Fontaine and Andrea Kendall-Taylor and used by many foreign policy analysts, military officials, and international groups to describe the growing Anti-Western collaboration between Russia, Iran, China, and North Korea beginning in the early 2020s. \nThe loose alliance generally represented itself in diplomatic addresses and public statements as an \"anti-hegemony\" and \"anti-imperialist\" coalition with intentions to challenge what it deemed to be a Western-dominated global order to reshape international relations into a multipolar order according to their shared interests. While not a formal bloc, these nations have increasingly coordinated their economic, military, and diplomatic efforts, making strong efforts to aid each other to undermine Western influence.\nTerm\nThe \"Axis of Upheaval\" as a term was coined in the April 2024 article \"The Axis of Upheaval\" written by foreign policy analysts Richard Fontaine and Andrea Kendall-Taylor for the Foreign Affairs magazine, as part of the Center for a New American Security United States-based national security think tank. Fontaine picked the phrase due to it representing the group of nations' shared disdain for and desire to uproot Western influence and values without using language that was \"too overbearing\", such as with the \"Axis of Evil\" or \"axis of autocracy\".\nNATO policy planning head Benedetta Berti expressed that she preferred to use the phrase \"strategic convergence\" instead of \"axis\" when describing the coalition of nations.\nBackground\nSee also: Russian invasion of Ukraine, Cross-strait relations, and Axis of Resistance\nThe roots of cooperation among nations in the axis stretch back decades during the onset of the Cold War, based on the divide between the First World and Second World. The Soviet Union represented the lead superpower of the latter, providing assistance to and sharing communist, anti-Western philosophies with the People's Republic of China and North Korea.\nWhile these nations have generally remained on neutral or good terms since the break-up of the Soviet Union, their alliance intensified significantly following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Foreign policy analyst Andrea Kendall-Taylor stated that it seemed that Russian President Vladimir Putin misjudged the level of \"extraordinary\" Western coordination between the United States, Europe, and other West-friendly countries on economic sanctions and military aid to Ukraine. However, she expressed that the West's hardline and absolute response inadvertently served as a catalyst for Russia to accelerate pushing for closer economic and diplomatic ties with nations at odd with Western nations, due to it seemingly marking a \"point of no return\" for Russian\u2013Western relations that increased Putin's determination to move past them.\nCharacteristics\nWhile the Axis of Upheaval is not a formal union or alliance, it is generally united by a shared opposition to what it calls U.S. hegemony and the Western-led international order. The axis's countries have dramatically increased their economic and military cooperation while coordinating their diplomatic, information, and security efforts, operating as a loose coalition of like-minded states in resistance to economic or ideological pressure from Western nations.\nAnti-Western sentiment\nSee also: Polarity (international relations)\nThe motivations driving the loose alliance are multi-faceted, but are primarily centered on a desire for greater regional influence and control away from Western powers' \"imperialism\". The axis members reject Western-defined universal values and the \"championing of its brand of democracy as an attempt to undermine their legitimacy and foment domestic instability\". They view U.S. presence in their regions of influence as a threat to their interests and sovereignty, stating that they should hold the right to instate democracy based on their own institutions and culture instead of being forcibly shaped by Western principles. Collectively, they represent themselves as anti-imperialists sharing the goal of creating a multipolar world order that diminishes U.S. global dominance, which includes resisting \"external meddling in their internal affairs, the expansion of U.S. alliances, the stationing of American nuclear weapons abroad, and the use of coercive sanctions\".\nEconomic cooperation\nEconomic ties among the axis members have strengthened considerably since 2022. Following an early 2022 signing of a joint agreement between President of China Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin establishing a \"'no-limits' partnership\", China has become Russia's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching record levels in 2023 and 2024. In 2023, trade between Russia and China excee",
    "New Zealand research vessel\nRV Kaharoa II is a research vessel operated by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) of New Zealand. The contract for her construction was awarded to Astilleros Armon Vigo in Spain in 2022 as a replacement for the RV Kaharoa, put into service in 1981. She was launched in 2023 and entered service in 2024.\nConstruction\nPlanning for the RV Kaharoa II took 6 years. It was scheduled for construction in March 2022 to replace the aging RV Kaharoa, which was 41 years old at the time. The ship was designed by Norwegian naval architecture firm Skipsteknisk, which also designed the RV Tangaroa. The Norwegian propulsion company Finn\u00f8y was contracted for the development of low-noise propulsion systems on the ship, classified as DNV Silent A-F.\nConstruction began in October 2022 and the keel was laid in January of 2023. The ship was launched on August 30, 2023.\nThe ship passed through the Panama Canal and then stopped in San Diego, California in June 2024 en route to New Zealand. It arrived in New Zealand in August 2024, after 83 days of transit sailing from Spain.\nCharacteristics\nThe Kaharoa II was built with the intention of supporting the next 40 years of fisheries research in New Zealand, as well as taking over a number of scientific responsibilities from its predacessor. It is 8 meters longer than the Kaharoa, with additional deck space to continue the deployment of Argo floats. She cost $35\u00a0million.\nKaharoa II features 12.9 square metres (139\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of dry lab space, 12.6 square metres (136\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of wet lab space, a conference space, and accommodates nine science passengers in five cabins. The aft deck measures 85 square metres (910\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). It features an A-frame and starboard T-frame for science operations, with two 2,000 metres (6,600\u00a0ft) trawl winches, a 6,500 metres (21,300\u00a0ft) CTD winch, and 4,000 metres (13,000\u00a0ft) oceanographic winch.\nAcoustic equipment include a Kongsberg EM712 and EM2040, as well as an EK80 sounder. It uses a Seapath 380-R3 for its attitude reference system and a HiPAP 352 for hydro-acoustic positioning. It has a Topas PS40 sub-bottom profiler.\nHistory\nRV Kaharoa II was christened by Minister of Science, Innovation and Technology Judith Collins on 19 August 2024. Her first voyage will be to take images of the seafloor of the Hauraki Gulf.\nReferences\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Kaharoa II (ship, 2024).\n^ \"See construction of the Kaharoa II\".

    "French resistance leader\nMaurice Duclos (23 August 1906 - 23 February 1981), codename Saint-Jacques, was a French soldier, insurance broker, anti-communist militant activist, intelligence agent and founder of the first French resistance network of WWII, also called Saint-Jacques, and two others.\nBiography\nEarly career\nHe was born in Neuilly sur Seine. He studied at the Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Croix and then entered his father's business. After\nIn 1926, Duclos joined the Colonial artillery and served for two years in Madagascar. In November 1928, he was released from active service with the rank of sergeant and became an insurance broker.\nLa Cagoule\nIn the 1930s, he became an active member of the Organisation secr\u00e8te d'action r\u00e9volutionnaire nationale known as La Cagoule, an extreme-right-wing terror group. Members were called Cagoulards. On 11 September 1937, bombs planted by Cagoulards destroyed the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du patronat fran\u00e7ais and the Union des industries et m\u00e9tiers de la m\u00e9tallurgie in Paris, killing two gendarmes and injuring two other people. The bombings became known as the \u00c9toile attacks because of their proximity to that Paris landmark. Duclos was imprisoned in February 1938 for three-and-a-half months in La Sant\u00e9 Prison for trafficking the explosives for the attacks from the ship Atalante.\nWorld War II\nHe was called up on 22 August 1939. Having been an artillery lieutenant in the army reserve, he was made a lieutenant, fourth battery, second group of the 10e r\u00e9giment d'artillerie coloniale (10th Colonial Artillery Regiment). From May to June 1940, he fought with his unit in the Norwegian campaign. Detached as a liaison officer to the 13e demi-brigade de L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re, he distinguished himself in the fighting around Narvik, was promoted to honorary corporal of the Foreign Legion and received the Norwegian War Cross with sword. His unit returned to Brittany on 15 June 1940 and was encircled but he escaped from Pl\u00e9n\u00e9e-Jugon on 17 June.\nPlaque commemorating the Saint-Jacques resistamce network at the H\u00f4tel Delpech de Chaunot, Paris\nThe BCRA\nOn 21 June, Duclos and some comrades reached England via Jersey on a fishing boat. France capitulated to Nazi Germany the following day under Philippe P\u00e9tain. On 1 July 1940, he joined Charles de Gaulle's Free France in London, under the orders of Andr\u00e9 Dewavrin (codename \"Colonel Passy\"), and was assigned to the intelligence service which became the Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action (BCRA), an organisation initially with military and political roles. It was Duclos who suggested Paris M\u00e9tro names for codenames - his choice was \"Saint-Jacques\".:\u200a241\u200a\nHaving landed on the beach at Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados on 4 August to assess the Nazi military potential for Adolf Hitler's planned invasion of England, he went to Paris, where he created the Saint-Jacques network based at his premises at the Place Vend\u00f4me, before laying the foundations of the Paris Job network and then helping to found the Confr\u00e9rie Notre-Dame network with Gilbert Renault (codename \"R\u00e9my\"). The Saint-Jacques network - part of the BCRA and operational from August 1940 - was the first French intelligence network of the war. On 18 August, he met fellow former Cagoulard, journalist Gabriel Jeantet, who became the propaganda chief of the Vichy r\u00e9gime. Jeantet introduced him to a number of Vichy colleagues in their new roles; despite the fact that Duclos had sided with de Gaulle, Jeantet maintained it was possible to be both anti-German and close to P\u00e9tain. Duclos crossed between the two wartime zones in France making contacts, especially in the fr:Compagnie parisienne de distribution d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 and the railways. Through Perpignan, he entered Spain in November before returning to London on 24 December.:\u200a74\u201376\u200a\nOn the night of 13\u201314 February 1941, he parachuted into the Dordogne from a bomber with his radio operator, John G\u00e9rard Mulleman. Landing in a wooded area, he broke his right leg and sprained the other. Unable to find Mulleman, he made makeshift splints and made it to a farm. The farmer called a doctor and the doctor reported him to the police. The doctor's view was that de Gaulle was surrounded by \"communists and Jews, enriching themselves off the backs of the English.\" Duclos was arrested and taken to the hospital in P\u00e9rigueux. On hearing this, Pierre Foucaud - another fellow former Cagoulard working under de Gaulle - contacted Jeantet in Paris; this \"old boys' network\" resulted in Duclos being dismissed from hospital and custody on 13 March. He managed to reach the demarcation line at Orthez. He crossed into the occupied zone with the help of an intermediary of Renault and continued walking across fields during the night, all the time on crutches. In Paris, by April 1941, the Saint-Jacques network established the first radio link between Paris (from the Place Vend\u00f4me premises) and Free France in London. However, Duclos suspected Mulleman - who was settled in Paris on his a",
    "American painter\nHerman Cherry (1909\u20131992) was a non-objective abstract painter who participated in all five of the artist-curated Stable Gallery exhibitions in Manhattan between 1953 and 1957 and who received his first New York solo exhibition at Stable in 1955. In the early 1930s, he was a student first of the synchromist painter Stanton Macdonald-Wright at the Art Students League of Los Angeles and next of the regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton at the Art Students League of New York. Afterward, Cherry managed a small gallery within a Hollywood bookshop where he gave Philip Guston his first exhibition and where his own first solo was later held. Having transitioned from social realism to cubist-inspired abstraction in the 1940s, Cherry joined with the artists who later became collectively known as the New York School in establishing a style that later became known as Abstract expressionism. Key members of this group were Cherry's friends Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning.\nCherry's mature works were entirely abstract. Known as a masterful colorist, he often received favorable attention from critics and art historians. In 1984, the art historian Helen A. Harrison wrote: \"At a time when many artists seem to be angered by paint itself, using it crudely and with little apparent regard for its inherent beauty, Cherry comes off as something of a romantic. His evident enchantment with the medium is expressed in terms of tonal relationships. His colors become characters that act out roles relative to each other, according to their own scenario\u2014sometimes dramatic, sometimes mysterious, occasionally even humorous\u2014as directed by the master's hand. And that direction is as respectful of each color's individuality as it is sensitive to the results of their confrontations and interactions.\"\nDuring a career that spanned nearly six decades, Cherry's work appeared frequently in solo and group exhibitions within commercial galleries, museums, and the galleries of artists' collectives. Throughout his career, he was active in artists' associations, gave lectures on art, taught art as a visiting professor, wrote articles for art journals, and produced a book of poetry. Born in New Jersey to parents who had emigrated from Eastern Europe, he grew up in Philadelphia and Los Angeles and later spent much of his adult life in Manhattan, Woodstock, and East Hampton, New York.\nEarly life and training\nCherry was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Late in life, he told an interviewer that his parents opposed his childhood interest in art. Nonetheless, when he was twelve, he began taking free art classes at Philadelphia's Graphic Sketch Club. Three years later, then living in Los Angeles, he dropped out of high school and found work as a set designer for the 20th Century Fox film studio. In 1927, a small compensation he received as victim of an automobile accident enabled him to enroll as a night student at the Otis Art Institute. A scholarship and employment as a school monitor enabled him to continue studying for two years. Cherry later credited one of his Otis teachers, the synchromist artist, Stanton MacDonald-Wright, with his understanding of color. He said: \"It wasn\u2019t that he taught me color. He made me see color.\u201d  Leaving Los Angeles, he knocked around California as an itinerant laborer and then became a cook's helper on a cargo ship destined for Northern European ports. Having jumped ship in Poland, he spent part of the year 1930 looking at paintings in German museums and galleries and then found work on another ship bound for Savannah, Georgia. While studying with MacDonald-Wright, Cherry had come across an article about Thomas Hart Benton that intrigued him, and so, after landing in Savannah, he hitchhiked to Manhattan to take classes at the Art Students League where Benton was then teaching. In 1931, Benton took him on as an assistant as he began work on Benton's well-known America Today mural for The New School for Social Research.\nCareer in art\nIn the fall of 1931, Cherry returned to Los Angeles where, for the next few years, he ran a gallery in a disused room at the back of a Hollywood bookshop owned by Stanley Rose. Known first as the Younger Painters' Gallery and later as the Stanley Rose Gallery, it was informally known as the \"back room\", and it also served as an informal avant-garde cultural center. In 1933, Cherry gave Philip Guston the first exhibition of his career in the Stanley Rose Gallery.  When, in 1934, he gave himself his first solo exhibition at the gallery, a critic for the Los Angeles Times said his drawings had \"the beauty of clarity in line and form\" and said a self-portrait (shown in the infobox, above) was \"strong like wood sculpture and fine in color\". Cherry later said that during the three years he ran the gallery he could not recall making a single sale.\nIn 1937, Cherry joined the Federal Art Project.:\u200a101\u200a Reporting to the California director of the p",
    "1926 poem by Australian poet John Shaw Neilson\n\"The Gentle Water Bird\" (1926) is a poem by Australian poet John Shaw Neilson.\nIt was originally published in The Sydney Morning Herald on 10 April 1926, as by \"Shaw Neilson\", and was subsequently reprinted in the author's single-author collections and a number of Australian poetry anthologies.\nThe poem details how the poet sees God in his study of a crane landing on water.\nCritical reception\nIn his biography of Shaw Neilson for The Advocate Bernard O'Brien wrote: \"His family was Scottish and Presbyterian, and his mother had a touch of melancholy which made his early religious training very severe. As a boy he was not allowed even to go out walking on Sunday. But an interesting poem, \"The Gentle Water Bird,\" tells how he arrived at a truer idea of religion and of God. Watching the cranes in the reeds, it suddenly struck him that the God Who created these lovely creatures, and provided them with such a peaceful, contented existence, must Himself be attractive,\nloving and kind. The poem salutes the bird as a messenger from heaven, and his whole life was nourished by that conviction.\"\nPublication history\nAfter the poem's initial publication in The Sydney Morning Herald it was reprinted as follows:\nNew Poems by John Shaw Neilson, Bookfellow (1927)\nCollected Poems of John Shaw Neilson by John Shaw Neilson, Lothian (1934)\nCross-Country\u00a0: A Book of Australian Verse edited by John Barnes and Brian MacFarlane, Heinemann (1984)\nAnthology of Australian Religious Poetry edited by Les Murray, Collins Dove (1986)\nJohn Shaw Neilson\u00a0: Poetry, Autobiography and Correspondence edited by Cliff Hanna, UQP (1991)\nHell and After\u00a0: Four Early English-Language Poets of Australia edited by Les Murray, Carcanet (2005)\nCollected Verse of John Shaw Neilson edited by Margaret Roberts, UWA Publishing (2012)\nSee also\n1926 in Australian literature\n1926 in poetry\nReferences\n^ a b \"Austlit \u2014 \"The Gentle Water Bird\" by John Shaw Neilson\".

    "Historic home in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States\nUnited States historic place\nThe Brigham Young Forest Farmhouse is a historic home in Salt Lake City, Utah. The building was once owned by Brigham Young, an early leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and first governor of Utah Territory. Built between 1861 and 1863, it was located on Young's Forest Farm near the southern boundary of Salt Lake City. Restored from 1969 to 1970, the home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and subsequently relocated to This Is the Place Heritage Park in 1975.\nForest Farm\nBrigham Young's Forest Farm was located approximately 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) southeast of downtown Salt Lake City; today this area is known as Forest Dale. The farm was well known for its agricultural experiments, especially attempts to grow crops new to the area. It was the first location where alfalfa and sugar beets were grown in Salt Lake Valley. The local silk industry (overseen by Zina D. H. Young) was also moved to a cocoonery on the farm, where nearly 30 acres (12\u00a0ha) of mulberry trees were planted to provide food for the silkworms. For many years, the farm's primary produce came from its large dairy.\nFarmhouse\nDwellings on the farm were adobe or log cabins until construction of the farmhouse began in 1861 and was completed in 1863. The home was constructed with a rock foundation and wood frame walls, covered with stucco. It was built using the balloon framing technique, likely the first such structure in Utah. The floor plan is a double cross-wing and its style is Gothic Revival Cottage. Its original cost was $25,000 (equivalent to $618,649 in 2023). The front door opened to the dining room and on either side were the kitchen, social room, and sitting room; the second floor contained the bedrooms.\nSusannah Snively Young, who lived at the farm longer than any other of Young's wives\nBrigham Young did not regularly live in the Forest Farmhouse, and one of his 56 wives (the \"wife in residence\") would supervise the farm. Young's wife Ann Eliza Young later complained that the home was inadequate against the winter cold and summer heat, and that Young only sent disliked wives to Forest Farm, where they were heavily worked. Susannah Snively Young lived at the farm longer than any other of Young's wives; she was particularly skilled with the dairy work. Young would commonly bring guests to stay at the Farmhouse, including actress Julia Dean Hayne.\nAfter Young's death\nYoung died in 1877 and the farmhouse remained in his family until 1889, when it was sold to George Mousley Cannon. Cannon divided up the farm land into building lots, creating what is today Forest Dale. After Young's death and as the new neighborhood grew, the farmhouse was used as a schoolhouse, ward meetinghouse, and community gathering place.\nIn 1923, the home was heavily remodeled, including removing the porches and southern portion of the building, to create a \"modern\" house. What remained of the home was purchased by Frank and Gwen Wilcox in the 1950s, and after learning it had once belonged to Brigham Young, they started to restore what had survived. In 1968, the Wilcoxes donated the equity in the house to the LDS Church, which then owned the building after paying off the remaining mortgage. The Wilcoxes, together with the church (and its curator Florence S. Jacobsen), restored the farmhouse, including rebuilding the demolished portion of the home. On April 2, 1970, Spencer W. Kimball, the LDS Church's Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, dedicated the home as a historic site visitors' center of the church. The restored home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 14, 1971.\nRelocation\nIn 1974, the LDS Church and Utah state government agreed to a property trade, in which the church would give the Forest Farmhouse to the state and in return the state would give the church two historic sites it owned in southern Utah (the Brigham Young Winter Home and Office and Jacob Hamblin House). The church would then operate the two southern Utah homes as historic site visitors' centers and the state would move the Forest Farmhouse to Pioneer Trail State Park (currently This Is the Place Heritage Park) where it would be a feature of Old Deseret Village.\nIn order to move the house from its original location, the building was sawed in half horizontally, where the gables reached the walls. On Monday, May 12, 1975, the top half of the home was lifted off and placed on a large moving carriage. The following day this half was moved to the park, and on Wednesday the bottom half of the home followed. The two pieces were then joined at their new location on Saturday, May 17. During the move, original pieces of stucco were discovered, which appeared to be deep red and scored to look like brick. Because of the move, the walls had to be redone and craftsmen were brought in to complete the work. At the park, the farmhouse",

    "British animal protectionism activist\nClive Thomas Patrick Hollands (26 April 1929 \u2013 16 November 1996) was a British animal protectionism activist and anti-vivisectionist who campaigned to improve animal welfare laws.\nBiography\nHollands was educated at St Mary's College in Liverpool. He served in the Royal Navy from 1946 to 1953. In the 1960s he took interest in animal welfare and realized that since most legislation results from pressure on Government to act, it is important for animal welfare organisations to become unified. Hollands joined the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Vivisection in 1966 as Assistant Secretary under Harvey Metcalfe. He became its secretary in 1970 and director in 1988. In 1976, he founded the Animal Welfare Year as chairman with the support of 67 animal welfare societies. He used Animal Welfare Year to arouse public interest and influence sympathetic MPs to support government action in revising and updating animal welfare legislation. The Animal Welfare Year defined its objective to \"revise and bring up-to-date present legislation, and for the introduction of new legislation\u2013Where the emphasis must be on the protection and wellbeing of animals and not on commercial interest or profit\".\nHollands was an anti-vivisectionist. He supported the abolishment of animal experimentation but felt it was unrealistic to gain governmental support so worked to reform animal welfare laws. He was Secretary of the Committee for the Reform of Animal Experimentation. He was a member of the Farm Animal Welfare Council. He commented that the \"best definition of animal welfare... embraces the concept of dignity: it means: according to animals the natural dignity which is their due as living sentient creatures\".\nHollands was a vice-president of the RSPCA (1980\u20131982) and an advisory director of the World Society for the Protection of Animals. In recognition of his service to animal welfare, Hollands was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1995.\nAnimals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986\nIn 1977, Hollands with Douglas Houghton, Baron Houghton of Sowerby and Richard D. Ryder formed the General Election Co-ordinating Committee for Animal Protection (GECCAP). The GECCAP brought together representatives from the Committee for the Reform of Animal Experimentation, Farm Animal Welfare Co-Ordinating Executive, Humane Education Council, National Joint Equine Welfare Committee and the League Against Cruel Sports.\nGECCAP aimed to \"put animal into politics\" by persuading the main political parties to include animal welfare policies in their election manifestos for the 1979 United Kingdom general election. Their campaign was successful as the Labour Party, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats published some commitments for the first time. All parties included a commitment to legislate a replacement for the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 in their 1979 election manifestos. This led to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986.\nHollands worked under the Committee for the Reform of Animal Experimentation (CRAE) to reform the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876. In 1983, CRAE formed an alliance with the British Veterinary Association (BVA) and FRAME. CRAE was composed of mostly anti-vivisectionists but they campaigned for reform, not abolition of animal experimentation. By 1985 many of their suggestions had been incorporated into the government's proposals for new legislation. The outcome was the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The Act regulates any experimental or scientific procedure which may have the effect of causing a protected animal \"pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm\".\nHe a member of the Animal Procedures Committee that was created by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.\nSelected publications\nCompassion is the Bugler: The Struggle for Animal Rights (1980)\nAnimal Rights in the Political Arena In Peter Singer.

The club has won more than 22 senior football premierships, the first of which was in 1887.\nHistory\nSee also: Australian rules football in the Riverina\nRFNL match between Wagga Tigers and Collingullie at Robertson Oval in 2015\nRobertson Oval Wagga, from the air home of the Tigers\nThe Federal Football Club was formed at the Imperial Hotel in Wagga Wagga in 1861, making it the oldest Australian rules football club outside of Victoria, however little else of the early history of the club. Its first recorded interclub matches did not appear for at least another decade. Federal wore red and white vertical stripes. It appears to have organised scratch intraclub scratch matches and early records appear to indicate that it aligned with the Victorian Rules of football.\nIn response to the rapid growth of the Victorian code the newly formed Sydney based Southern Rugby Football Union (SRFU) in 1874 instituted a ban on its member clubs from playing any matches under those rules. Wagga were left with little other option than to organise local scratch matches as most surrounding clubs had by then begun adopting rugby.\nIts first recorded interclub match was in 1881 against the Albury Football Club in Wagga, just a year before the first rugby matches were held in the region. Despite the SRFU ban, the Victorian code was rapidly growing in popularity and by 1882 there were two more clubs in Wagga. Local competition between clubs commenced in earnest in 1884 around Wagga Wagga which became the Wagga Football Association.\nIn 1949, the Richmond Football Club provided jumpers and the club was renamed the Wagga Tigers. The club has gone on to sustained success with consistent premierships in each decade since.\nPremierships\n1887, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1961, 1962, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1985, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2007, 2016, 2019, 2020\nAFL/VFL players\nThere is a list of players who have played at AFL/VFL:\nRon Birch\nJames Byrne\nJohn Bradley\nBryce Campbell\nPaul Hawke\nPaul Kelly\nKim Kershaw\nBill Lampe\nNeville Miller\nBill Mohr\nJack Mohr\nTed Obudzinski\nJohn Pitura\nBrad Seymour\nIsaac Smith\nMatt Suckling\nReferences\n^ a b \"Club History | Wagga Tigers\". waggatigers.com.au.\n^ Almanac Footy: Bill Mohr \u2013 The Wizard from Wagga Wagga 10 November 2021\n^ a b c A Brief History of Football in Wagga.

    "American judge\nCraig J. Bobay is an American judge who has served in Indiana's state courts in Allen County.  He has served on the Superior Court since 2013, and held various leadership positions on that court. He also played a key part in establishing and developing Indiana's Commercial Courts, both as a leader in studying and planning for these courts creation and operation in numerous Indiana counties, and in serving as a specialist business court judge himself in Allen's Commercial Court. Before going to law school, he worked for Indiana's Superior Court as an administrator, and was a juvenile probation office. After law school, he served as a federal judicial clerk before entering the practice of law.\nJudicial service\nIn 2013, after a merit-based selection and screening process, Indiana Governor Mike Pence appointed Bobay to Allen County's Superior Court's civil division, filling the vacancy left by Judge Daniel G. Heath when he changed divisions to replace retiring Judge Stephen M. Sims. Bobay was subsequently elected and reelected in 2014 and 2020. The Allen Superior Court is a trial court of general jurisdiction with civil, criminal, and family relations divisions.\nBobay was elected by the Allen Superior Courts judges as Chief Judge for the 2016 to 2017 term. He later served as Administrative Judge of the civil division. Among other things as administrative judge, he has been involved with the newly created office of the \"Protection Order Specialist,\" who is to provide technical assistance to those seeking judicial relief and protection from domestic or family abuse, sexual offenses, or stalking.\nFrom 2003 to 2013, Bobay had been a Magistrate in the Allen County Circuit Court, and from 1997 to 2002 he had been a Magistrate in the Allen Superior Court.  The circuit court's jurisdiction is expressly limited to felonies involving driving while intoxicated, traffic violations, nonsupport of children, as well as some civil cases, domestic relations cases, paternity and child support cases, mortgage foreclosures, and it includes problem solving courts such as the Veteran's Court. Magistrates in the Superior and Circuit Courts have certain judicial powers, for example in probate, guardianship, and trust matters and matters concerning children in need of services.\nAs a judge, Bobay has served on the Board of Governors of the Judicial Conference of Indiana. He has served on the Conference's Civil Jury Instructions Committee, Judicial Administration Committee, Problem Solving Courts Committee, Domestic Relations Committee, Jury Rules Committee, and Magistrate Committee.  Bobay chaired the committee that rewrote the Appointed Judicial Officers Deskbook for Indiana Judges and Magistrates. He has served as a member of the Indiana Judges Association Board of Managers, the Allen County Bar Association Board of Directors, and Volunteer Lawyers Program of Northeast Indiana Board of Directors.\nRole in creating Commercial Courts in Indiana\nIn 2013, Indiana's Supreme Court initiated an effort to evaluate the idea of creating specialized commercial courts in the state.  A Business Courts Subcommittee was assigned this task. Bobay was one of the three people on that subcommittee (which also included Marion County Superior Court judge Heather A. Welch). After researching the concept, in 2014, Bobay and Welch formed a broader, informal, Commercial Courts Working Group (the working group) to advise the subcommittee. The working group and subcommittee ultimately urged creating a commercial court pilot project. In 2015, the Indiana Supreme Court formalized the working group. In 2016, Indiana's Supreme Court followed the committee's and working group's recommendations to create a pilot Commercial Court. Bobay was a chair of the working group.\nIn 2016, Bobay was one of the six original pilot Commercial Court judges. The working group tracked and studied the pilot program for three years, and after its reports and recommendations over that time, the Supreme Court made the Commercial Courts permanent in 2019. Bobay was again one of six Indiana judges assigned to the Commercial Court in 2019, and has continued as a Commercial Court judge to the present (as of August 2024). The working group's role ended in 2019, but the Indiana Supreme Court immediately created a Commercial Court Committee as an adjunct to the permanent Commercial Courts. Bobay has served as co-chair, with Welch, on this permanent committee.\nBobay has also served as chair of the Commercial Court Handbook and Treatise Subcommittee of the Commercial Courts Committee, which created a written legal treatise in 2022 as a guide to attorneys practicing in the Commercial Courts, covering areas of Indiana law that arise in the Commercial Courts.\nLegal practice and prior work\nAllen was in private practice for five years as a litigator before joining the judicial branch in 1997.\nBefore going to law school, Allen worked as an administrator in the Superior Court in the 1980s, ",

    "Mozarabic literature (or Mozarab literature) is the literature of the Mozarabs, Christians living under Islamic rule in Spain and their Arabized descendants. They produced literature in both Latin and Arabic.\nLatin\nAmong Latin works, historiography is especially important, since it constitutes the earliest record from al-Andalus of the conquest period. There are two main works from this period, the Chronicle of 741 and the Chronicle of 754. They derived their \"literary style and erudite vocabulary\" primarily from Isidore of Seville.\nIn the mid-ninth century, there was a reaction against Islamization and Arabization within the Mozarab community. One result of this movement was a flourishing of Latin letters within the city of C\u00f3rdoba. Among writers with preserved works are Abbot Speraindeo and his disciples, Paul Albar and Eulogius of C\u00f3rdoba, and, from the end of the century, Abbot Samson of C\u00f3rdoba\u00a0 and Cyprian. Their writings, often letters, are primarily theological, apologetic and hagiographical. Albar wrote fourteen poems and Samson and Cyprian wrote epitaphs in verse. Samson engaged in a theological debate with Bishop Hostegesis\u00a0. In addition, there are nineteen Latin hymns from this period, some of them perhaps written by the aforementioned authors.\nAfter the ninth century, Latin literary production in al-Andalus practically ceases. In the twelfth-century, a Latin\u2013Arabic glossary was compiled to help keep knowledge of Latin alive.\nBesides literary works, Latin is also found on Mozarab tombstones.\nArabic\nReligious\nPages from a Mozarabic Psalter\nMozarabic literature in Arabic began in the latter half of the ninth century, after the C\u00f3rdoban martyrs' movement (850\u2013859). At the height of the martyrs' movement, Albar wrote a treatise in Latin, Indiculus luminosus, defending the martyrs and decrying the movement towards Arabic among his fellow Mozarabs. A generation later, \u1e24af\u1e63 ibn Albar al-Q\u016bt\u012b, finished a rhymed verse translation of the Psalms from the Latin Vulgate in 889. Although it survives in only one manuscript, it was a popular text and is quoted by Muslim and Jewish authors. \u1e24af\u1e63 also wrote a book of Christian answers to Muslim questions about their faith called The Book of the Fifty-Seven Questions. It is lost, but there are excerpts in the work of al-Qur\u1e6dub\u012b, who praises \u1e24af\u1e63' command of Arabic as the best among the Mozarabs. The eleventh-century writer Ibn Gabirol also quotes from a lost work of \u1e24af\u1e63.\nSeveral Arabic translations of the Bible were produced in al-Andalus in addition to \u1e24af\u1e63's verse rendition of the Psalms. No single Arabic version became standard, as the liturgy continued to be in Latin. According to later sources, John of Seville made a translation in the ninth century, but it does not survive. From the tenth century, there is a surviving translations of the Gospels by Is\u1e25\u0101q ibn Bilashku and two prose translations of the Psalms. From the twelfth century, there are translations of the Epistle to the Galatians and the Epistle to the Laodiceans. Some authors quote from still other Arabic translations not otherwise known.\nThere is an Arabic collection of canon law known as the Sistem\u00e1tica moz\u00e1rabe, compiled by a priest named Binjinsiyus for a bishop named al-Usquf \u02bfAbd al-M\u0101lik. It is closely related to the Latin Collectio Hispana systematica\u00a0, but it is not a translation. It contains numerous loanwords from ecclesiastical Latin, but its language is the most Islamicized and Quranic of any Mozarabic work.\nAfter the fall of Toledo in 1085, a Mozarab priest under Christian rule wrote a treatise against Islam, Kit\u0101b tathl\u012bth al-wa\u1e25d\u0101niyya ('The Threefold Nature of the Oneness'), addressed to the Muslims of C\u00f3rdoba. It is lost, but is quoted extensively in a work by al-Qur\u1e6dub\u012b intended to refute it. Another otherwise unknown work by a Mozarab author is cited by al-Khazraj\u012b, but he may have fabricated \"a hypothetical opponent in order to refute\" him.\nOther\nAt least two Christian Arabic works were commissioned by the Caliph al-\u1e24akam II (r.\u2009961\u2013976): the Kit\u0101b al-azm\u0101n, a liturgical calendar and almanac by \u02bfAr\u012bb ibn Sa\u02bf\u012bd al-Qur\u1e6d\u016bb\u012b, and the Kit\u0101b Hur\u016bshiy\u016bsh, a translation of Orosius' History Against the Pagans. The works commissioned by the caliph are of the highest quality among Mozarabic productions. A history of the Franks by Bishop Gotmar III\u00a0 of Girona was presented to al-\u1e24akam probably in 940. It is not extant and is known only through a citation by al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b, who saw a copy in Egypt in 947\u2013948. Another work of Mozarabic historiography, the so-called Mozarabic Universal History, is known from a single manuscript from about 1300. Its beginning is lost and it ends with the Arab conquest. It contains Latin glosses in the margins.\nVery little Mozarabic poetry survives. A few lines of the poet Ibn al-Mir\u02bfizz\u012b al-Na\u1e63r\u0101n\u012b, who was active in the court of al-Mu\u02bftamid of Seville (r.\u20091069\u20131091), are quoted by Ibn Sa\u02bf\u012bd and al-Maqqar\u012b.\nSeveral Mozarabic translations into Arabic are known but ",
    "French resistance network\nThe Saint-Jacques network (French: R\u00e9seau Saint-Jacques) was the first French resistance network of World War II. It was founded by Maurice Duclos - whose codename was Saint-Jacques - and operated under the auspices of Charles de Gaulle's Free France in London.\nHistory\nD\u00e9but with Free France\nFollowing his experience in the Norwegian campaign of 1940, Duclos' unit returned to Brittany but was surrounded by Nazi forces at Pl\u00e9n\u00e9e-Jugon on 17 June. With some colleagues he escaped via Jersey on a fishing boat, reaching England on 21 June, just as France signed the armistice with the Nazis. On 1 July, he joined de Gaulle's Free French in London as a deputy to Andr\u00e9 Dewavrin. Duclos suggested Paris station names as codenames; he chose Saint Jacques for himself, Dewavrin became colonel Passy, Gilbert Renault became R\u00e9my, Pierre Fourcaud (Dewavrin's other deputy) became Barb\u00e8s and Duclos' friend Alexandre Beresnikoff became Corvisart, amongst others.\nImplementation of the network\nDuclos and Beresnikoff landed off a dinghy released from a Royal Navy launch at Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados, on the evening of 4 August, with plans to assess the possibility of Adolf Hitler invading England. They sank their dinghy and went along the coast carrying a basket of carrier pigeons, securing themselves in a crevice under a Nazi guard post. They entered Saint-Aubin and went on their separate missions. Duclos reconnoitred by bicycle. He collected information on Nazi positions between Honfleur and Isigny. Without permission, he recruited a local civil engineer, F\u00e9lix Bruneau, to operate an \"action sector\" to create a climate of insecurity amongst the Wehrmacht. He went to Paris, where he created the Saint-Jacques network at his own premises at the Place Vend\u00f4me. In mid-August, he asked disaffected commandant Jean V\u00e9rines, a veteran of World War I, to be his lieutenant; V\u00e9rines' son, Guy, also joined the Saint-Jacques network. Between them, they recruited large numbers from La Garde (republican guards), gendarmes and sapeurs-pompiers (army fire crews) across northern France. Duclos also laid plans for  the Paris Job network and then helped Renault to found the Confr\u00e9rie Notre-Dame network.\nConsolidation and Vichy contacts\nHe met a former colleague from La Cagoule, journalist Gabriel Jeantet, who was now director of propaganda in the Vichy r\u00e9gime. Jeantet introduced him to others in the regime and contacts were maintained for the duration of the Nazi occupation. Duclos crossed between the Zone occup\u00e9e and the Zone libre adding contacts for his networks, particularly those working in railway infrastructure and utilities such as electricity distribution. He entered Spain in November via Perpignan before returning to London on 24 December.:\u200a74\u201375\u200a\nPlaque at the H\u00f4tel Delpech de Chaunot, Paris, commemorating the first French Resistance radio link between Paris and London, created by the first Resistance network,Saint-Jacques.\nHis report to Dewavrin of the Vichy organisation was not as favourable as that of Fourcaud, despite the useful connexions he'd made; he did not regard Vichy staff as combative enough. Nonetheless, Dewavrin was happy that three networks had been installed. He instructed Duclos to develop the network in the region between Paris, Caen and Dunkirk to gain as much information as possible about the Armistice Commission headquartered in Wiesbaden. In February 1941, he was dropped from a bomber over the Dordogne but broke one leg and sprained the other landing in woods. He made it to a farm but the doctor called by the farmer reported him to the police. He was arrested and taken to hospital in P\u00e9rigueux. Within a month he was released, with the help of Fourcaud contacting old colleagues in Vichy. He made it to the Zone occup\u00e9e, aided by a contact of Renault, and in Paris by April, he set up a radio link to London.:\u200a74\u201375\u200a\nCompromise and collapse\nV\u00e9rines had become very active amongst the gendarmerie but also recruited civilians, including abbot fr:Roger Derry. From his home in Neuilly, Duclos ran his network. He took Charles Deguy as an assistant, whose job in an oil company on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es provided key contacts and enabled him to cross the demarcation line with British military staff in the boot of his car. Reports were also sent by Roger Wybot from within the Vichy set-up who made links with Fourcaud and Saint-Jacques and saved many agents from arrest. Duclos went to Nantes in mid-June. He suspected his radio operator was a traitor and asked to use Renault's operator to transmit messages. Duclos' operator eventually gave details of all the Saint-Jacques members to the Nazis.:\u200a75\u201376\u200a\nOn 8 August, the Gestapo set a trap at the home of Saint-Jacques operative Marcel Halbout in Rouen, which led to the unravelling of the network through August and September. Renault evaded the trap. Duclos had only just returned from installing an antenna at Le Havre, became suspicious around Halbout's home and ",

    "Indian playwright and director (born 1957)\nMenino Fernandes (born 17 February 1957), known professionally as Menino De Bandar, is an Indian playwright, theatre director, singer, composer, and actor known for his work in tiatr and khell tiatr (street play) productions.\nEarly life\nMenino Fernandes was born on 17 February 1957 in Benaulim, Goa, which was part of Portuguese India, during the Portuguese Empire, to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Fernandes, a tailor, and Ana Severina Fernandes, a homemaker, in a Goan Catholic family. He grew up with four siblings: two sisters, Anunciacao (born 1951) and Teresa (born 1953), and two brothers, Antonio (born 1947) and Pascoal (born 1960). Fernandes's family background included involvement in Contradance, a regional song and dance tradition featuring ankle bracelets. Contradans bears similarities to the folk dance known as zagor, though the latter is sometimes associated with more risqu\u00e9 or vulgar lyrical content.\nFernandes inherited musical and performative talents from his father Jos\u00e9, who was active in the Contradance tradition. Beginning at the age of 15, Fernandes initially exhibited his vocal prowess by performing at various school functions, such as commemorations for the principal's birthday. During his childhood, he actively took part in school theatrical productions and musical concerts. As he matured, he expanded his performative repertoire to include roles in village \"khells\" - traditional dramatic presentations. Fernandes transitioned to khell writing, eventually composing his own original khells and khell tiatrs, a Goan form of folk theatre.\nCareer\nFernandes rose to prominence in the street plays (zomnivhele khell) tradition beginning in his late teenage years. From the age of 17 onward, he wrote and produced his own original street plays, which he and a troupe of performers would present shows or performances in the vicinity of private residences. Each performance, or \"act\" (parti), of Fernandes' plays was priced at \u20b910 (equivalent to \u20b9300 or US$3.60 in 2023) for the audience. In his debut street play Bhikari (Beggar), Fernandes overcame parental apprehension by using white quicklime or brick dust to paint his and his fellow performers' faces. The production was presented in a cowshed located within a household that housed cattle. After this debut, Fernandes crafted theatrical works comprising three acts specifically for street shows held during carnival celebrations. He organized a troupe of performers to enact these productions, referred to as khell. While he wrote and directed his own original works, he did not appear as an actor in plays created by others, preferring to focus on his skills as a playwright. His street plays gained popularity, and he began entering them in competitions. In these contests, Fernandes earned multiple awards in recognition of his writing and production abilities within the zomnivhele khell tradition.\nFernandes is known for his distinctive approach to theatrical production. In the early stages of his career, he eschewed the use of written scripts, instead opting to verbally explain the plot of each play to his actors. The performers would then interpret and enact to his oral instructions, with the plays becoming \"refined and polished\" through repeated performances. Fernandes also incorporated original musical compositions into his theatrical works, with the songs reflecting the themes of the plays. His songs often conclude with an \"opari\", (sayings or proverbs). This innovative approach proved popular with audiences, who responded positively to the minimal use of written material, as only the basic cants (songs) and plot summaries were formally documented.\nFor the first fifteen years of his career, Fernandes was able to stage his productions without relying on formal written scripts. It was only later that he began to incorporate scripted elements into a small number of his plays. His theatrical debut was a single-act play titled Noxib ani Tufan (Luck and Storm), which he presented in 1978. Following this initial production, he went on to write and stage several additional plays and non stop dramas. Some of his popular works include Duddu ani Ginean (Money and Knowledge), Soccorina (1984), Ho Uzo Paloiat (Put Out This Fire), Ghara Ea (Come Home), Khorench Hanv Fattim Paulom, etc. These works  experienced commercial success, with several surpassing 100 individual performances. Soccorina stood out by achieving 215 shows within the first year of its debut.

    "Species of flowering plant\nCryptocarya melanocarpa is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae and is endemic to north Queensland. It is a tree with elliptic to oblong to lance-shaped leaves, creamy green, unpleasantly perfumed flowers, and spherical black drupes.\nDescription\nCryptocarya melanocarpa is a tree that typically grows to a height of up to 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft), its stems sometimes buttressed. Its leaves are hairy, glaucous, elliptic to oblong to lance-shaped, 65\u2013135\u00a0mm (2.6\u20135.3\u00a0in) long and 20\u201355\u00a0mm (0.8\u20132.2\u00a0in) wide, on a petiole 8\u201316\u00a0mm (0.31\u20130.63\u00a0in) long. The flowers are arranged in panicles mainly in leaf axils or on the ends of branches and are usually shorter than the leaves. They are creamy-green and unpleasantly perfumed. The perianth tube is 1.0\u20131.1\u00a0mm (0.04\u20130.04\u00a0in) long and 1.0\u20131.4\u00a0mm (0.039\u20130.055\u00a0in) wide. The outer anthers are 0.5\u20130.7\u00a0mm (0.02\u20130.03\u00a0in) long, 0.4\u20130.5\u00a0mm (0.016\u20130.020\u00a0in) wide and glabrous, the inner anthers 0.5\u20130.8\u00a0mm (0.02\u20130.03\u00a0in) long and about 0.4\u00a0mm (0.02\u00a0in) wide. Flowering occurs from January to March, and the fruit is a spherical or flattened spherical, black drupe, about 8\u201310\u00a0mm (0.3\u20130.4\u00a0in) long and 9.0\u201310.5\u00a0mm (0.35\u20130.41\u00a0in) wide with white or sometimes cream coloured cotyledons.\nTaxonomy\nCryptocarya melanocarpa was first formally described in 1989 by Bernard Hyland in Australian Systematic Botany from specimens he collected near the Gillies Highway in 1983. The specific epithet (melanocarpa) means 'black-fruited'.\nDistribution and habitat\nCryptocarya melanocarpa grows in rainforest at altitudes between 700 and 1,100\u00a0m (2,300 and 3,600\u00a0ft) between the Windsor Tableland and Millaa Millaa in north Queensland.\nConservation status\nThis Cryptocarya species is listed as of \"least concern\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992.\nReferences\n^ \"Cryptocarya melanocarpa\".

    "British psychiatrist\nGill Livingston is a British psychiatrist and Professor of Psychiatry of Older People at University College London. Her research involves a life-course analysis of dementia risk and the development of strategies to delay or prevent dementia. She creates evidence-based interventions to improve the lives of people living with dementia and their families.\nEarly life and education\nLivingston's grandmother emigrated from Eastern Europe to Scotland in the early 1900s. Her father was the first in her family to go to university. Livingston studied medicine at the University of Glasgow. She specialised in psychiatry after a placement in Friern Hospital. Livingston became interested in dementia during her work as clinical psychiatrist, where she observed the difference that family carers made to the prognosis of dementia patients. This motivation to specialise in dementia strengthened after watching both of her parents struggle with the condition; her father developed progressive supranuclear palsy and dementia in the 2000s and her mother in the 2010s. Her first senior house officer position was at the Royal Free Hospital.\nResearch and career\nLivingston is an interdisciplinary researcher who combines psychiatry, epidemiological and biopsychosocial enquiry. She was made a professor of Old Age Psychiatry in 2007. Her research investigates new modifiable risk factors for dementia risk, the impact of hearing impairments, and how to help the families of people living with dementia.  She led The Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care. She combines new research with meta analysis to develop better understanding of dementia risk. Her research has influenced UK and US policy on dementia risk, and revealed evidence-based interventions that could improve the lives of people with dementia.\nShe pioneered the STrAtegies for RelaTives (START) programme, an 8 session intervention that helps the carers of people with dementia develop coping strategies. START increases the quality of life and reduces incidence of depression amongst the carers of people living with dementia. She also launched the MARQUE project, a 5-year programme that looked to understand agitation, dementia and how to achieve culture change in care homes. In 2024 she reported that half of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by addressing various risk factors, particularly high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or \"bad\" cholesterol, social isolation and lower levels of education.\nSelect publications\nGill Livingston; Jonathan Huntley; Andrew Sommerlad; et\u00a0al.

    "Al-Mina'a SC 2024\u201325 football season\nThe 2024\u201325 season will be Al-Minaa's second season in the newly-formed Iraq Stars League, and their 48th season in the top division of Iraq football.\nReview\nBackground\nAfter Al-Minaa Club entered into an administrative crisis last season, as FIFA imposed a ban on contracting players, it was forced to play with the academy players. Despite all the difficulties, it was able to ensure its survival in the Iraq Stars League since the 35th round and finished the league in 12th place, which was considered a football miracle. However, coach Hassan Ahmed apologized for continuing with the team and withdrew after the end of the season. So the club's newly elected management began contracting with Spanish coach Pablo Grandes in 29 July to prepare a team that would compete for the league.\nSummer transfer window\nThe summer transfer window opened on 2 August 2024. Al-Minaa announced from the first day the renewal of the contract of right back Hameed Ali Hameed.\nOn 5 August, Al-Minaa announced the signing of three professional players and the renewal of two local players. The club signed 22-year-old Tunisian attacking midfielder Abdallah Amri from Tunisian club CS Sfaxien, 25-year-old Gabonese international defensive midfielder Clech Loufilou from Omani club Sur, and 23-year-old Swedish left winger of Iraqi origin Hamid Abdulla from Swedish club Roseng\u00e5rd. The club also renewed the contracts of goalkeeper Jaafar Shenaishil and midfielder Ayad Abed Farhan.\nOn 7 August, the club renewed the contract of the team's goalkeeper and the U-17 national team, Ammar Ali, and on 8 August, it renewed the contract of the right winger, Sajjad Alaa, and announced the signing of the Congolese right winger, Tuisila Kisinda, coming from the Moroccan club, RS Berkane. On 9 August, the club renewed the contract of defensive midfielder Haidar Salem.\nOn 10 August, coach Pablo Grandes arrived in Basra from Spain with his assistant Iv\u00e1n McCarroll to officially lead the Al-Minaa team. He was introduced to the media as the coach of Al-Minaa, and he said in the press conference that he wanted to compete for advanced positions in the league and that he chose Al-Minaa because it is the oldest club among the Iraqi clubs and that he would work to create a competitive team.\nOn 12 August, the club announced the signing of Spanish striker Lolo Pl\u00e1 from Spanish club, Talavera. The contract of central midfielder Mohammed Khudair was also renewed, as was the contract of centre back Hussein Amer after his return from a loan to Naft Maysan.\nOn 13 August, the club announced the signing of Zimbabwean centre back Gerald Takwara from Saudi club Ohod. Centre back Mohammed Ghaleb's contract was also renewed, as was goalkeeper Abed Saleem Hammad's contract after he returned from loan to Amanat Baghdad. On August 15, 16 and 17, the contracts of defenders Mojtaba Ali and Abbas Yas and striker Salem Ahmed were renewed. On 18 August, the club renewed the contracts of left-back Muslim Mousa and left-winger Karrar Jaafar, and a day later announced the signing of midfielder Amir Ahmed from Al-Naft. On 21 August, the club renewed the contract of right-back Karrar Al-Amir Ali.\nOn 26 August , the club announced the signing of striker Mohannad Abdul-Raheem from Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya. It also announced the signing of Spanish right-back Ra\u00fal Parra from Portuguese club Estoril.\nFirst-team squad\nAs of 22 August 2024\nNew contracts and transfers\nNew contracts\nTransfers in\nTransfers out\nPersonnel\nTechnical staff\nExternal links\nAl-Minaa SC Results at FIFA.COM\nReferences\n^ \"\"\u0628\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0640\"\u0641\u064a\u0641\u0627\".. \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u064a\u062f\u062e\u0644 \u062f\u0648\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u064011 \u0644\u0627\u0639\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0641\u0642\u0637\". shafaq.com (in Arabic).

    "Species of flowering plant\nCalytrix decussata is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family Myrtaceae and is endemic to the Northern Territory. It is a shrub with linear to lance-shaped leaves and pinkish-mauve flowers arranged singly or in scatter groups with about 45 to 50 white stamens that become reddish-purple as the flower ages.\nDescription\nCalytrix decussata is a shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 1.5\u00a0m (4\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in). Its leaves are decussate, linear to lance-shaped and covered with matted hairs, 1.5\u20134\u00a0mm (0.059\u20130.157\u00a0in) long, 0.25\u20130.75\u00a0mm (0.0098\u20130.0295\u00a0in) wide and sessile. There is a stipule up to 0.1\u00a0mm (0.0039\u00a0in) long at the base of the leaves. The flowers are arranged singly or in small groups scattered along the branches. The floral tube has 10 ribs and is 7\u20139\u00a0mm (0.28\u20130.35\u00a0in) long. The sepals are joined at the base, with more or less round to egg-shaped lobes, 1.5\u20132.0\u00a0mm (0.059\u20130.079\u00a0in) long and 1.5\u20132.5\u00a0mm (0.059\u20130.098\u00a0in) wide with an awn up to 12\u00a0mm (0.47\u00a0in) long. The petals are pinkish-mauve at first, and white at the base, elliptic, 5.0\u20136.5\u00a0mm (0.20\u20130.26\u00a0in) long and 1.5\u20133.0\u00a0mm (0.059\u20130.118\u00a0in) wide, later becoming deep purplish-mauve.

    "An upcoming roller coaster at Kings Dominion\nRapterra is an upcoming steel launched wing roller coaster at Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia.\n Once open, it will become the world's tallest and longest-launched wing roller coaster.\nHistory\nRemoval of Volcano\nSee also: Volcano: The Blast Coaster\nVolcano: The Blast Coaster was an inverted launched coaster that operated at the park from 1998 to early 2018, situated inside of the preceding Smurf Mountain structure. \nIn February 2019, Kings Dominion announced that Volcano had been decommissioned, citing issues with reliability, rider capacity, and overall customer satisfaction. By May of the same year, the entire attraction had been fully demolished.\nThe removal of Volcano left a sizable empty site in the park, sparking discussions for a replacement as early as 2019; it was then that Bolliger & Mabillard first drafted a wing coaster layout for the land. However, the park's closure during 2020 per the COVID-19 pandemic and retirement of The Crypt after the 2019 season contributed to Tumbili taking priority as a replacement for the latter. The coaster opened in March 2022, bringing with it the reimagining of Safari Village as Jungle X-Pedition and thematic foundation for future attractions.\nPreparation & Construction\nPlans were submitted to Hanover County, Virginia in December 2023 for the construction of Amendment 47, a new roller coaster project to be located where Volcano: The Blast Coaster previously stood. Construction had already commenced when the park opened for the season in March 2023, with groundwork in full swing and the first concrete foundations being poured.\nRoller coaster steel \u2013 including track and supports \u2013 began arriving at the end of May, with the first piece of brake run being placed on June 18, 2024.  Installation continued from there, with the tallest point of the ride being topped off at 8:22am on July 28.\nAnnouncement\nKings Dominion began promoting their mystery attraction during construction, with various teasers and clues gradually appearing around its work fences. On July 31, 2024, Kings Dominion officially announced Rapterra for the 2025 season.\nCharacteristics\nRapterra will be 145 feet (44\u00a0m) tall, 3,086 feet (941\u00a0m) long, and reaches a top speed of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) throughout the ride. The coaster will run two 20-passenger trains, arranging riders in 5 rows with a pair on each side.\nReferences\n^ a b Kolenich, Eric (2024-07-31). \"Kings Dominion gets approval to build new roller coaster\".

    "Hungarian-American hazzan, composer, and scholar\nMax (Moshe) Wohlberg (born February 9, 1907) was a Hungarian-American hazzan, composer, and scholar. He was one of the initial members of the Cantors Assembly established in 1947 and served as its president from 1949 to 1951. He helped to found the cantorial school at the Jewish Theological Seminary where he was Professor and head of the nusach department. Self-taught, he developed a curriculum for studying nusach and producing scholarly research, educating over 100 graduates as of 1977.\nWohlberg was known for his recitative compositions and recognized as a melodist who captured the interpretive nuances of liturgical texts. His music was rooted in Jewish liturgical traditions, incorporating biblical cantillations, synagogue motifs, Yiddish song phrases, and Israeli folk melodies. These influences stemmed from his extensive exposure to Jewish musical life and were further enriched by his teaching and research.\nWohlberg died April 19, 1996, in Washington D.C.\nReferences\n^ \"Max Wohlberg\". www.ashbournemusicpublishing.com.

    "God's Kingdom Society (GKS) (Church of the Living God) is a Christian sabbatarian denomination founded by Gideon Urhobo. He served as its life president from its inception in 1934 till his passing in 1952.\nHistory\nOrigins\nGideon Urhobo was influenced by some of the teachings of the Jehovah's Witnesses, but developed his own conviction in his mission after a vision from Jesus Christ in 1934. He disagreed with certain teachings of the Jehovah's Witnesses, leading him to split from the organization and start his own Society in Lagos called \"the Lagos Division of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\". He began to criticize not only the Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs, but also the Muslim faith and mainline churches. He later renamed his group the \"Lagos Company of Christian People\" and expanded to Port Harcourt. The name was changed to the \"Nigerian Christian Society\" in 1942, and to God's Kingdom Society (GKS) in 1943.\nSuccession\nAfter the passing of Gideon Urhobo on February 25, 1952, his vice-president, Bro. Ebenezer T. Otomewo became the president of GKS. Under Otomewo, the Church spread to most cities in Nigeria and London. He died in April 1997.  Four years later, on September 1, 2001, Bro. Emmanuel Oseghale Aighalua (then aged 39) was installed as president. The third president was removed on March 18, 2011. On Sunday, March 27, 2016, Brother Godwin O. Ifeacho became the president and served until his passing on Thursday, April 22, 2021. On Sunday, February 27, 2022, Brother Felix Ekundayo Adedokun was installed as president.\nSplits\nGod's Kingdom Mission split from God's Kingdom Society on January 5, 1991, through the efforts of Brother Benjamin O. Tietie, who served as the first Archminister of the Mission.  Pastor David O. Amanoritsewo also broke away to form the Acceptable Christian Church, with similar doctrines as those of God's Kingdom Society (GKS).\nSpread\nThe God's Kingdom Society (GKS) spread from Warri in Delta State to many parts of Nigeria as a sabbatical movement with doctrine which resembles the Jehovah's Witnesses. It grew into hundreds of members by the 1950s. Saint Urhobo founded Church branches in Lagos (1934), Port Harcourt (1940), Warri, and Sapele (1942), followed by Onitsha (1946) and Aba (1948). It was involved in the struggle for the independence of Nigeria in the 1950s. By the 1960s, it grew to over 2,000 members.   GKS has grown to have followers in Nigeria, Liberia, Ghana, North America, Benin  and England.\nInterventions\nDuring the inter-ethnic crisis that shook Warri in 1998 and 2003, the God's Kingdom Society was instrumental in putting an end to the violence and brotherly war by issuing two distinct statements on Tuesday, November 17, 1998, and August 19, 2003.\nDoctrine of GKS\nThe majority of the Watchtower Society's liturgy and beliefs are observed by God's Kingdom Society, these include rejecting \"speaking in tongues,\"; defining the Holy Spirit as \"the invisible, active force of God,\"; believing that Jesus was born in October; avoiding interfaith relations; opposing racism, and only baptizing adults. God's Kingdom Society also accepts the idea that 144,000 chosen and anointed Christians will be selected to live and reign with Christ in heaven. But there are many differences. The Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the establishing of God's Kingdom on earth are highly valued concepts in God's Kingdom Society. The tale of G.K.S.'s battles with various movements and institutions is heavily influenced by both secular and religious factors. The Society holds that it has been tasked by God with exposing the \"false\" beliefs of other religious organizations and that it is in possession of the truth of God's word, which must be conveyed to all peoples. The G.K.S. is always prepared to combat atheism on behalf of God and its interpretation of Christianity. Because of this, the Society has occasionally engaged in polemics with politicians and their parties. The religious group has been known to observe a week-long Feast of Tabernacles. They do not celebrate Christmas.\nReferences\n^ a b \"God's Kingdom Society\". Oxford Reference. Retrieved 2024-04-22.\n^ a b \"Gods Kingdom Society | Encyclopedia.com\". www.encyclopedia.com.

    "Heat event caused by polar vortex weakening\nThe 2024 Antarctica heat wave refers to a prolonged and significant mid-winter increase in Antarctic temperatures compared to prior winters, causing several regions of Antarctica to reach temperatures 10\u00a0\u00b0C (18.0\u00a0\u00b0F) above normal in July 2024, up to a 28\u00a0\u00b0C (50.4\u00a0\u00b0F) increase above average. The heat wave was significant for occurring during the middle of the Antarctic winter when little to no sunlight shines on the continent, and temperatures are annually at their lowest historically.\nBackground\nIn March 2022, a heat wave struck Antarctica that reached 39\u00a0\u00b0C (70.2\u00a0\u00b0F) above average. The increased heat led to a portion of an ice sheet that was roughly \"the size of Rome\" to fall apart into the Southern Ocean.\nThis heat wave lead to some regions of Antarctica facing temperatures that were up to 22\u00a0\u00b0C (39.6\u00a0\u00b0F) higher than normal and caused significantly reduced levels of sea ice, leading to extensive research on the event by a major global research project consisting of 54 members, who described the complexity of the heat wave's cause as \"head-hurting\".\nMeteorology\nModels from climate researchers mapping the areas of the world indicated that the regions most impacted by anthropogenic climate change would be on Earth's poles in the Arctic and the Antarctic. Prior increases in temperatures in these regions have led to the collapse of Antarctic ice sheets that in turn significantly contribute to rising global sea levels.\nClimate researchers found that a weakening in the Antarctic polar vortex, a \"band of cold air and low pressure that spins in the stratosphere around each pole\", was the primary cause of the heat wave. Atmospheric scientist Amy Butler reported that the weakening of the polar vortex was caused by atmospheric waves interfering with the vortex, meaning that higher altitude regions in the Antarctic were more susceptible to elevated temperatures. The disturbances in the polar vortex also caused \"massive\" quantities of freezing air to be pushed toward the equator, causing unseasonably colder temperatures and cold fronts throughout the Southern Hemisphere, including the Southern Cone of South America, New Zealand, and Australia. MetDesk director Michael Dukes noted that 2024's El Ni\u00f1o was a significant contributor to increased Antarctic temperatures in addition to anthropogenic climate change.\nETH Z\u00fcrich climate researcher Jonathan Wille attributed the heatwave to a \"really rare\" several week long \u201csouthern stratospheric warming event\u201d across the continent. University of Washington atmospheric scientist Edward Blanchard believed that warmer temperatures in the Southern Ocean and decreased sea ice around Antarctica further increased the susceptibility of Antarctica to warmer temperatures during its winter.\nHeat wave\nIn July 2024, a heat wave stuck most of Antarctica, primarily in the Eastern and Central regions of the continent. Average temperatures were at \u22124\u00a0\u00b0C (24.8\u00a0\u00b0F), extensively higher than average winter temperatures, especially for the time typically associated with Antarctica's coldest annual temperatures. As a result, the Southern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent as plotted on a University of Maine Climate Reanalyzer graph reached its second lowest area having at least 15% ice cover on record for its respective day of the year, with only 2023 having a lower area that time of year. Extrapolation of the graph indicated that 2024 would soon surpass 2023 as the lowest ice cover recorded, potentially in August 2024. Decreased ice cover was reported to cause a feedback loop involving more sunlight absorbed in areas with less ice cover, further contributing to warming surface temperature and greater areas of melted ice.\nClimate researchers predicted that average East Antarctic temperatures from 3 August to 13 August would persist at 36 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit above average, higher than temperatures in the last week of July 2024 that were 12\u00a0\u00b0C (21.6\u00a0\u00b0F) above average. The Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station recorded its warmest average July temperature since 2002 at 6.3\u00a0\u00b0C (11.3\u00a0\u00b0F) above average, with an average temperature of \u221247.6\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221253.7\u00a0\u00b0F) from 20 to 30 July, meeting the average February Antarctic temperature at the typical end of summer. Vostok, in the center of Antarctica's ice sheet, also recorded its warmest average July temperature since 2009, at 6.4\u00a0\u00b0C (11.5\u00a0\u00b0F) above average.\nForecasting director of MetDesk Michael Dukes stated that in addition to recordings of exceptionally high daily temperatures at several individual locations, there was a significantly prolonged rise in average temperatures throughout July 2024, which was more impactful towards the melting of ice. Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather stated that the Antarctic heat wave was a primary contributor to the hottest days of the planet in meteorological history recorded during July 2024. University of Washington atmospheric scientist Edward Blanchard called the heat wave a \"n",
    "A girl reading from a chalkboard in Mogadishu\nSomalia is a nation on the Horn of Africa with a population of approximately 18 million people. As of 2022, the country has an adult literacy rate of about 41%. There is a significant gender disparity in literacy rate, with 54% of men and only 22% of women being literate. According to USAID, the youth literacy rate is approximately 70%. The official languages of Somalia are Somali and Arabic, with English and Italian used as well.\nFactors in literacy\nEducation in Somalia is not widespread, with nearly 85% of children not enrolled in school according to USAID. The nation has a lower secondary education completion rate of 19.5%. Somalia's relatively poor education and low literacy rates have largely been attributed to the effects of the ongoing Somali Civil War, which began around 1991.

    "\nThe Dutch Association of Journalists (Dutch: Nederlandse Vereniging van Journalisten, NVJ) is a national trade union for journalists, part of the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions. Anyone who fits the description of journalist in the broadest sense of the term can be a member. This includes reporters, investigative journalists, photographers, editors and producers. Both those who work full-time or part-time in any of these capacities are members. The association publishes the Villamedia Magazine, focused on journalism news.\nThe aims of the association are to defend the freedom of the press against governmental and other threats, as well as to defend and improve the work conditions of journalists. The association also strives to defend and maintain journalistic integrity and ethics. It provides legal aid to its members, gives out press cards, and takes part in conflict-resolution between journalists and their employers, and engages in strike action.\nAs of November 2023 the chair of the NVJ is Folkert Jensma, former editor-in-chief of the NRC, who was elected with 95% of the vote. Rowan Blijd was elected vice-chair.\nHistory\nIn 1884 the Dutch Journalist Circle (Dutch: Nederlandse Journalisten Kring, NJK) was founded by A.G.C. van Duyl senior, then editor in chief of the Algemeen Dagblad. The NJK's aim was to increase solidarity among journalists and serve as a platform for them to discuss and advance their interests.\nIn 1898 prominent journalist, theologian and future Prime Minister Abraham Kuyper became chair of the NJK, greatly raising its reputation and influence. \nDue to the pillarization of the Netherlands at the time, Catholics and Protestants set up their own alternative journalistic associations in the years after the NJK's founding. However, the NJK remained the largest and most influential, with the Catholic association having 14 publications as its members in 1902 as opposed to the 250 members of the NJK.\nIn 1949 the various journalistic associations decided to cooperate in the Federation of Dutch Journalists (FNJ), which in 1968, with the erosion of pillarization, combined to form the NVJ.\nReferences\n^ a b Weaver, David H.; Willnat, Lars (2020-10-25).

    "Frederick Hans Haagensen (23 September 1877\u201314 May 1943 ) was an Anglo-Norwegian visual artist and graphic artist. He often used the signature FH Haagensen. His attraction to nature and the sea can be traced back to his childhood memories of wandering the rural landscape of the estuary of the River Humber.\nLife and work\nHaagensen was born in the English town of Grimsby in Lincolnshire in 1877 to Norwegian parents Peter Hendrik Haagensen (1837\u20131919) and Janna Haagensen (1837\u20131897). His father was a Norwegian shipowner who traded in timber and coal, and was for a time Norwegian and Swedish consul in Grimsby. The son regularly accompanied his father on business trips between Norway and Grimsby. His artistic education began with tutoring in Florence, and then with extensive travels to Scandinavia, Russia and the Baltic states to West Africa, Spain and Cuba. In 1899 at St James' Church in Grimsby he married Wilhelmina Grange Stephenson (1878\u20131965). The marriage was later dissolved.\nHe eventually settled in England, moving to Chelsea where he worked and lived with his English second wife, the artist Audrey Margherita Archer n\u00e9e Bussell (1900\u20131994), whom he married in 1932. Here he lived in the 1920s and after with his wife and children during the 1930s. He worked mainly with oil painting, watercolour, and charcoal, but also began to experiment with etchings. Eventually it became a medium he preferred even though he started it late in life, aged forty-seven. He had exhibitions as a graphic artist in New York, Boston and London, and his work was purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, British Museum, Manchester Art Gallery and by private collectors. He travelled repeatedly from England to Norway to paint and draw nature there.\nAfter discovering an older house in the Old Dutch style during a cycling trip in Essex, he decided to move there with his family. For the last seven years of his life he lived in the small village of Bradwell-on-Sea. After his death in Chelmsford in Essex he was buried in the old churchyard at Bradwell-on-Sea. His wife Audrey Haagensen organized after his death several exhibitions of his pictures in Grimsby, Kendal, Southend-on-Sea, Chelmsford, at The Minories, Colchester in 1972, at Little Baddow Hall Arts Centre in 1974 and at the Loughton House Gallery in London in 1977. She also arranged an exhibition of his artwork in Oslo in his old homeland; \"For,\" stated Mrs. Haagensen, \"despite his birth in Grimsby, he was of pure Norwegian blood.\" The Munch Museum bought several of his pictures. In 1977 she published a book of his etchings to mark the centenary of his birth.\nExhibitions\n1926: The Studio, Wellington Street, Chelsea, London ;\n1928: The Kew Gallery, USA\n1929: The Shervee Gallery, Boston, USA; Abbey Gallery, London; 14 Great Stanhope Street, London;\n1972: The Minories, Colchester, Essex; The Galeria, Maldon, Essex;\n1974: The Little Baddow Hall Arts Centre, Essex;\n1976: PS Tattershall Castle Art Gallery,  London;\n1977: Beercroft Gallery, Southend-on-Sea, Essex; Loughton House Gallery, London; Oslo Art Association, Norway; Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery, Yorkshire; Grimsby Art Gallery,  Lincolnshire.\nBibliography\n1978: Haagensen, LYC Museum Banks, Brampton Cumbria\n1976: Catalogue: Frederick Hans 1877-1943, The Butterfly Press, Malden Essex\nHaverkamp, Frode (1986): Oslo kunstforening 1936-1986.

    "Austrian-American candy maker\nLeo Hirschfield was an German-American candymaker known as the inventor of the Tootsie Roll, the first individually wrapped penny candy, and Bromangelon, the first commercially successful gelatin dessert mix, which preceded Jell-O by two years.\nEarly life\nHirschfield was an Austrian Jewish immigrant to the United States of America, the son of an Austrian candy maker.\nCareer\nIn 1895, Hirschfield created Bromangelon, the first commercially successful gelatin dessert mix.\nDetails of his early career are disputed. The more common version has him starting a candy shop in Brooklyn that later merged with Stern & Saalberg. Another version has him starting at the factory and rising to a senior development position. According to the Tootsie Industries' official company history, he started his own career in the candy business at a small shop or factory in New York City in 1896. However, this version of events, which is repeated in sources such as the Cleveland Jewish News, is disputed by Rutgers University Professor Emerita Samira Kawash, who addressed the conflicting origins of the candy on her blog Candy Professor. Citing a 1913 Pittsburgh Press interview, Kawash states that Hirschfield had been working for Stern & Staalberg before moving to Manhattan to work there in the early 1890s. He invented the candy in 1907, and named it after his then-5-year-old daughter Clara, whose nickname was \"Tootsie.\" He appied for a patent on the unique texture of Tootsie Rolls that same year and was awarded one in 1908. Stern & Staalberg began marketing Tootsie Rolls a year later. Kawash concluded from the patents issued for the candy between 1907 and 1908 that the invention of Tootsie Rolls in 1896 in Hirschfeld's Brooklyn candy store was a myth. In addition, Kawash points out that Tootsie was also the name of the child spokesperson for Bromangelon, leading Kawash to surmise that while the Tootsie Roll may have been \"christened\" in Clara's honor, she first \"did her time as the child spokes-model for fruity gelatin.\"\nBefore the adoption of modern refrigeration technology, candy sellers would spend hot summers selling candy that did not easily melt, such as taffy and marshmallows. This precluded chocolate, which melts easily. Since Tootsie had a nominally chocolate taste, it was a first for summer candies. Its patent describes that the moderately hard texture of Tootsie \u2014 in contrast to the light, porous texture of other pulled candies \u2014 was achieved by baking it at a low temperature for about two hours, giving it \"a peculiar mellow consistency\" that maintained its shape and did not melt. It was the first penny candy to be individually wrapped, and its low price led to its remarkable growth, making it a Depression-era favorite. During World War II, when the need for shipping food that did not spoil quickly to battlefront soldiers prompted considerable development in the field of processed food, Tootsie Rolls, which stayed fresh for a long period of time, became part of soldiers' ration packs, further solidifying Americans' love for the candy.\nHirschfield left the company in 1922, shortly before his death.\nDeath\nBy early 1922, Hirschfield was wealthy, and his businesses were doing well. However, he was despondent over his long illness and his wife's mental breakdown, which left her committed in a sanitarium. On January 13, 1922, he took a revolver and intentionally killed himself via a gunshot to the head. He left a note stating that he was \"sorry, but could not help it.\" He was survived by his daughter, who was married to an Arthur Ludwig.\nReferences\n^ a b Fernandez, Manny (August 7, 2010). \"Let Us Now Praise the Great Men of Junk Food\".

    "\nNiels Henrik Cordulus Hoffmeyer (3 June 1836 \u2013 16 February 1884) was a Danish army officer who founded the Danish Meteorological Institute. He introduced synoptic weather maps into Denmark. They were known for sometime as Hoffmeyer maps.\nHoffmeyer was born in Copenhagen, the son of Colonel Andreas Brock Hoffmeyer. His brother was Julius Hoffmeyer. He went to school at the Land Cadet Academy and became a second lieutenant in 1853 and rose to the rank of captain in 1864 when he served in the Second Schleswig War. Being wounded he was sent to Paris where he studied French and became interested in meteorology. He noticed weather maps that had been introduced by Urbain Leverrier at the Paris observatory. He studied iron fabrication in Nantes and when he returned he worked at a foundry in  Christiansholm. In 1868 he joined the war ministry and became in charge of artillery reinforcement. On 1 April 1872 the Danish Meteorological Institute was founded as part of the naval ministry. He was appointed the first director where he made use of his statistical skills. He organized a network of volunteers and observation stations and using information gathered through telegraphic networks, he began to produce graphical summaries of the weather. From 1873 he started the Meteorological Bulletin of the North. He produced isobar charts of the north Atlantic region. He also helped establish magnetic stations in the north pole as secretary to the Polar Commission. He helped organize the first International Meteorological Congress serving as a secretary for the meeting in Rome in 1876.\nHoffmeyer was made Knight of the Dannebrog in 1878. He suffered from rheumatic heart disease and died in 1884 and was buried in the Assistens Cemetery. \nReferences\n^ Jewell, Ralph (1981). \"The Bergen School of Meteorology: The Cradle of modern weather-forecasting\".

    "Private security company in Angola\nTeleservice Sociedade de Seguran\u00e7a e Servi\u00e7os Lda, is the largest private security company in Angola. It counts many international oil companies among its clients including the state-owned Sonangol group.\nHistory\nTeleservice was founded in 1993 as a private military company charged with protecting the Angolan mining and oil sectors during the Angolan Civil War. It was a partnership between several former Angolan military leaders; Joaquim Duarte da Costa David, former director of Sonangol; and Gray Security Services Ltd, a South African security firm with connections to the mercenary company Executive Outcomes, which operated in Angola until December 31, 1998, when South African citizens were banned from participating in foreign conflicts. The officers involved included:\nGeneral Ant\u00f3nio dos Santos Fran\u00e7a, who was then President of DeBeers Angola (10% stake)\nGeneral Jo\u00e3o de Matos, former Chief of General Staff of the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) (10% stake)\nGeneral Lu\u00eds Pereira Faceira, former Chief of General Staff of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) (9% stake)\nGeneral Ant\u00f3nio Emilio Faceira, commander of the Special Forces Commando Battalion, formerly of FAPLA then of FAA (8% stake)\nGeneral Armando da Cruz Neto, then Governor of Benguela and former Chief of General Staff of the FAA (7%)\nGeneral Paulo Pfluger Barreto Lara, then Inspector-General of the General Staff of the FAA (6%)\nGeneral Adriano Makevela Mackenzie, head of military training at the joint chiefs of staff of the FAA\nGeneral Carlos Alberto Hendrick Vaal da Silva, then Inspector-General of the General Staff of the FAA\nGeneral Manuel H\u00e9lder Vieira Dias, then Minister of State and head of the Intelligence Bureau at the Presidency\nIn 1995, the Divis\u00e3o Mar\u00edtima da TELESERVICE was created to perform security operations in rivers and offshore.\nIn 2002, Teleservice transitioned from a PMC to a civilian security company with a pivot away from armed security services.\nAs of October 2024, Teleservice employs more than 5,000 Angolans.\nCrimes against humanity, exposure, and coverup\nIn 2011, Angolan journalist and anti-corruption activist Rafael Marques published Diamantes de Sangue: Corrup\u00e7\u00e3o e Tortura em Angola (Blood Diamonds: Corruption and Torture in Angola), an expos\u00e9 alleging severe human rights violations by personnel of Teleservice, the FAA, and other private security companies protecting the operations of the diamond mining companies in the provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul. The expos\u00e9 included more than five hundred reports of massacres, murders, rapes, mutilations, extortion, corpse desecration, organ removal, beatings, torture, slavery, and similar abuses. Fran\u00e7a, de Matos, Lu\u00eds Faceira, Ant\u00f3nio Faceira, Neto, Lara, Mackenzie, da Silva, and Dias were all named both in the report and in a criminal complaint then filed by Marques. In December of that year, over 18,000 people in the region, including 3,000 in the town of Cafunfo, took place in political demonstrations demanding the withdrawal of Teleservice. Teleservice withdrew in March 2012.\nThe generals named in the report tried to press charges in 2013 in Portugal, where Diamantes de Sangue was published by Tinta da China, for defamation. The attorney general there dismissed the charges, as he felt the report was well-researched and credible.\nIn 2015, following Marques's receipt of an international journalism award, the generals pressed twenty-four charges of defamation against him in Angola, with a potential prison time of nine years and a fine in excess of $1,200,000. He was convicted of one, and given a six-month sentence deferred by two years, however Angolan authorities including Minister of the Interior \u00c2ngelo de Veiga Barros and Head of State Intelligence and Security Services Eduardo Filomeno Barber Leiro Octavio did recognize the existence of the human rights violations and material damages included in Marques's report. After an open statement by over 30 jewelers and press freedom and human rights NGOs in support of Marques, the charges against him were dropped under the provision that Diamantes de Sangue was not to be reprinted.\nServices\nTeleservice offers a variety of security-related services, including providing security for oil rigs and other offshore facilities, industrial security, property security, cash-in-transit services, VIP and personal security escorts, and security risk assessment and management services.\nClients\nTeleservice is or has been employed by the following clients:\nSonangol Group\nChevron-Texaco\nEsso\nHalliburton\nNorsk Hydro\nPetromar International\nSociedade Mineira do Cuango, which shared owners with Teleservice,\nTotalEnergies\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h Profile of the private security sector in Angola (Report).

    "Private security company in Angola\nAlfa 5 Seguran\u00e7a Industrial e Patrimonial SARL is a private security company in Angola. It is majority owned by ENDIAMA and holds over half of the security contracts with Angolan diamond companies.\nHistory\nAlfa 5 was founded in 1993 in partnership with senior or retired military officials or their close relatives for the purpose of providing security to ENDIAMA's diamond mines against criminals and UNITA rebels. These military and ex-military officials on the Alfa-5 board included then-General C\u00e9sar Pugliese, Rui Carlos Sousa Gaio, the wife of then-FAA chief-of-staff General Agostinho Fernandes Nelumba, and the brother of former FAA chief-of-staff General Jo\u00e3o de Matos. The name refers to five Portuguese-speaking African countries where its namers hoped it would eventually operate.\nSince its founding, Alfa 5 developed into a security company of its own, offering services to firms outside of ENDIAMA as well. By the late 90s, Alfa 5 was one of the largest security firms in Angola alongside Teleservice and K&P Mineira.\nIn 2021, ENDIAMA began looking to sell Alfa 5, but struggled to find a buyer.\nHuman rights abuses\nIn the early 2000s, employees of Alfa 5 were accused of multiple human rights abuses including unlawful killings of protesters, striking miners, and garimpeiros in places such as Luremo and Cuango, and of flexing connections to the military leaders on the Alfa 5 board to avoid consequences.\nIn response to this, General Director of Alfa 5 Francisco Borges Guerra said that Alfa 5's \"operations are decentralized,\" that its leadership did not give such orders, and that \"if the individuals should adopt that behavior, it is on their individual conscience. It is what happens a little in those areas. ... I don't believe that this behavior is generalized among our men, but I do not want to overlook those individual cases which could blemish the company\u2019s good name. We do have some sad examples.\"\nIn 2023, Alfa 5's Head of Commercial Development, Ant\u00f3nio Pedro Bartolomeu, told O Pa\u00eds reporters that Alfa 5 would like to hire ex-police and ex-military personnel to ensure better discipline, but there aren't enough available.\nServices\nAlfa 5 focuses on combining human security and electronic systems. It offers security for industrial sites and information centers, transportation of valuable cargo, demining, and security systems including alarms, armored doors, and safe deposit boxes.\nClients\nAlfa 5 reportedly has clients such as:\nEmpresa Nacional de Diamantes E.P. (ENDIAMA)\nSociedade de Desenvolvimento Mineiro de Angola (SDM)\nMinistry of Finance (MINFIN)\nAdministra\u00e7\u00e3o Geral Tribut\u00e1ria (AGT)\nNational Bank of Angola (BNA)\nCl\u00ednica Sagrada Esperan\u00e7a (CSE)\nReferences\n^ \"Angola: Company Profile Of Alfa 5 - WINNE - World Investment News\". www.winne.com.

    "American writer\nLeta Von Felden Myers Smart (March 15, 1893 \u2013 June 8, 1981) was an American writer, and a member of the Omaha people who was active on the national level for American Indian rights.\nEarly life\nMyers was born in Nebraska, the daughter of Garry P. Meyers and Dora Von Felden Meyers. Her father was a blacksmith and an alumnus of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Antonine Barada, an Omaha folk hero, was her great-grandfather. She described herself as a relative and former secretary of Omaha lawyer Thomas L. Sloan.\nMyers attended Hampton Institute from 1910 to 1912. She was denied admission at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School because she was less than a quarter Indian by ancestry. She was listed as 1/16 Omaha in the census of the Omaha Reservation taken in 1932.\nCareer\nSmart was active in the National Council of American Indians, and in the California Indian Rights Association. In 1923, she brought her newborn daughter to Washington, D.C., to demand that the Bureau of Indian Affairs be abolished. In 1931, she questioned the Indian affiliations of entertainer Big Chief White Horse Eagle, and he in turn questioned her Omaha identity. (She was later proven correct; White Horse Eagle was also known as John Delaney, a \"professional ethnic impersonator.\") She was especially active in establishing the full citizenship of Native Americans. \"She has little sympathy with those whose primary interest is the 'romance' of tribal Indian history,\" reported a Los Angeles paper in 1931, which quoted her as saying \"I am not nearly so much concerned over the shape of my grandfather's skull as I am over what is going to happen to me and my child.\"\nSmart spoke to community groups about laws affecting Indian rights. In 1937 and 1938, she testified at Congressional hearings on the land rights of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians, though members of the Band rejected her standing to testify about their business.  In 1945, she represented Los Angeles at the National Council of American Indians, held in Montana. In 1948, her involvement in a Navajo relief drive sponsored by Will Rogers Jr. came under scrutiny by the city of Los Angeles, particularly her eligibility to be paid by the campaign's funds.\nIn the 1950s, Smart led the successful effort to remove two statues, The Discovery of America and The Rescue, from the steps of the United States Capitol. She wrote many letters to the National Sculpture Society, arguing that the representations of Native Americans in these statues was disgraceful, shameful, and \"deplorable.\"\nPublications\n\"W-H-O\" (1920)\n\"On a Nickel\" (1921)\n\"A Picture\" (1921)\n\"A Young Man's Adventure with Opportunity\" (1922)\n\"The Last Rescue\" (1959, Harper's)\nPersonal life and legacy\nMyers married Frank G. Smart in 1921. They had a daughter, Waneta, and later divorced. She and her daughter moved to Los Angeles together in the 1930s. In 1946, Smart spent 30 days in jail after she was convicted of striking Waneta's husband, actor Victor Heyden, with a telephone. She was also prohibited from uninvited visits with Waneta or her husband for two years. She died in 1981, at the age of 87, in Los Angeles. \nThere is a folder of papers related to Smart in the library of the University of Nevada, Reno. Her work is included in Changing is not Vanishing: A Collection of American Indian Poetry to 1930 (2011).\nReferences\n^ a b Correspondence between F. H. Abbott to Garry P.

    "\nEl vampiro de la colonia Roma (English: The Vampire of Colonia Roma) is a novel by Mexican writer Luis Zapata Quiroz. Some critics consider it to be the definitive work of LGBT literature in Mexico. Its publication inspired a change in direction regarding the scorn and silence around homosexuality in literature. Since El vampire de la colonia Roma was published, other authors have taken on the subject of homosexuality without hesitation. The novel was published in 1979 after winning the Juan Grijalbo Prize.\nPlot\nAdonis Garc\u00eda is the nickname for a gay male prostitute in Mexico City. The book tells the story of his life though fictional interviews with a writer who records his extremely long monologue on magnetic tape. Garc\u00eda talks about his first memories through 25 years of his life, when the recording ends.\nGenre and impact\nEl vampire de la colonia Roma is a picaresque novel with an erotic theme. It is written in the form of a monologue beginning with recordings on magnetic tape that Luis Zapata obtained from an interview with Osiris P\u00e9rez. According to Le\u00f3n Guillermo Guti\u00e9rrez, it shed light on:\nThe hypocrisy of Mexican society, in which a lot of effort had been taken to hide in the corner of the closet: the practical, everyday life of homosexuality in all social spheres. Zapata does not settle for coming out of the closet, he takes it and travels by foot, car, bus, or motorcycle through the streets, avenues, parks, restaurants, and movie theaters of the big city and other latitudes of the country\u2019s geography.\nIts publication provoked a national, and even international, scandal over its homosexual content. The scandal in Mexico, according to Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Blanco, responded \"to the sanctimoniousness that thrives in the government, in the press, in some businesses, in the academy, and luckily it did not find its echo.\" Some prestigious writers, like Juan Rulfo and Sergio Maga\u00f1a, attacked the book without having read it, going as far as to recommend selling the book in plastic bags to prevent people from leafing through what was considered a \"pornographic\" text. Today, El vampire de la colonia Roma is considered a classic work in gay Mexican and Latin American literature.\nCommemorating thirty years since publication\nIn 2009, to celebrate 30 years since the book's initial publication, various commemorative festivities were held in Mexico City: at the XXX International Book Fair (Feria Internacional del Libro in the Palacio de Miner\u00eda, at the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and at the Palacio de Bellas Artes.\nTranslations\nIn the United States, a translation was published under the title Adonis Garc\u00eda, A Picaresque Novel in 1981 and it received favorable critiques given that\u2014as noted by the author, Luis Zapata, himself\u2014the U.S. did not have the same prejudices nor Mexico's macho tradition. In the United Kingdom, however, the work was confiscated by authorities for being \"indecent, pornographic, and obscene.\"\nBibliography\nHernandez-Rodriguez, R. \u201cThe Dark Night of Mexico: Picaresque, Sexuality, and Violence in El vampiro de la colonia Roma and Las p\u00faberes can\u00e9foras\u201d in Growing Up in Latin America.

It was built in 1930 by the contractors Jos\u00e9 Zea, Albadelajo and Mart\u00ednez Rosas, SA, with decoration by Vicente Maeso and carpentry by Adolfo Hern\u00e1ndez according to a design by the architect Enrique Nieto dated December 1929 and inaugurated on October 31, 1930, two thousand five hundred spectators, on April 14, 1931, the beginning of its sound film sessions took place with the German film titled in Spanish S\u00f3lo te he querido a ti, being declared a new work that year and expanded between 1934 and 1935 with proscenium and dressing rooms by the same architect in November 1934, to serve as a theater, the only one in the center of Melilla\nIt was renamed Cine Nacional in 1937 and suffered the loss of the original decoration of the room in 1952 and 1953, replaced by one by Pedro Aroca, of the pinnacles of the main fa\u00e7ade after several earthquakes between 1958 and 1959 and the elimination of the boxes of the progenium in 1969 to enlarge the screen.\nAfter the closure in 1982 of the Monumental Cinema Sport it became the largest cinema in Melilla, where the Melilla Film Weeks were held.\nIt was bought in 2005 and rebuilt between 2010 and 2011 by the Autonomous City of Melilla, being called Teatro Kursaal.\nDescription\nIt is built with masonry walls of local stone and brick, with brick vaults for the ceilings, very humble materials.\nExterior\nThe main fa\u00e7ade has a street that begins with three entrance doors with flat arches, continuing with a triple window that leads to a continuous balcony with a baluster. This window continues with another similar one, with a segmental arch above the cast iron sign, framed by a cornice adapted to the arch that leads to five lintelled windows, separated by pilasters that lead to a curved pediment, flanked by pinnacles that start in beautiful pillars decorated with geometric motifs that begin in the first body. The side streets have beautiful wooden doors, with mouldings that lead to a large window finished in an arch, Sevillian iron letters that lead to another cornice adapted to the arch and this to a window, topped with another curved pediment and flanked by the entire street with pilasters, repeating this composition of the street in the panels of the side fa\u00e7ade.\nInterior\nBefore the transformation it had three floors -800 and 400 seats-.\nThe ground floor had the ticket offices on the sides of the hall, behind which there is the patio, with a proscenium and orchestra at its end. The first floor had a foyer, the services and, separated by central railings, the <<eye of the patio>> that will offer the view of the hall on the ground floor, until the construction of the stage with the cabin and side entrances to the amphitheater that had the boxes in its outer arms. The second amphitheater, with the same layout, will house the accounting office and will end, in its central area, the view of the lower foyer.\nReferences\nCitations\n^ Aranda, Salvador Gallego. \"Enrique Nieto.

    "\nThe Battle of Archesh was a battle between the Byzantine and Sasanian armies during the Byzantine-Sasanian War of 602-628. The battle was the final event of Heraclius campaign of 624-625, after which the Byzantine army went on the offensive deep into the territory of the Sasanian Empire.\nBackground\nDuring the Heraclius campaign of 624-625, after the defeat of the united Persian army of Shahin, Shahrvaraz and Shahraplakan, Heraclius moved to Persia, but Shahin and Shahrvaraz gathered the remnants of the surviving army, united and decided to give battle to Heraclius again. Having received information that that the Lazi and Abasgi broke the alliance with the Romans and went home, the Persians decided to attack the army of Heraclius. After a while, the armies met and stood opposite each other until the evening, without taking any action.When evening came, the Byzantine emperor continued on his way, and the Sassanids followed him,they wanted to shorten the path, but ended up in a swampy area, thanks to which Heraclius entered Persarmenia, local residents learned about this and joined Shahrvaraz's army. With the onset of winter, the people scattered throughout their lands, which Heraclius took advantage of in the future.\nBattle\nHeraclius started the battle at night.He divided his army and headed towards the settlement of Salbanon.There he killed almost the entire Persian army, and Shahrvaraz, leaving all his equipment, mounted a horse and fled.They took the\narms of Shahrvaraz, namely his golden shield, his dagger, spear, gold belt set with\nprecious stones, and boots. When Heraclius had taken these things, he moved against\nthe men scattered in the villages. These men, on learning of the flight of Shahrvaraz,\nalso fled without restraint. He pursued them, killed or captured many of them,\nwhilst the remainder returned to Persia in disgrace.As for the emperor, he joyfully\ncollected his army and wintered in those parts.\nAftermath\nAfter this battle, Heraclius and his army moved deep into the Sasanian empire, beginning the final stage of this war.\nReferences\n^ Maurikios, Strategikon 11.

    "Historic property in London\n1821 image of the house.\nBrandenburgh House was a historic country house on the River Thames in Hammersmith, then in Middlesex some way beyond the outskirts of London. While it had a number of owners it is best known for the brief residence of  Caroline of Brunswick in the early 1820s. It is sometimes spelt as Brandenburg House.\nEarly history\nDating back to the reign of Charles I when it was built for Nicholas Crispe, the house gained its best-known name as the residence of Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and his English wife Elizabeth Craven there from 1792. \nDuring her time there it became known for staging  amateur theatrics.\nOther earlier residents included Prince Rupert and George Doddington.\nQueen Caroline\nIt gained its greatest attention in 1820 to 1821 when Caroline of Brunswick, the estranged wife of George IV, lived there following her return to Britain after six years abroad. When her husband then tried to divorce her on Parliament it became a centre of pilgrimage for the Queen's supporters. A large delegation of London waterman came on 8 October 1820 to pay their respects.\nAlthough the government presented evidence of her adultery with her Italian lover Bartolomeo Pergarmi, the attempt to divorce her collapsed in the House of Lords. Caroline died in the house on 7 August just a week after the coronation of her husband to which she had been refused admission. Her body was conveyed back to her native Brunswick from Brandenburgh House. Although her husband insisted on a journey entirely by ship, practical difficulties meant it had to be taken by land at first. The procession was hijacked by the radical populace and taken through the City of London, the heart of her popular support.\nLegacy\nThe house was subsequently demolished. its historical legacy lives on in the name of the Caroline Estate, a housing estate a little to the north of the old house near Hammersmith Bridge. Today the site of the former Brandenburg House is located in Fulham Reach. A road running from Hammersmith station to the Riverside Studios is called Queen Caroline Street.\nReferences\n^ O'Loughlin p.91\n^ Gasper p.195\n^ Mitton p.26\n^ Fraster p.577-79\n^ Gash p.178\n^ O'Loughlin p.91\nBibliography\nFraser, Flora.

The company also produces juices, vinegar and other products under brand GADERIA.\nThe company's products are sold in Ukraine and exported to Middle East, European Union, United Kingdom and other countries.\nThe founder and owner of the company is an entrepreneur from Lviv \u2014 Mykhailo Kupranets.\nHistory\nThe first orchard was laid out in 1996 on a 10-hectare plot of land in the Lviv region of Ukraine. It was started as a farm, which was to become a family business growing apples. In 2012, the company Lvivskyi Sad LLC was founded on its basis, functioning as a local apple producer for the local population and supplying the surrounding district until 2017. In 2017, in order to expand the enterprise, the company secured a loan of approximately 1 million euros from an external investor to increase the orchard area to 60 hectares of various apple varieties using intensive cultivation technology. Between 2017 and 2019, a storage facility using modern refrigeration technology was constructed, capable of storing 2,000 tons of produce year-round. Additionally, a state-of-the-art apple sorting line from the French manufacturer Maf Roda was launched.\nAfter repaying the borrowed funds, the orchard became a family business in 2022, transitioning to management under a closed investment fund owned by the Kupranets family: Mykhailo, his wife and son. In 2018, along with growing and processing apples, the family foundation decided to develop a new business area - blueberry growing. To this end, Grona Agro LLC was established on 50 hectares of land in the north of Kyiv region, specialising in blueberry cultivation. Over seven years, the company achieved an annual planned yield of 50 tons of blueberries. The family fund owns a 65% stake in this company.\nIn 2023, the company put into operation a line for the production of natural direct-pressed juices from the Austrian manufacturer Voran under the Gaderia brand  with the production capacity of the line is 100,000 litres per month. Gaderia juices have taken a leading position in the eco-products segment in Ukraine, and are also exported to the United Kingdom, Austria, the Baltic States, etc. on a regular basis.\nFrom 2022 to 2024, Lvivskyi Sad took an active part in the state programme to support medium-sized agricultural businesses, thanks to which the orchard area was increased by 12 hectares of intensive orchard planting of the Gala apple variety, popular in the Middle East. The state of Ukraine compensated 50% of the orchard establishment costs within the framework of the national programme.\nReferences\n^ a b Khomchenko, Mykhailo (1 May 2022). \"\u0422\u041e\u0412 \"\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0434\" \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043d\u0430 12 \u0433\u0430\".

    "Period in Jewish history, c. 70 CE\u2013638 CE\nMenorah in the Cave of the Sarcophagi, from the Beit She'arim necropolis\nThe Rabbinic period, or the Talmudic period, denotes a transformative era in Jewish history, spanning from the destruction of the Second Temple in 70\u00a0CE to the Muslim conquest in 638\u00a0CE.\nAfter the failure of the Great Jewish Revolt of 66\u201373\u00a0CE, Roman measures such as the Fiscus Judaicus tax and land confiscation severely impacted the Jewish population of Judaea. The destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple required Jewish culture to adapt in order to survive. Judaism endured through the establishment of new centers of scholarship and leadership, initially at Yavne under Yohanan ben Zakkai, who promoted a focus on Torah study and synagogue worship. The next decades also saw the Jewish response to several catastrophic events, including the failed Diaspora uprisings of 115\u2013117\u00a0CE and the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132\u2013135\u00a0CE, a failed bid for the reestablishment of an independent Jewish state in Judaea. The suppression of these revolts by the Romans led to the devastation of Judea proper as well as diaspora communities, the death and enslavement of many Jews, further displacement, and economic hardship. Despite these challenges, Jewish communal life continued to thrive, particularly in the Galilee, which became a major center of Jewish life and scholarship. The authority of the Patriarchs was instrumental in maintaining Jewish continuity during this transformative period.\nDuring the later Rabbinic period, the Jewish population in the Land of Israel continued to decline under Christianized Roman rule. Jews started facing discriminatory laws and religious persecution, and many emigrated to flourishing Diaspora communities. From the 3rd century onward, the Jewish community in Babylonia became a central hub of Jewish life, benefiting from a relatively tolerant environment under the Sasanian Empire. This period of economic prosperity and political freedom allowed the Babylonian Jewish community, led by the Exilarch, to thrive and foster significant theological and literary developments. During the Rabbinic period, Jewish communities were also present in various regions of the Mediterranean, including Egypt, North Africa, Asia Minor, Italy, and Spain.\nThe rabbinic period was foundational in the ongoing development of Judaism and its traditions. During this time, the Jewish religious practice transitioned from a focus on the Temple and sacrificial practices to a greater emphasis on Halakha (Jewish law) and Aggadah (biblical interpretation). This period saw the creation of major texts of rabbinic literature, such as the Mishnah, Tosefta, Jerusalem Talmud, Babylonian Talmud, and various midrashim (biblical commentaries). Jews maintained their cultural and religious identity by continuing to speak and write in Hebrew and Aramaic, and developed liturgy, including piyyutim (liturgical poetry). They set up synagogues and yeshivas, engaged in mysticism, and hoped for the Messiah to bring their exile to an end.\nHistory\nAftermath of the destruction\nFurther information: First Jewish\u2013Roman War \u00a7\u00a0Aftermath\nThe First Jewish\u2013Roman War took a heavy toll on the Jewish people in the Land of Israel. Approximately one quarter of the Jewish population in Judaea was killed in the fighting and its aftermath and about one tenth was taken into captivity. The Temple, as a national and administrative center of Jewish life and worship was demolished, Jerusalem was destroyed, and the autonomous positions of the Sanhedrin and the High-priesthood were rendered null and void. The social structure prior to the destruction collapsed and the factions of the Sadducees and the Essenes disappeared. On the other hand, the status of the Jews as a people recognized as a nation in the Roman Empire remained, as did their freedom to follow their faith and religious law. Vespasian placed an additional tax of two Dinar for each Jew, the Fiscus Judaicus, creating a financial burden on Jews and meant to humiliate Jews. The Romans also confiscated land from Jews.\nNew beginnings\nAround the period of the destruction of the Temple, Yohanan ben Zakkai moved from Jerusalem to Yavneh, a small town on the coast, where he established a new center of leadership. The Rabbinic movement adopted and further developed the Pharisee approach to Halakha.\nThis new movement put an emphasis on Torah study, and prayer and the Synagogue emerged as the center of community life. At this stage, the center of Jewish leadership was still in the Land of Israel, although it would eventually move to Babylonia.\nAlthough Yohanan ben Zakkai made certain decrees \"to remember the Temple\", his general approach was to continue observing Judaism regardless of the Temple or lack thereof.\nWithin the Jewish community, prestige and authority was given to the nasi (patriarch).  But this authority was challenged by rabbis several times until Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi consolidated his authority as both the p",
    "Former lifeboat station on the Isle of Wight, UK\nAtherfield Lifeboat Station was located at Atherfield Point, near the village of Atherfield, on the south west coast of the Isle of Wight.\nA lifeboat was first placed here in 1890 by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).\nAtherfield Lifeboat Station was closed in 1915.\nHistory\nFollowing the formation of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS) in 1824, (later to become the RNLI in 1854), acts of gallantry may be rewarded by the award of RNIPLS Gold and Silver Medals, even if no lifeboat was involved. No less than 17 medals were awarded for service around the Atherfield coast, between 1832 and 1857.\nIn the early hours of 14 January 1843, in a strong gale, the brig George was wrecked at Atherfield whilst on passage from South Shields to Grenada. At daybreak, Lieutenants John Bulley and William Vicary of H.M. Coastguard, and their men, fired rocket lines to the vessel. Unsuccessful at first, they eventually managed to recover one of the crew, who informed them that the Master and Mate had been washed overboard, but 10 men were still aboard. Bulley and Vicary then took command of two small fishing boats, with a crew of coastguard and local fishermen, and in poor conditions, rescued the 10 men, moments before the vessel broke up. Bulley and Vicary were awarded the RNIPLS Gold Medal, with the other nine rescuers each awarded the RNIPLS Silver Medal.\nTwo lifeboats had been placed further north along the coast at Brook and Brighstone Grange in 1860, but it was only in 1890 that a third boat was provided for Atherfield. She was a 31-foot Self-righting 'pulling and sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with oars and sails, and was built by Waterman Brothers, at a cost of \u00a3252. The boat was transported by rail free of charge from London to Portsmouth by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company, where it was collected by the crew, and sailed to the Atherfield station.\nA corrugated-iron boathouse was constructed on the top of the cliffs at Atherfield - about 76 feet (23\u00a0m) in height - and the boat would be launched down a 240 foot (73\u00a0m) long , steep 1-in-3 path, down to the shore, over skids or railway sleepers. A winch was installed to haul the lifeboat back up the cliff. Placed on service on 27 October 1890, the boat, funded from the bequest of the late Mrs Swift of Kensington, was named Catherine Swift (ON 278). There were no less than seven brothers on the crew, including Coxswain William Cotton, and Second Coxswain David Cotton, both recipients of the RNLI Silver Medal, for their service on the Brighstone Grange lifeboat Worcester Cadet (ON 226), to the full-rigged ship Sirenia on 9 March 1888.\nAt 10:00pm on Sunday, 31 January 1892, the Atlantic steamship Eider of the Norddeutscher Lloyd company, on passage from New York to Bremen, ran aground on the Atherfield Ledge in thick fog, having missed sighting the Needles Lighthouse. She was carrying 163 crew, 227 passengers, 500 sacks of mail, and \u00a3300,000 worth of gold specie and silver ingots. The Atherfield lifeboat Catherine Swift was the first to arrive to her aid, but in the hope of being refloated, Capt. Heineke declined assistance. Tugs arrived, but failed to free the vessel.\nOn the Monday morning, in worsening weather, lifeboats from Brighstone Grange and Atherfield attended the vessel, along with the lifeboat from Brook after five hours hard rowing. In batches of 13 or 14 people at a time, the three lifeboats returned all the passengers to shore. The crew, and most of the mail, were recovered on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the lifeboat crews recovered the remainder of the mail, and with the permission from the RNLI, the gold and silver, which was then handed to the charge of the armed coastguard. The lifeboatmen received a monetary reward for each silver ingot, or box of gold bullion recovered. Visitors to the scene were Prince Henry of Battenberg, Governor of the Isle of Wight, and on the friday, both the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and Prince George (later King George V), who would personally convey the thanks of Her Majesty Queen Victoria to the three coxswains. All three coxswains were awarded the RNLI Silver Medal, along with an inscribed gold watch, presented by His Imperial Majesty Wilhelm II, Emperor of Germany.\nFor reasons unknown, the Catherine Swift (ON 278) would only serve for 2 years at Atherfield. After 1992, she was withdrawn, and subsequently only used for demonstration purposes. A fractionally larger boat was constructed by regular lifeboat builders Woolfe and Sons of Shadwell, arriving on the 29 December 1892. This boat would also carry the name Catherine Swift (ON 354).\nIn 3 December 1906, the lifeboat was replaced once again, this time with a 35-foot Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, built by Thames Ironworks. Funded by Mrs G. W. Moss of Liverpool. the boat was named Gem (ON 568), and would serve for nine years.\nIn 1915, the Atherfiel",
    "British forest and mammalogist\nDonovan Reginald Rosevear (born 28 November 1900 in Chelsea and died 17 January 1986) was a British forester and mammalogist.\nBiography\nAfter completing his education at Bedford, Rosevear graduated in 1923 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Diploma in Forestry from Christ's College, University of Cambridge. In 1924 he moved to Nigeria, where he joined the Colonial Forest Service. For the first 20 years of his career, Rosevear worked in the south-eastern provinces of Nigeria and the British Cameroons. In addition to his profession, Rosevear was a keen observer of nature, studying the fauna and flora of West Africa.\nRosevear was an active supporter of the Nigerian Field Society (NFS), founded in 1930 by Frank Bridges. He published numerous articles in The Nigerian Field, the journal of the Nigerian Field Society, and served as vice-president of the society from 1947 to 1976.\nIn 1944 Rosevear settled in Ibadan and in 1951 he became Inspector-General of Forests in Lagos. In 1954 he left active forest service and returned to Britain. In London he became a volunteer at the Natural History Museum, where he worked for over 20 years with the support of the Wellcome Trust and the Leverhulme Trust.\nFrom 1956 to 1960 he was a member of the committee of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society.\nRosevear assembled a large collection of small West African mammals and published a series of scientific works on mammals, including \"Forest Conditions of the Gambia\" (1937), \"Hoofed Mammals of Nigeria\" (1939), A Checklist and Atlas of Nigerian Mammals (1953), The Bats of West Africa (1965), The Rodents of West Africa (1969), and The Carnivores of West Africa (1974).\nHonors\nIn 1954, Rosevear was appointed Commander of the British Empire (CBE). In 1971, he received the Stamford Raffles Award from the Zoological Society of London. In 1978, he was awarded the H. H. Bloomer Award from the Linnean Society of London. In 1980, the Rosevear's striped grass mouse (Lemniscomys roseveari), native to Zambia, in 1997, the Rosevear's brush-furred mouse (Lophuromys roseveari), native to Cameroon, and in 2013, Rosevear's serotine (Neoromicia roseveari), native to Liberia and Guinea, were named in Donovan Rosevear's honour.\nReferences\n^ a b https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/0572a37b-5d8f-4b31-bc83-cf2b348b4de0\n^ a b c Hill, J.

    "Signing of U18 players in US women's soccer league\nThe Under-18 Entry Mechanism sets the rules for how soccer players below the age of 18 may sign professional contracts in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), the top division of women's soccer in the United States.\nBackground\nThe NWSL had a minimum age requirement of 18 until 2021, when 15-year-old Olivia Moultrie filed an antitrust lawsuit against the league. She reached an settlement that allowed her to sign with Portland Thorns FC after going through a league discovery process that involved her rights being acquired by OL Reign and traded to the Thorns. The following year, the NWSL allowed 17-year-old Jaedyn Shaw to sign with San Diego Wave FC through discovery, with five other teams submitting bids for her rights including the Washington Spirit which she had trained with for months. Other sports leagues in the United States continue to have minimum requirements, such as 18 in the National Hockey League and Major League Baseball. Major League Soccer allows younger players to sign contracts which occurs mostly for development purposes.\nThe NWSL introduced the Under-18 Entry Mechanism on November 14, 2022, establishing a formal process for signing players under the age of 18. As of 2024, the NWSL allows teams to have up to four under-18 players between their private entry list and roster. Players must be signed within a month of being named to the entry list, and their contracts must last through the season in which they turn 18. Until coming of age, under-18 players may not be cut from their team's roster nor traded (unless the player and her parent or guardian consents) nor selected in an expansion draft. In addition to contractual protections, under-18 players are required to live with a parent or guardian and use separate showers and locker rooms.\nChloe Ricketts was the first player to sign through the Under-18 Entry Mechanism, joining the Washington Spirit on March 3, 2023, at the age of 15.\nList of signings\n\u00a0\u00a0Current youngest signing (\u2042)\n\u00a0\u00a0Former youngest signing (*)\nReferences\n^ a b c Maese, Rick; Brockway, Ella (June 7, 2024). \"As teens swarm women's soccer, 'we have to be really careful'\".

    "\nSelf-governing District of Brno in South Moravian Region, Czech Republic\nBrno-sever (lit. 'Brno-North') is one of the 29 self-governing districts of Brno, Czech Republic, located in the north side of the city. It is made up of the districts and cadastral areas of Husovice, Lesn\u00e1 and Sob\u011b\u0161ice and parts of \u010cern\u00e1 Pole and Z\u00e1brdovice. The total cadastral area amounts to 12.24 km\u00b2. The self-governing district was established on November 24, 1990, and its office is located in Z\u00e1brdovice.\nFor the purposes of the senate elections, the territory of the Brno-sever district is included in electoral district number 60 of the Brno-City District.\nHistory\nUrban development\nThe oldest parts of Brno-sever are the former villages of Husovice, Sob\u011b\u0161ice and Z\u00e1brdovice, whose development dates back to the Middle Ages. The suburban villa and residential development of \u010cern\u00e1 Pole was created only during the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as the \"New Husovice\" around the Republic Square. In the interwar period, workers' quarters also grew up here, both planned (e.g. semi-detached houses on M\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 street according to the project of Bohuslav Fuchs) and emergency ones (Divi\u0161ova \u010dtvr\u0165, P\u00edse\u010dn\u00edk). An important change was the construction of the new \"Ti\u0161novka\" in the early 1950s and the subsequent cancellation of the original line that separated Husovice from Z\u00e1brdovice and \u010cern\u00fd Pol\u00ed.\nOverall, the youngest district of Brno-sever is Lesn\u00e1, whose panel development was created in the 1960s and 1970s. years of the 20th century. Around the same time (1960s-1980s), panel houses also grew up in \u010cern\u00e1 Pole. Panel housing did not appear in the other districts of the modern city district. In the 1980s, Brno's large urban ring road was cut through the original Husovice semi-detached house (Tomek Square) as a significant urban intervention. In the years 1996\u20131998, the Husovice tunnel was built as part of the circuit on the territory of the city district, thanks to which the traffic in \u010cern\u00e1 Pole on Provazn\u00edkova and Merhautova streets was relieved. As a follow-up to this tunnel, a major reconstruction of the intersection at Tomek Square into a level crossing is underway from 2021, in connection with which some other remnants of the old development were disposed of.\nAdministrative development\nFrom a historical point of view, the territory of the modern city district of Brno-sever includes the entire cadastre of the former city of Husovice and the former municipality of Sob\u011b\u0161ice, parts of the original cadastres of Kr\u00e1lovo Pole, Z\u00e1brdovice, Doln\u00ed a Horn\u00ed Cejl, Ob\u0159any and a small part of the original cadastres of Velk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ulice and \u010cerven\u00e1. The territory of the modern Brno-sever district was divided into these cadastral territories until the second cadastral reform from the second half of the 1960s, while the boundaries of these units were modified several times throughout history.\nThe territory of the Brno-sever district was gradually annexed to Brno in several stages: on July 6, 1850, Doln\u00ed and Horn\u00ed Cejl, Velk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ulice and Z\u00e1brdovice were annexed; On October 23, 1912, some lands originally belonging to Kr\u00e1lovo Pole; On April 16, 1919, Husovice, Ob\u0159any and the rest of the area of Kr\u00e1lovo Pole were annexed; On November 26, 1971, Sob\u011b\u0161ice was the last to be annexed to Brno.\nThe modern district of Brno-sever was established on November 24, 1990, on most of the territory of the former Brno III municipal district, from which several districts were separated when it was abolished, the residents of which expressed dissatisfaction with the existing membership of this district and its functioning after the Velvet Revolution (for example, Malom\u011b\u0159ice and Ob\u0159any that created their own district). On May 1, 1998, the Brno-sever district was additionally expanded by the addition of part of the Z\u00e1brdovice cadastral territory based on an agreement with the neighboring Brno-st\u0159ed district.\nThe incoherence and compactness of the city district (extraordinary in the Brno context) sometimes led to tendencies to break away from a district (e.g. in 2014 in Lesn\u00e1), but these views have never received sufficient support.\nCharacter\nThe urban part of Brno-sever is located on the edge of the Brno basin, from its lower part of the territory it rises over the Lesn\u00e1 terrace to the forested upland plains in the Sob\u011b\u0161ice cadastral area. The urban part has a very uneven structure and, as a result of its demarcation, a rather atypical shape resembling an hourglass. With the exception of Sob\u011b\u0161ice, which has the character of a large village surrounded by a forest, the rest of the township has a distinctly urban character with various types of development (large-city apartment blocks, terraced family houses, villa development, panel housing estates). The district office is located on the very southern edge of the territory, in the cadastral area of Z\u00e1brdovice.\nOn the territory of Brno-sever there are, for example, the buildings of the Mendel University in Brno, the regional Trade",
    "The 2024\u201325 Southern Football League season is the 122nd in the history of the Southern League since its establishment in 1894. The league has two Premier divisions (Central and South) at Step 3 of the National League System (NLS) and two Division One divisions (Central and South) at Step 4. These correspond to levels 7 and 8 of the English football league system. \nThe allocations for Steps 3 and 4 this season were announced by The Football Association (FA) on 17 May 2024.

However, Coalville Town, who were due to have competed in the Premier Division Central, subsequently resigned from the Southern League; their place was filled by Hitchin Town who were reprieved from relegation to Division One Central leaving an unfilled vacancy in that division, which therefore comprised 21 teams instead of 22.\nPremier Division Central\nFootball league season\nPremier Division Central comprises 22 teams, 15 of which competed in the previous season.\nTeam changes\nPremier Division Central table\nUpdated to match(es) played on 26 August 2024.

    "\nAIVF is Tel Aviv-based healthtech startup focused on revolutionizing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) through the application of artificial intelligence (AI). The main company's product is EMA software platform.\nHistory\nAIVF was founded in 2018 in Tel Aviv, Israel, by Daniella Gilboa, a clinical embryologist, and Prof. Daniel Seidman, a reproductive endocrinologist and IVF expert. AIVF aims to improve the success rates of IVF treatments and shorten the time to pregnancy.\nIn 2019, the company secured financial support from angel investors, venture capital firms, and grants from the Israel Innovation Authority and the European R&D program Eureka.\nIn 2021, AIVF's EMA software received the CE Mark, indicating compliance with European health, safety, and environmental protection standards. The company is also GDPR and HIPAA-compliant, ensuring the privacy and security of patient data.\nIn June 2022, AIVF raised $25 million in Series A financing led by Insight Partners, with participation from Adam Neumann's Family Office.\nTechnology\nAIVF's product is the EMA platform, an AI-powered system that evaluates the viability of embryos during IVF procedures. EMA analyzes biological data from embryos from Day Zero (fertilization) to Day 5 or Day 6, scoring them based on their probability of successful implantation and pregnancy. This technology aims to standardize the embryo evaluation process across clinics, reducing human subjectivity and improving IVF success rates.\nAIVF's EMA platform improved IVF success rates, reducing failed pregnancies and increasing accuracy in embryo selection. The company reports that EMA provides a 38% higher accuracy level compared to evaluations by embryologists alone, with embryos scoring high on EMA demonstrating a 70% probability of successful pregnancy.  The use of EMA has been shown to reduce the number of IVF cycles needed to achieve a fetal heartbeat by over 27.5%.\nIn 2024, AIVF unveiled the first AI-based embryo evaluation for euploidy screening test based on time-lapse videos. This instant non-invasive AI tool successfully refines the genetic quality assessment of embryos in IVF clinics.\nAIVF's EMA platform is commercially available across Europe, Australia, Brazil, South Korea and North America.  In 2023, the company announced its preparations to launch its platform in the United States.\nReferences\n^ Ghert-Zand, Renee (2022-05-16). \"Women entrepreneurs are leading the charge to make Israel a femtech powerhouse\".

    "Polish malariologist and medical entomologist\nLeonard Jan Bruce-Chwatt (born Leonard Jan Chwatt on 9 June 1907 in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and died 18 May 1989) was a Polish medical doctor, malariologist and medical entomologist who worked extensively on malarial research in Nigeria with the British colonial medical service, and later with the World Health Organization and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nBiography and career\nBruce-Chwatt was educated first in Saint Petersburg, and later in Warsaw where he obtained his degree in medicine with distinction in 1930. He spent two years as RMO in the Polish Army. He then took a postgraduate degree in microbiology and serology in 1933, after which he moved to France for two years to pursue a diploma in colonial medicine. He worked at the Pasteur Institute and the H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis until the outbreak of the Second World War when he joined the Polish Army Medical Corps. He later escaped to England where he joined the Polish Rifle Brigade. While serving with the Polish Army in Britain, Bruce-Chwatt earned a Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and the Duncan Medal at the LSHTM.\nIn 1942, he was transferred to the Royal Army Medical Corps and sent to No. 7 Malaria Field Laboratory in Nigeria. He was demobilized in 1946, and began working as a medical entomologist with the Colonial Medical Service in Nigeria. In 1948, Chwatt became a British subject, married Joan Margaret Bruce and added her name to his own. In 1948, he was assigned to the Rockefeller Yellow Fever Research Institute in Lagos. From 1949 to 1958, as Senior Specialist (Malariologist), he organised and managed Nigeria's Federal Malaria Service.\nIn 1958 Bruce-Chwatt became Chief of Research and Technical Intelligence in the Malaria Eradication Division of the World Health Organization in Geneva, where he remained for the next 10 years. In 1968, he joined the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as Professor of Tropical Hygiene, becoming Director of its Ross Institute the following year. Upon his retirement in 1974 he joined the Wellcome Museum of Medical Science and, in 1985, the Wellcome Tropical Institute. It was during this period that he was able to indulge his long-standing interest in the history of malaria. Over the course of his career, Bruce-Chwatt published numerous works on malaria.\nHonours\nBruce-Chwatt received the Officer of the British Empire during the 1953 Coronation Honours, and the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George during the 1976 Birthday Honours. In 1971, Bruce-Chwatt was conferred with the Darling Foundation Prize awarded by League of Nations. He also received the George Macdonald Medal awarded by the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and LSHTM IN 1981.\nSelected publications\nBruce-Chwatt, Leonard Jan (1985).

    "\nThe coat of arms of Cusco is the official coat of arms of the city of Cusco, Peru, and is also used by the region, the province, and the district with the same name. Its current version was approved by the Provincial Council of Cusco in a solemn session on July 23, 1986.\nCoat of arms\nCoat of arms of 1540: In a field of gules (red), a silver castle on the fortress of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n; a gold border charged with eight (3,2,2,1) black condors, and topped with a Spanish helmet\nThe historian and university professor from Cusco, David Vicente de Rojas Silva, cited by Angles Vargas, shows that Guam\u00e1n Poma de Ayala included in his chronicle two drawings corresponding to the first and second coats of arms of Cusco during the Incan Empire. Both are quartered Iberian-style shields corresponding to two successive dynasties, the first with divine evocations and the second with royal attributes. The first shield contains a sun, a moon, a star, and the idol of Wanakaure on Paqarejtampo. The second contains the Qori-q'enque bird, a jaguar, a mascaypacha, and a double serpent.\nRojas Silva indicates that the dean Diego de Esquivel y Navia stated in his \"Annals\" that the city of Cusco received from Carlos I of Spain the monarch's own arms as King of Spain, which were displayed until 1540. These arms were illustrated on a banner located at the head of the council hall of the Palace of the Cabildo until 1824 when it was donated to Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar during his visit to Cusco. The military leader sent the banner to Caracas, where it is preserved in the Historical Museum of that city. In 1534, thanks to a donation made by the city to the king to finance the war in Flanders, Carlos I granted two heraldic eagles to be included in the city's shield. These eagles, along with the fact that the city used the emperor's arms, supported the appellation of the city as the Imperial City.\nOn July 19, 1540, King Carlos I of Spain issued a Royal Decree qualifying Cusco as the \"Most illustrious, most noble, loyal, and faithful city of Cusco, the most important and head of the kingdoms of Peru,\" adding the grant of a coat of arms:\nIn Madrid, on the 19th day of July in the year 1540, a Privilege of Arms was dispatched to the city of Cuzco in which a shield was granted, inside of which is a castle of gold on a red field, in memory of the fact that said city and its castle were conquered by force of arms in our service; and a border of eight condors, which are large birds resembling vultures found in the province of Peru, in memory of the fact that at the time the said city was conquered, these birds descended to feed on the dead who died there, which are on a gold field.- Signed by the Cardinal of Seville.- Countersigned by S\u00e1mano.- Signed by Dr. Beltr\u00e1n.\nThese arms were later ratified by Philip II of Spain according to the decree of May 5, 1593, and also by Carlos II on January 17, 1661, and by Carlos III in 1788.\nVariations of the shield\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the city's granted coat of arms underwent variations, the most notable being the change of the castle to a tower. The reasons for this change are varied, ranging from similar coats of arms granted to local residents to the intention of recreating Inca towers like those that existed in Sacsayhuam\u00e1n or in the Huacaypata. Another common variation was the removal of the border of condors, though the reasons for this change are not well-known.\nCurrent coat of arms of Cusco\nMain article: Sol de Echenique\nSide door of the Palace of the Cabildo displaying the new coat of arms.\nIn a solemn session on June 23, 1986, the Provincial Council of Cusco signed Municipal Agreement No. 063 A/MC-SG-86 along with the Mayor of Cusco, Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, which decided to establish the disk known as the Sol de Echenique as the official coat of arms of Cusco. Furthermore, it banned \"all heraldic representations imposed by the conquest as the Coat of Arms of Cusco.\" This municipal agreement was published in the official newspaper El Peruano on July 2, 1986. Various historians have questioned the choice of the Sol de Echenique as the emblem of Cusco. As summarized by Cusque\u00f1o anthropologist Jorge Flores Ochoa in 1997, the plaque \"is not Inca, it is not a sun... neither is it from Cusco\".\nReferences\n^ a b Angles Vargas 1988, p.\u00a0157.\n^ a b Angles Vargas 1988, p.\u00a0133.\n^ a b Angles Vargas 1988, p.\u00a0139.\n^ Ramos G\u00f3mez 2004, p.\u00a0166.\n^ Angles Vargas 1988, p.\u00a0162.\n^ \"\u00bfEl Sol del Cuzco?\".

    "Indian journalist (1816-1847)\nBhaskar Pandurang Tarkhadkar (1816-1847) was an Indian journalist and an open critic of colonial British rule. He was the brother of Atmaram Pandurang and Dadoba Pandurang. He used the freedom of Press by Charles Metcalfe to write a series of eight letters called 'epistles' in the Bombay Gazette from July to October 1841. He wrote under the own name 'A Hindoo,' with his letters claiming that British Colonial Rule in India was \"the most bitter curse India has ever been visited with.\" His epistles earned him the title of 'Second Junius' after the 1771 'Letters of Junius' which did harsh criticism of British government.\nEarly life\nTarkhadkar was born in Bombay in 1816 in a renowned family of scholars. He was educated in Girgaum. He was initially enrolled in a Marathi-medium school, but later transferred to an English-medium one. His command over English language brought him liberal ideas of the Europeans. Later he studied at Elphinstone College where many other intellectuals like Dadabhai Naoroji studied in later years.\nCareer\nHe wrote scathing critique of British colonial rule in the Bombay Gazette under its pro-India editor Dr. George Buist, who later resigned due to British pressure. One of his epistles was in response to the news of First Opium War. He asked the British: \"Where is your integrity and good sense which you so much boast of- ugh! Self interest is all in all to you, and to secure it you would do anything.\"\nHe called the British officers \"a horde of foreign usurpers whose sole aim is to enrich themselves.\" The British boasted of Indian railways as an example of public welfare, but Tarkhadkar said that all railways and laws by British were in fact \"conveniences\" for themselves, while \"India was rendered everyday poorer and poorer.\"\nThus, this fearless writer highlighted the drain of wealth from India sixty years before Dadabhoi Naoroji's Poverty and Un-British Rule in India. He said that the British were responsible for \"draining India of its wealth and reducing it to poverty.\" He criticised the destruction of indigenous industries in Maharashtra and the one way duty free trade which allowed Britain to sell goods in Indian markets for cheap. Indian wealth of \"about 1000 million pounds\" were drained to Britain between the Battle of Plassey in 1757 to 1815, he wrote. He criticised the Afghanistan campaign of 1838 of East India Company when there was a famine and economic recession in India.\nHe compared the imperialism of Muslim rulers and British rulers. He praised Muslim rulers in India for keeping in mind the public welfare of people and not sending wealth to lands outside India, unlike the British who siphoned off Indian wealth to Britain. British did it \"at the sad expense of prosperity and happiness of the poor and inoffensive of inhabitants,\" he wrote. He attacked the haughty, racial arrogance of British rulers. \nHe attacked the destruction of Maratha Confideracy in 1818 through treachery, with \"divide and rule\" policy. He attacked the company rule by mocking the British Empire, \"so great an Empire of being given in monopoly to a body of voracious merchants.\"  He called the Board of Control of British East India Company as the \"court of Board of Submission,\" and the Board of Directors as \"the court of obeyers.\" He lambasted British parliament for their \"callously indifferent attitude towards Indian problems.\"  He called the British \"race of infernal demons.\" He wrote, \"Your hearts are as black as your skins are white and your souls are impure in proportion with the cleanliness of your outward appearance.\"\nHe also criticised James Mill's work History of British India as unscientific, prejudiced in the highest degree. He said Mill had never even visited India and the armchair historian has the perfidity to denegrate Indian people with his own fantasy. \nThe uproar was such that Buist had to submit resignation and censorship on press was brought in soon. Tarkhadkar 's writings form an essential part of India's fight against British colonialism, and his methods were carried forward by younger writers like Bal Gangadhar Tilak.\nReferences\n^ a b Ahir, Rajiv (2022).

    "\nDominican independence leader\nJuan Noues\u00ed Laffite was a Dominican revolutionary and independence hero. He was a famous leader during the turbulent struggles for Dominican independence.\nLife\nOrigins\nDistinguished and heroic commander of the national weapons, native of Marmolejos, rural section of the old common of Blanco, (today Luper\u00f3n). His father was called Juan Francisco Laffite and his mother, Mar\u00eda del Carmen Noues\u00edt. He preferably used the last maternal name, that people's speech and vulgar use modified it to convert it into Nouesi or Nouez\u00ed as used today by the his descendants.\nHe was an officer in the Dominican War of Independence. When the annexation was imposed by Pedro Santana and his henchmen, he served the new order in the position of Captain Ped\u00e1neo in his region. \nSanto Domingo War\nPrestigious, wealthy, recognized for his gift of leadership and courage. He was one of the first to join the Dominican Restoration War, with his troops made up of peasants recruited in the western area of Puerto Plata, called Los Rancheros, who gained fame for their inexhaustible resistance and unsurpassed courage, especially in knife actions. At the head of his Rancheros, and in tactical coordination with Gregorio de Lora and other commanders, he led the 169th attack on the Spanish in Puerto Plata on August 27, 1863. The Spanish received huge reinforcements from Cuba and Puerto Rico, thanks to which they maintained control of the city and, in a vigorous counterattack, pushed the patriots into the fields. The momentary dispersion came, but the will could be recovered fight, and Juan Noues\u00ed and his rancheros became invincible in their fields of origin.\nThe city of Puerto Plata remained in the hands of the oppressors, but under the siege of a belt of resistance against which the material power of the enemies was never able. In the days of the siege of Santiago, Noues\u00ed and his troops caused heavy casualties while blocking the passage of the reinforcements sent to that city from Puerto Plata. He was in Santiago, in full action, on September 6, 1863, the day that General Gaspar Polanco ordered the thorough attack on the San Luis Fortress, the last stronghold of the Spanish, and the city burned. Noues\u00ed immediately returned to his region, to combine actions with the forces of other leaders such as Francisco Reyes Mari\u00f3n, Pedro Gregorio Mart\u00ednez and Gregorio de Lora.\nThus, it became a more painful march in defeat of the Spanish from Santiago to Puerto Plata. Roads blocked with stones and trees, ditches opened in risky defiles, heavy fire and surprise attacks in the most difficult passes, furious assaults with knives at unexpected points, turned that Spanish retreat into one of the most exhausting episodes for the invaders. Disoriented, hindered in their march by entire families of Spanishized natives who marched with them, and by other families that the Spanish forcibly took as hostages. Added to all this was the problem represented by the wounded carried in litters. Those troops could not escape the surprise and confusion of seeing the myth of their alleged racial superiority defeated and their mistaken belief destroyed that, due to their material power, their professionalism and their experience in numerous wars of conquest, they could not in any way Some will be defeated, much less by poorly armed combatants, children of a people who, in the racial prejudice of the colonialists, were considered inferior.\nAn example of anguish that the action of the Dominicans condemned the invaders, offers it a passage that occurred to the advance guard that Juan Suero commanded in the retreat to Puerto Plata. The story goes that upon arriving at Llano de P\u00e9rez, Suero ordered to stop and take a breather in the apparent stillness of the country house and the bowers that he had in that place. And as soon as they began to arrange the women and the wounded, when a cloud of smoke began to torment them, and the fire began to surround it, because the restaurateur chief and his Rancheros guerrillas had set fire to the nearby cane fields and the fire, fueled by the burning sun and the breeze that blew abundantly, threatened the besieged caravan. Much to his regret, Suero and his harassed entourage had to continue the painful march. On January 26, 1864, he was in Altamira and was called by government; on February 9th, he was appointed Commander of Weapons of Santiago. Twenty days after the government arrived, there were reports of a threat landing at La Isabela and the famous chief of Los Rancheros was transferred to that point on the North coast, which was considered in danger.\nAs a reward for his contributions to the independence from Haiti and Spain, he was allowed to return to his position as Arms of Command in Santiago. \nSix Years\u2019 War, arrest, and death\nAlready in the sovereign republic, The brave general returned to his home in Marmolejos. In February 1873, during the Six Years\u2019 War against the anti-national dictatorship of Buenaventura B",

Mortensson sings in her native language, Southern S\u00e1mi , which is only spoken by about 500 people today.

    "\nThe Battles of Je\u0161kovo were a series of battles that occurred throughout the Kosovo War. There were two main battles, fought between the insurgent Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), and the Yugoslav forces, composed mainly of Police units.\nBackground\nMain article: Battle of V\u00ebrrin\nOn July 7,  1998, Yugoslav forces failed to liquidate a KLA unit in Billush\u00eb and Ho\u00e7\u00eb e Qytetit, near the area of V\u00ebrrin in the District of Prizren, but were forced to retreat. During the clashes, the KLA managed to blow up a Yugoslav jeep in front of a school. The Yugoslav army and police pledged retaliation for the clashes, strategizing an offensive against KLA positions in what had been declared a KLA free zone. This led to the start of the initial clashes during the Kosovo War in the area of the District of Prizren.\nFirst battle\nOn 16 July 1998, around 1:30 PM, the first battles occurred in the area of V\u00ebrrin. The Yugoslav forces tried to enter from the Tusus neighborhood, in the direction of Leskovec, Lybe\u00e7eva, and towards the village of Ho\u00e7\u00eb e Qytetit. KLA forces started attacking the Yugoslav forces with a column of 50 armored vehicles, and both sides kept fighting. The first day of confrontation between the two forces lasted 3 hours and 40 minutes. On the part of the KLA soldiers, there were neither killed nor injured, while the Yugoslav forces were separated with losses. In these battles, the KLA fighters took control over the narby villages, including Je\u0161kovo. After the Battle of Rahovec, KLA forces were forced to abandon all nearby strongholds and fortifications, but they kept position near Je\u0161kovo, where the headquarters of the 125th Brigade of Prizren was situated. Then, Hysen Rexhepi and his soldiers went to Albania to rearm for future operations in the area, like the Battles of V\u00ebrrin and the Battle of Lez.\nSecond battle\nOn 11 March 1999, Yugoslav forces of the 549th Motorized Brigade marched towards Je\u0161kovo, with the goal of retaking the city. Yugoslav soldiers and policemen, after several hours of hard climbing towards the hills around the village, arrive at these inaccessible peaks, thus they gained advantage over the KLA positions. The Serbian forces were at an altitude of 1,176 meters, while the village of Je\u0161kovo and the 125th Brigade's headquarters were located 600 meters lower. During the following fight that ensured, General Bo\u017eidar Deli\u0107 is said to have ordered to \u201cmake an effort not to let anyone remain alive\u201d or \u201cleave no one alive\u201d, by witnesses called K32 and K41. According to another witness, K58, Deli\u0107 summoned his unit and said that they were ordered \"to go and cleanse Je\u0161kovo the next day\". The same Witness claimed that General Stojan Konjikovac was in charge of executing these actions. The Yugoslav operation was successful, capturing Je\u0161kovo back from the KLA and leaving 9 killed insurgents on their side while only suffering 3 wounded policemen. Because of this operation, 500 inhabitants of the village of Ljubicevo left and migrated to other villages.\nThe K32 and K41 controversy\nK32 was a \"protected witness\" who fought under Deli\u0107 in Kosovo. Both K32 and K41 are said to have fought in the Battle of Je\u0161kovo. K32 claimed that Deli\u0107 ordered that no one should be left alive, and that the whole purpose of the Je\u0161kovo operation was to kill civilians. \u201cThis is pure fabrication by this soldier who was prepped to say this\", Deli\u0107 said. When the prosecutor asked him \"who prepped the witness\", Deli\u0107 replied: \"You are prepping your witnesses.\" The judges asked the witness to state the basis for his claim, and when he failed to do so, they cautioned him for \"presenting unsubstantiated claims\". The witness then apologized to the prosecutor and said that witness K32 was \"prepped by some Albanians in Pe\u0107\". Deli\u0107 has also denied the claim of him ordering to \"leave no one alive\". Be that as it may, the prosecutor claims the outcome of the Je\u0161kovo operation \"was consistent with the order to leave no one alive\", as all 9 KLA members were killed and there were no prisoners. General Deli\u0107, again, rejects this \"insinuation\", claiming this was a \"special KLA unit\" composed of \"hardened terrorists of the kind that does not surrender.\" The prosecutor then went on to discuss some other operations conducted by Deli\u0107's units in which a substantial number of KLA members had been killed and no prisoners had been taken. A military document signed by Deli\u0107 states that in the course of the operation near the village of Kabash, \"the Siptar terrorist forces did not throw down their weapons until the last moment, when they changed into civilian clothes and tried to break out of the encirclement.\" They ran into the siege line where 11 were killed and none were captured. On the basis of what was written there, the judges concluded that those had been \"unarmed terrorists in disguise who tried to escape but ran into an ambush,\" but Deli\u0107 claimed they had all been \"killed in combat, with their weapons in their hands or on their backs.\" K41 cl",
    "Road in Kenya\nThe A7 road is a road in Kenya that runs along the Indian Ocean coastline. It spans 428 kilometers, starting at the Tanzanian border and passing through the port city of Mombasa before ending in Lamu. The road connects various locations along the coast.\nRoute\nThe A7 highway originates at the Tanzanian border, where it connects with the Tanzanian T13 road from Dar es Salaam. From there, it proceeds as a modern, paved road along the coast to Mombasa, passing through a relatively densely populated rural area characterized by flat terrain and tropical vegetation. In Mombasa, the road becomes a multi-lane city road, crossing an estuary via the Nyali Bridge, before narrowing to a single lane and continuing north along the Indian Ocean coastline.\nThe route traverses various landscapes, including a bay near Kilifi, and forms a boundary between cultivated savannah and undeveloped forest areas. The road passes through the coastal town of Malindi and continues north, following the coast along Ungwana Bay before turning inland near Garsen. The final stretch to Lamu is also paved, winding through a cultivated rural area in the coastal plain. The A7 terminates just before reaching Lamu, which is located on an island without a bridge connection.\nHistory\nThe southern segment of the A7 highway, spanning 110 kilometers from the Tanzanian border to Mombasa, was initially designated as the A14. The subsequent sections, from Mombasa to Garsen and Garsen to Lamu, were previously numbered as the B8 and C112, respectively. In 2016, these routes were consolidated into the A7 motorway, a more significant transportation artery.\nHistorically, the original A14 has been a vital road along Kenya's east coast, and as such, it has been fully asphalted. However, a notable limitation has been the absence of a fixed crossing over the Kilindini Harbour in Mombasa. To address this, a western bypass of Mombasa was under construction in 2021, undertaken by a Japanese company. While a bridge over the harbour would be beneficial, it would require a substantial structure with a clearance height of 60 meters to accommodate the port's significant traffic. A tunnel is not feasible due to the harbour's depth.\nIn Mombasa, a pontoon bridge over Tudor Creek was initially opened in 1931, followed by a fixed box bridge with 2x3 lanes in 1980, constructed by Japan. An additional bridge is currently being built in Mombasa, with construction commencing in 2021. Between 2017 and 2021, the northernmost section of the A7, from Garsen to Lamu, was paved, completing the entire motorway.\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Kenya Roads Board\".

    "Mathematical society in Venezuela\nThe Venezuelan Mathematical Association (Spanish: Asociaci\u00f3n Matem\u00e1tica Venezolana, AMV) is a mathematical society founded in Venezuela in January 1990.\nThe AMV has chapters in four Venezuelan cities, and is a member of the Uni\u00f3n Matem\u00e1tica de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe\u00a0. It is recognised by the International Mathematics Union.\nHistory\nThe precursor to the AMV was the Venezuelan Society of Mathematics (Spanish: Sociedad Venezolana de Matem\u00e1ticas), which was founded at the Third Venezuelan Congress of Mathematicians, held in October 1980 at the University of Zulia in Maracaibo. The society functioned poorly and soon after effectively ceased to exist.\nFollowing several failed attempts at reactivating the society, the Venezuelan Mathematical Association was founded in January 1990. Within a year the AMV had branches in Caracas, Maracaibo, M\u00e9rida, and Barquisimeto.\nSince the mid 2010s the AMV has had difficulty fulfulling its duties, due to the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. The AMV has been unable to physically publish its Bulletin since 2013, and struggles to pay membership fees to the IMU. The crisis has also led many mathematicians to leave the country.\nActivities\nThe AMV organises the Venezuelan Mathematics Seminars (Spanish: Jornadas Matem\u00e1ticas Venezolanas), the first of which were held at the First Venezuelan Congress of Mathematicians in M\u00e9rida in 1977. In May 2024 the 33rd Jornadas were held as a hybrid event in Caracas.\nThe AMV also organises events to celebrate the International Day of Mathematics.\nPublications\nThe AMV publishes the Bulletin of the Venezuelan Mathematical Association (Spanish: Bolet\u00edn de la AMV), which is the preeminent Venezuelan mathematics journal.\nThe journal is indexed by zbMATH.\nGovernance\nEach regional chapter of the AMV has one representative on the board of directors.

    "Nickels Arcade interior, looking towards the east\nThe University of Michigan shapes Ann Arbor's economy significantly. It employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in the medical center. Other employers are drawn to the area by the university's research and development money, and by its graduates. High tech, health services and biotechnology are other major components of the city's economy; numerous medical offices, laboratories, and associated companies are located in the city. Automobile manufacturers, such as General Motors and Visteon, also employ residents.\nThe recent surge in companies operating in Ann Arbor has led to a decrease in its office and flex space vacancy rates. As of December 31, 2012, the total market vacancy rate for office and flex space is 11.80%, a 1.40% decrease in vacancy from one year previous, and the lowest overall vacancy level since 2003. The office vacancy rate decreased to 10.65% in 2012 from 12.08% in 2011, while the flex vacancy rate decreased slightly more, with a drop from 16.50% to 15.02%.\nHigh tech\nThe Weinmann Block is listed on the NRHP\nHigh tech companies have located in the area since the 1930s, when International Radio Corporation introduced the first mass-produced AC/DC radio (the Kadette, in 1931) as well as the first pocket radio (the Kadette Jr., in 1933). The Argus camera company, originally a subsidiary of International Radio, manufactured cameras in Ann Arbor from 1936 to the 1960s. Current firms include Arbor Networks (provider of Internet traffic engineering and security systems), Arbortext (provider of XML-based publishing software), JSTOR (the digital scholarly journal archive), MediaSpan (provider of software and online services for the media industries), Truven Health Analytics, and ProQuest, which includes UMI. Ann Arbor Terminals manufactured a video-display terminal called the Ann Arbor Ambassador during the 1980s. Barracuda Networks, which provides networking, security, and storage products based on network appliances and cloud services, opened an engineering office in Ann Arbor in 2008 on Depot St. and currently occupies the building previously used as the Borders headquarters on Maynard Street. Duo Security, a cloud-based access security provider protecting thousands of organizations worldwide through two-factor authentication, is headquartered in Ann Arbor. It was formerly a unicorn and continues to be headquartered in Ann Arbor after its acquisition by Cisco Systems. In November 2021, semiconductor test equipment company KLA Corporation opened a new North American headquarters in Ann Arbor.\nThe Germania Building Complex is listed on the NRHP\nWebsites and online media companies that once had a major presence in or near the city include All Media Guide, the Weather Underground, and Zattoo. Ann Arbor is currently the home to Internet2 and the Merit Network, a not-for-profit research and education computer network. Both are located in the South State Commons 2 building on South State Street, which once housed the Michigan Information Technology Center Foundation. The city is also home to a secondary office of Google's AdWords program\u2014the company's primary revenue stream.\nAs of 2022, Ann Arbor is home to more than twenty video game and XR studios of varying sizes. The city plays host to a regional chapter of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) which hosts monthly meetups, presentations, and educational events.\nResearch and development\nPfizer, once the city's second-largest employer, operated a large pharmaceutical research facility on the northeast side of Ann Arbor. On January 22, 2007, Pfizer announced it would close operations in Ann Arbor by the end of 2008. The facility was previously operated by Warner-Lambert and, before that, Parke-Davis. In December 2008, the University of Michigan Board of Regents approved the purchase of the facilities, and the university anticipates hiring 2,000 researchers and staff during the next 10 years.

    "Office building in Manhattan, New York\n161 Water Street (also referred to as the Water Street Associates Building and formerly referred to as 175 Water Street) is an office building in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City.\nHistory\nThree commercial buildings, constructed in the 1800s, previously occupied the site. In 1982, during the course of an archaeological excavation conducted as 161 Water Street was built, a ship dating to the 1700s was discovered. Portions of the ship and other artifacts were sent to the Mariners' Museum in Newport News.\n161 Water Street was completed in 1983. The building was designed by Fox & Fowle. Before completion, the entire building was leased to National Westminster Bank. In 1995, AIG purchased the building from National Westminster Bank. The building became AIG's headquarters in 1996, and in 2021 the firm vacated the building for a new headquarters at 1271 Avenue of the Americas.\nMetro Loft entered into contract to purchase the building from AIG in 2019. An entity linked to Ken Dart purchased the building from Vanbarton Group in 2022. Vanbarton sold the building after zoning changes that might have permitted the conversion of the building from an office property to housing did not occur.\nThe owners of the building received a tax break of $41.3 million over a 20 year period in January 2024. This tax break was granted through New York City's \"M-CORE\" program, which provides tax breaks to owners of office buildings with high vacancy rates, freeing funds for renovations. At the time the tax break was granted, 95% of the building's leasable space was empty.\nTenants\nTenants of the building include fashion brand Bode and Ghia, a beverage company.\nReferences\n^ a b Hu, Ray (February 2, 2024). \"It Follows\".

    "Return on Time Invested (ROTI) is a metric employed to assess the productivity and efficiency of time spent on a specific activity, project, or product. The concept is similar to return on investment (ROI), but instead of financial capital, ROTI measures the qualitative and quantitative outcomes derived from the time invested. The metric is relevant in contexts where time is a significant resource, including product management, personal productivity, business process optimization, and education or training evaluation.\nThe Moneylender and his Wife by Quentin Matsys (1514)\nCalculation\nWhile the specific calculation of ROTI can vary depending on the context, a general formula can be expressed as: ROTI = Total\u00a0value\u00a0or\u00a0Output\u00a0obtained / Total\u00a0time\u00a0invested.\nAfter a meeting\nSome organizations use the ROTI method to evaluate meetings.\nAreas\nProject management\nROTI is a metric used in product management to evaluate the efficiency of time allocation across various tasks and development phases. Product managers employ ROTI calculations to identify areas where time is being used effectively and those that may require optimization. This approach aids in resource allocation and productivity improvement efforts.\nPersonal productivity\nIndividuals use ROTI to enhance personal productivity by evaluating how their time is spent on different activities. This helps in prioritizing tasks that offer higher returns on time invested and minimizing time spent on low-value activities. Media outlets like Inc. frequently offer tips on maximizing personal productivity, often referencing the principles behind ROTI.\nBusiness process optimization\nOrganizations leverage ROTI to improve overall efficiency by analyzing how employee time contributes to business goals. By understanding the ROTI of different processes and functions, organizations can streamline operations and allocate resources more effectively. Reports in Harvard Business Review have highlighted case studies where businesses improved their efficiency through better time management and ROTI assessments.\nSee also\nAgile software development\nCost\u2013benefit analysis\nFeedback\nMeeting science\nOpportunity cost\nPareto principle\nPersonal development\nTime-use research\nTime value of money\nFurther reading\nTracy, Brian (2007).

    "Albanian social welfare and relief organisation\nCaritas Albania (Albanian: Caritas Shqiptar) is an Albanian Catholic not-for-profit social welfare and humanitarian relief organisation. It is a service of the Albanian Bishops' Conference.\nCaritas Albania is a member of both Caritas Europa and Caritas Internationalis.\nHistory\nIn 1993, two years after the fall of communism in Albania, the Episcopal Conference of the Albanian Catholic Church founded Caritas Albania as its social and humanitarian arm. On 3 October 1995, it was officially recognized by the Albanian state as a charitable organisation of the Albanian Catholic Church.\nIn the 1990s, Albania faced a challenging period marked by high levels of unemployment and poverty, along with an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kosovo in 1998 and 1999. In this context, Caritas Albania provided essential humanitarian aid, including the distribution of goods and making accommodation centres available, and supported impoverished individuals in becoming legal landowners.\nSince 1994, Caritas Albania has been a member of Caritas Internationalis and Caritas Europa, the global network of Catholic aid organisations.\nWork\nCaritas Albania implements a wide range of activities. In the field of humanitarian action, it supports communities after local or country-wide emergencies, including after floods such as the large-scale 2006 Albania floods, the 2008 G\u00ebrdec explosions and the 2019 Albania earthquake.\nSince the 2015 European migrant crisis, Caritas Albania has been providing support to refugees, asylum-seekers, and migrants arriving in Albania. As of 2024, the organisation is a partner of UNHCR and maintains a presence at two border points, in Kor\u00e7a and in Gjirokastra, to provide translation and counselling services. Caritas staff identify the vulnerabilities and specific needs of the individuals arriving, such as healthcare requirements, and help them meet these needs.\nAnother important pillar is the provision of social services for Albanians. Caritas Albania has been building healthcare facilities and provides services to vulnerable persons, including persons with disabilities and Roma people.\nStructure\nThe national office of Caritas Albania in Tirana.\nCaritas Albania is a network that consists of the national office located in Tirana as well as of six diocesan Caritas organisations:\nCaritas Tirana-Durr\u00ebs\nCaritas Shkodra-Pult\nCaritas Sapa\nCaritas Lezha\nCaritas Rr\u00ebshen\nCaritas Jugu (South)\nIn addition, Caritas works through 95 referral missions throughout Albania.\nPresidents\n1994-2000: Rrok Mirdita\naround 2002: Dode Gjergji\n??-2017: Gjergj Frendo\n2017-2022: Angelo Massafra\nsince 2022: Archbishop Arjan Dodaj\nReferences\n^ \"UNHCR Albania joins UN agencies in celebrating United Nations Week\".

    "Upcoming short film by Alice Rohrwacher and JR\nAn Urban Allegory (French: All\u00e9gorie citadine) is an upcoming French short film co-written and co-directed by Alice Rohrwacher and JR based on Plato's Allegory of the cave, starring Lyna Khoudri, Na\u00efm El Kaldaoui and Leos Carax. The film will have its world premiere at the 81st Venice Film Festival in the Out of Competition (Fiction) section on 1 September 2024.\nCast\nLyna Khoudri\nNa\u00efm El Kaldaoui as Jay\nLeos Carax\nProduction\nCo-directed and co-written by Italian filmmaker Alice Rohrwacher and French artist JR, An Urban Allegory is based on Plato's Allegory of the cave. The film was produced by Ad Vitam and Social Animals, and features visual effects by the Paris-based branch of the British studio Moving Picture Company (MPC). The score was composed by Thomas Bangalter.\nThe directors said about the film in a statement released in August 2024:\nWhat lies behind the daily movement of a city? Last winter, we met in Paris and began discussing the Allegory of the cave, as told in Plato's Republic. The myth imagines humanity living in chains, facing the back of a cave, and watching shadows move on the walls, thinking it is reality. We both work with images, which certainly can be illusions, but can also become instruments of struggle and liberation of thought. So, from this discussion, we decided to create a short film. We had a few fixed ideas\u2014the cave, the dance, the city bustling around us\u2014and one question: what would happen if we all managed to turn together towards the exit of the cave? Perhaps it is not enough to assert that images are illusions as long as the chains that bind us are real.\nRelease\nAn Urban Allegory will have its world premiere at the 2024 Venice Film Festival in the Out of Competition (Fiction) section on 1 September 2024.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r \"Biennale Cinema 2024 | All\u00e9gorie Citadine\".

    "Boxing match\nGreg Page vs. Tim Witherspoon, billed as True Vindication was a professional boxing match contested on March 9, 1984, for the vacant WBC heavyweight title.\nBackground\nGreg Page had become the number-one ranked heavyweight contender after defeating fellow contender Renaldo Snipes on May 20, 1983. The victory put Page in line for a title shot against the winner of the fight between reigning WBC heavyweight champion Larry Holmes and challenger Tim Witherspoon. After Holmes narrowly defeated Witherspoon by split decision, the WBC ordered Holmes to make his next defense against Page, his mandatory challenger or risk being stripped of his title. Holmes, disappointed by the $2.5 million purse he was being offered to fight Page, opted to take a more lucrative fight with Marvis Frazier which would pay him $3.1 million. WBC president Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n reiterated that Holmes would be stripped of his title should he chose to fight Frazier instead of Page confirming that Holmes had signed a WBC contract with promoter Don King to fight Page and expected Holmes to respect the contracts terms. Days later Sulaim\u00e1n had a change of heart and decided against stripping Holmes, but refused to sanction his fight against Frazier as Frazier was not among the WBC's top-10 contenders. Holmes then opted to make a title defense against Scott Frank before facing Frazier stating he would \"get around to Page\" after the holidays if the \"deal was right\".\nWith Holmes not keen to fight fight him, Page was forced to take a tune-up fight against Rick Kellar in lieu of a heavyweight title bout for which he expressed frustration  telling the media \"I'm the No. 1 contender. I'm supposed to be the one Larry's reckoning with. But that No. 1 don't mean a thing. It's just a number.\" He also expressed doubt that Holmes would ever agree to fight him saying it was like Holmes was saying \"To hell with him, let's keep him in the wings.\" After defeating both Frank and Frazier, Holmes was still unable to come to terms with Page and on December 11, 1983, officially relinquished the WBC heavyweight title in favor of recognition from the newly-formed IBF. That same day the WBC announced that the still number-one ranked Page and the number-two ranked Witherspoon would meet for the now-vacant WBC heavyweight title. Having waited for a title opportunity for the better part of a year, Page expressed both excitement and disappointment stating that while the title shot was \"something I waited for for a long time\" he \"would've liked to face Larry.\" After the fight was officially announced in early February, both Page, who entered the fight as 7\u20135 favorite, and Witherspoon bashed Holmes in the press. Page labeled Holmes a \"chicken\" while Witherspoon, whom had been defeated by Holmes the previous year and had hoped for a rematch, shared Page's sentiments stating \"The I.B.F., that ain't nothing. Holmes is running. He's supposed to be fighting Greg Page and give me a return match. How you gonna get a lot of respect running?\"\nThe fight\nThe two fighters fought a relatively close but lackluster fight and appeared sluggish as the fight went on leading to crowd to boo the lack of action, though Witherspoon served as the aggressor throughout and did just enough to earn a majority decision victory. One judge scored the fight a draw at 114\u2013114 while the two other judges scored the fight at 117\u2013111.\nAftermath\nWitherspoon admitted having trouble with Page stating after the fight \"I knew if I could get him in the center of the ring, I knew I could knock him out, but he wouldn't let me. Page, meanwhile, was so upset about his loss that he contemplated retirement saying \"This is my retirement, man. I'm through with it. It's not worth it.\"\nHolmes, now the IBF heavyweight champion, attended the fight as did then-WBA heavyweight champion Gerrie Coetzee. Holmes criticized the performance of both men telling media \"I always told you neither of them could fight.\" When asked by someone at ringside who was ahead in the fight he jokingly answered \"Where's there a fight?\"\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For WBC heavyweight title ^Note 2 For WBC and The Ring cruiserweight titles\nBroadcasting\nReferences\n^ \"Tim Witherspoon vs. Greg Page (1st meeting)\". boxrec.com.

    "\nDominican general (1818\u20131900)\nPedro Valverde Lara (July 5, 1818 \u2013 March 31, 1900) was a Dominican general and independence activist.\nEarly years\nHe was born in Ban\u00ed on July 5, 1818. He was the son of Miguel Valverde and Marcela Lara. He grew up in the Capital.\nHe was at the Puerta del Conde on the night of February 27, 1844, in which the Dominican Republic was proclaimed. During the Dominican War of Independence, he reached the rank of colonel.\nWar of Restoration\nIn 1861, when the annexation was proclaimed, he was enlisted in the reserves with the rank of general. Close defender of annexation, He served the Spanish as Governor of Santo Domingo and remained in office even after The Dominican Restoration War was in progress. The Spaniards rewarded the services of Valverde, and in October 1863, he was awarded the medal of Charles III. Valverde and Lara fell under suspicion of disaffection on the part of the Spanish and his confinement was arranged in a cell in the Ozama Fortress. General Pedro Santana interceded for him before the Captain General Carlos de Vargas and managed to have it delivered to him to take with him to the camp of Guanuma. At that point, Valverde and Lara deployed a silent and effective campaign between the soldiers, who began to defect from the anti-national side in ever-increasing quantity. The troops of San Crist\u00f3bal, in which Santana deposited a large trust, deserted en masse. He was finally discovered, arrested again and exiled on March 9, 1864, to the Spanish island of Santa Catalina, in C\u00e1diz, where he arrived the following April.\nBefore the end of the war, on his return, he approached President Pedro Antonio Pimentel and found Valverde who had been treated with disdainful coldness by President Pimentel. Angered and humiliated, he approached General Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral and, together with Eusebio Manzueta and Marcos Evangelista Ad\u00f3n, encouraged the insurrection by which Cabral overthrew Pimentel and proclaimed a new government just 27 days after the Spanish left.\nFinal years and death\nThen Pedro Valverde Lara served as the Secretary of War and Navy. Under the dictatorship of the Six Years' period, he opposed the projects for years of annexationists of Buenaventura B\u00e1ez and his clique and in 1868, at the very beginning of that regime, he returned to the jail. They sent him again to exile, from where he continued fighting against B\u00e1ez. He died at the dawn of the twentieth century, on March 31, 1900. He was 81 years old.\nSee also\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral\nMarcos Evangelista Ad\u00f3n\nPedro Santana\nCarlos de Vargas\nJuan Gervasio\nReferences\n^ Mej\u00eda, Rafael Chaljub (2007).

    "First Lady of American Somoa (1923\u20132000)\nJean Parker Haydon (1923\u20132000) served as the First Lady of American Samoa from August 1, 1969 to October 14, 1974. Born in Yakima, Washington, she married John Morse Haydon in Seattle in 1941. They had three daughters, Marti H. Jones, Molly Kramer, and Rusty Nicholson, and a son, John Robert Haydon. After her husband's governorship, the couple returned to West Seattle in 1974, where they opened an art gallery and plant shop.\nJean Haydon was active in the arts community, serving on the Washington State Arts Council. She is best remembered for initiating a program to record and preserve Samoan culture. She transformed the lower half of the Government House, the official residence, into American Samoa\u2019s first museum, making it accessible to ordinary Samoans. As a full-time volunteer, she established an arts council and American Samoa\u2019s first regional museum.\nWhen Apollo 13 returned to Earth on April 17, 1970, landing in the Pacific Ocean near American Samoa, Governor Haydon and Jean welcomed the astronauts at Pago Pago International Airport. Jean Haydon gifted each astronaut a length of tapa, a traditional Samoan cloth, for their wives.\nJean Haydon played a crucial role in starting a collection of Samoan crafts, art, and cultural artifacts. This collection was initially kept on the first floor of the Government House and later formed the basis of the Museum of American Samoa in Fagotogo. Before Governor Haydon's term ended in 1974, the Legislature honored Jean by renaming the museum the Jean P. Haydon Museum.\nJean Haydon quickly organized the museum, which officially opened on January 1, 1970, just a few months after her arrival in Tutuila on August 3, 1969. Despite her initial lack of knowledge about global collections of Samoan material culture, Jean passionately believed in the significance of their collection. She expressed this in a letter to Congresswoman Julia Butler Hansen on August 9, 1971, claiming they had the most comprehensive collection of Samoan artifacts in the world.\nReferences\n^ Seven, Richard (August 27, 1991). \u201cJohn Haydon, Ex-Commissioner Of Port, Dedicated Life To The Sea\u201d.

    "\nBaron Osip Osipovich Velio (1795\u20131867) was a cavalry general in the Russian Imperial Army, commandant of Narva and Tsarskoe Selo, and memoirist.\nBiography\nOsip Velio was born in Peterburg on January 24, 1795, in the family of a court banker of Portuguese origin, Baron Iosif Velo (1755\u20131802) and Sofya Severina (1770\u20131839), the daughter of a Hamburg merchant.\nHe received his education at the Main German School (Petrishule), where he studied from 1807 to 1812.

    "Canadian naturalist and ornithologist\nDavid Hamilton Mack Laing (6 Feb 1883 \u2013 15 Feb 1982), known for most of his life as \"Mack Laing\", was a naturalist, writer, ornithologist, artist, photographer, taxidermist and hunter who greatly increased the knowledge of Western Canadian flora and fauna in the early years of the twentieth century. He was a prolific writer about nature; about 900 of his stories appeared in popular magazines of the time. Many of his mounted bird and animal skins, collected during scientific expeditions, are in the collections of museums and universities around the world.\nEarly life and education\nLaing's parents, William Oswald Laing and Rachel Melvina Mack, met in Ontario and wed in 1874, then moved west to the pioneer township of Clearsprings, Manitoba (near Steinbach) to clear bushland and start a farm.:\u200a13\u200a When Rachel became pregnant in 1882, they temporarily returned to Hensall, Ontario to be with her parents. That is where Hamilton Mack Laing was born in February 1883. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved back to Clearsprings, and Laing was raised on their farm.:\u200a17\u200a\nEarly in life, Laing showed a strong interest in birds. He also displayed talent in sketching and painting.:\u200a41\u200a The young boy was given the responsibility of trapping \"bad\" animals, pests and predators that threatened the farm's domestic stock. By age 10, Laing was bartering mink and weasel pelts at the local general store for school supplies. At age 11, Laing was shown how to shoot a rifle:\u200a197\u200a and added crows, hawks and other carnivorous birds to his list of \"bad\" animals.:\u200a22\u200a\nAfter graduating from a local middle school, Laing moved to Winnipeg at the age of 15 to attend Winnipeg Collegiate Institute.:\u200a30\u200a Upon graduating in 1900, Laing took four months to earn a teacher's diploma.:\u200a33\u200a\nTeacher and principal\nLaing taught in various small schools for four years. During this time, Laing began to keep a daily diary of the wildlife he saw, particularly birds, a habit he would keep for the rest of his life. He also took a correspondence course in story writing, and wrote his first published story, \"The End of the Trail\", which appeared in My Tribune Sunday Magazine on 24 March 1907.:\u200a38\u200a This was the first of over 900 stories that would be published over the next seventy years.\nLaing became an art teacher for a year before becoming a high school principal in 1908, a post he would hold for 3 years. The Boy Scout movement arrived in Canada in 1908, and Laing started one of the first  troops in Canada.:\u200a39\u200a His future as an educator seemed assured. But Laing nurtured a secret dream to become a writer-naturalist.:\u200a40\u200a\nTraveller, artist and writer\nBefore colour photography, naturalists were expected to paint accurate pictures of birds. At the end of the 1911 school year, at the age of 28, Laing abruptly resigned his post as principal and moved to Brooklyn, New York to enrol as an art student at the Pratt Institute.:\u200a41\u200a He also learned photography, and started to use his photographs to illustrate the nature stories he was selling to large circulation magazines.:\u200a57\u200a\nWhile still studying art, Laing published his first book in 1913, Out with the Birds, describing the birds of Manitoba. The book was well received, and prominent scientific journal The Auk commented, \"Laing seems not only to know his birds but to know how to tell us about them, and as we turn the pages of his book we share with him the enthusiasm of the nature lover and the excitement of the bird photographer.\"\nUpon graduating from Pratt in the spring of 1914, Laing used the money he had earned from his published stories to buy himself a 1914 Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Assuming he was going to resume his teaching career again, Laing spent the summer of 1914 riding his motorcycle from Brooklyn to Winnipeg, where he applied to be an art teacher. However, a global war had broken out in Europe that had swept up Canada, and no teachers were being hired.:\u200a58\u200a Laing travelled back to New York by train, where he settled down for the winter to write more of his popular nature stories.:\u200a58\u200a\nOn the road with \"Barking Betsy\", 1915\nWhile in New York, he met Francis Harper, who had just returned from an ornithological expedition to Lake Athabasca in northern Canada, and was organizing a return expedition that he hoped would be sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution.:\u200a58\u200a Harper was an admirer of Laing's stories and asked Laing to be a part of his expedition. However, Harper was having trouble with funding, and when the project seemed to be indefinitely stalled, Laing bought another Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which he nicknamed \"Barking Betsy\". Laing rode \"Barking Betsy\" back to Winnipeg in the summer of 1915. With his younger brother Jim outfitted on Laing's older motorcycle, the two rode from Winnipeg to San Francisco, a feat of endurance given the lack of paved roads at the time. Laing's parents, William and Rachel, had retired first to Winnpeg and then to Portla",
    "\nThe Hardy Players in a scene from The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall, November 1923\nThe Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall, or, to give its full title, The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse: A New Version of an Old Story, Arranged as a Play for Mummers in One Act, Requiring No Theatre or Scenery, is a verse tragedy by Thomas Hardy based on the medieval legend of Tristan and Iseult.  His last substantial creative work, it was written, published and first performed (by an amateur group, the Hardy Players) in 1923, and revised in 1924.  It is now seldom performed and has had a mixed reception from critics.  In 1924 it was adapted as an opera by Rutland Boughton.\nSynopsis\nAfter a prologue by Merlin the play proper opens with both King Mark of Cornwall and his queen, Iseult, returning to Tintagel from separate sea-voyages.  We learn that Queen Iseult has travelled toward Brittany to find her old lover, Tristram, whom she believed to be dying, and has called off her voyage only on hearing a false report that he was already dead.  Suspicious of his wife, Mark has his man Andret keep watch on her.  Tristram now comes to Tintagel disguised as a harper, and contrives to meet the queen alone.  Tristram's wife, Iseult the Whitehanded, also arrives in search of her husband and tries to persuade him to return home.  Mark discovers Tristram's presence and fatally stabs him in the back.  The queen picks up the same dagger and kills Mark with it, then throws herself off the castle walls to her own death.  Iseult the Whitehanded enters, discovers the bodies, and sets off on her homeward journey.  The epilogue is again spoken by Merlin.\nComposition and publication\nThe history of the play goes back as far as 1870, when Hardy, living for a short while in Cornwall, began his courtship of Emma Lavinia Gifford, the woman who was to become his first wife, and visited the ruins of Tintagel Castle with her.  The version of the Tristan legend he then began to plan only started to take solid form in September 1916, after Emma's death, when he revisited Tintagel along with his second wife, Florence.  Though he soon put this project aside, he resumed it in 1923, finished a first draft in April of that year, and completed the play in August 1923.  It was published on 15 November, and appreciatively reviewed by the critics.  A second and slightly expanded edition with a different numeration of the scenes followed in 1924.\nEarly performances\nThomas Hardy (centre) attending a rehearsal of The Queen of Cornwall at the Corn Exchange, Dorchester\nThe first performance of the play was given by the Hardy Players, an amateur troupe in Dorchester, and was intended to star their leading actress, Gertrude Bugler, though her pregnancy prevented this.  Hardy himself was closely involved in the production, as was Harley Granville-Barker, an eminent theatrical figure to whom Hardy sent an early copy of the script and who responded with appreciative criticism of the play itself and of the approach to it of the Hardy Players, one of whose rehearsals he attended.  The play was performed at the Corn Exchange in Dorchester on 28, 29 and 30 November 1923, and the Hardy Players then took the production to London to be played at King George's Hall on 21 February the following year.  It was also performed in Bournemouth on 25 April 1924.  Reviews noted the difficulties presented to amateur actors by the play's archaic style, and even Hardy's wife Florence could only claim that these had been \"more or less overcome\", while admitting that the Hardy Players were better in rustic comedies.  Since 1924 there have been very few productions, though the play was notably performed on BBC radio on 28 February 1956 (repeated the following April), with Mary Morris as Queen Iseult, Rachel Gurney as Iseult the Whitehanded, and incidental music by Norman Demuth.\nLiterary sources\nThe dramatic form of The Queen of Cornwall was influenced by Hardy's respect for the conventions of Greek tragedy.  Aristotle, in his Poetics, lays down that the action should all take place in the same place and within a period of 24 hours.  Hardy followed both of these rules, and indeed the action of his play is in one unbroken sequence operating in real time.  He also employed a chorus to comment on the unfolding plot, though he called them Chanters.\nThe plot is taken from the Tristan and Isolde legend as it was told and retold in medieval and modern literature.  His medieval sources have been identified as the romances of Thomas of Britain, Gottfried von Strassburg, and Sir Thomas Malory.  The influence of Gottfried von Strassburg's Tristan has also been detected in Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure.  The original medieval form of the Tristan legend has not survived, but an attempt to reconstruct it was made by the 19th-century scholar Joseph B\u00e9dier, and Hardy is known to have owned a copy of the English translation of B\u00e9dier's work.\nIn a let",
    "Species of flowering plant\nMangifera caloneura (also known as poh in Javanese or Ma muang paa in Thai) is a fruit bearing tree in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to Mainland Southeast Asia.\nDescription\nThe tree has been observed growing up to 40 meters (130\u00a0ft) tall, however, a height of roughly 20 meters (66\u00a0ft) is much more common. It excretes a resin upon injury that sets into a black colour. The diameter of the tree's trunk varies but is typically around 60 centimetres (24\u00a0in), although it has been seen at sizes of over 1.2 metres (3\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in). It has fissured bark of a colour  that varies between black, grey and brown.\nIt's leaves are glabrous and take on an oblong to lanceolate-oblong shape. Like other Mangifera species, their texture has been described as chartaceous to subcoriaceous. The petioles are typically 2 to 7 centimetres (0.79 to 2.76\u00a0in) long. Leaf sizes vary, roughly, between a width of 3 centimetres (1.2\u00a0in) and 9 centimetres (3.5\u00a0in), as well as a length of 10 centimetres (3.9\u00a0in) to 22 centimetres (8.7\u00a0in).\nThe fruit are small compared to other species in the genus, such as Mangifera indica, however, they are similarly shaped. The fruit are 3 to 5 centimetres (1.2 to 2.0\u00a0in) in size and the seed's endosperm is ruminate. When ripe, the fruit has greenish-yellow to orange skin and the flesh is white. When fully developed, the fruit are roughly 40 grams (1.4\u00a0oz).\nIt's flowers are small, typically measuring around 0.6 to 0.8 centimetres (0.24 to 0.31\u00a0in). There are 5 stamens on each flower. The flowers have 4 to 5 petals, each is typically 0.5 centimetres (0.20\u00a0in) long. The petals are white with a longitudinal yellow colouration. The flowers stalks are very short.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe species is native to Mainland Southeast Asia. Specifically, it is native to Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar. It occurs within monsoonal deciduous forests, savannas and lowland tropical rainforests\nDue to its appearance in the local dialect, it appears to have been introduced into the more eastern islands in Southeast Asia, such as Java.\nUses\nThe young leaves of the tree can be eaten uncooked, they have been described as sour tasting. \nThe fruit itself is also eaten, the taste has been described as sweetly acidic.\nThere has been research into potential pharmacological applications of the leaf extract of Mangifera caloneura due to its antioxidant and antidiabetic properties. A 2015 study was conducted on rats that had been artificially induced with diabetes following a controlled application of streptozotocin. These rats were then given a dosage of the leaf extract at a concentration of 250\u00a0mg/kg for 6 weeks. When comparing with the control it was shown that the blood-glucose levels of the rats had significantly decreased to the point where the leaf extract may be viable as a potential diabetes medication.\nNotes\n^ The species must have been introduced to Java.\n^ Individuals in this biome tend to grow much shorter\nReferences\n^ de Kok, R. \"Mangifera caloneura\".

    "2015 rape-murder of a nurse in Malaysia\nOn 1 March 2015, a 25-year-old nurse and wife of an auxillary policeman was found with multiple slash and stab wounds at her home in Kampung Batu Papan, near Gua Musang in the Malaysian state of Kelantan. The victim, Yashmin Fauzi, gave a description and identity of her attacker who robbed, rapped and slashed her before she died. Yashmin's killer was arrested after some investigations, and it was found that the perpetrator, Mohammad Awari Ahmad, had broke into the house to commit robbery, and he also raped Yashmin before murdering her in front of Yashmin's five-year-old eldest son. Mohammad Awari was found guilty of both counts of rape and murder in 2018, and sentenced to death for the charge of murder while receiving 18 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane for the other charge of rape. Mohammad Awari lost his appeals between 2019 and 2020, but on 7 August 2024, Mohammad Awari's death sentence for Yashmin's murder was commuted to 40 years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane.\nMurder\nOn 1 March 2015, the wife of an auxillary policeman was robbed, raped and murdered at her home in Kampung Batu Papan, near Gua Musang in Kelantan.\nThe victim was identified as 25-year-old Yashmin Fauzi, who worked as a nurse and was married with three sons at the time of her death. Her 30-year-old husband Mohd Azrul Isahak, who returned home after feeling unwell at the start of his work shift, discovered the semi-naked Yashmin lying motionless outside their matrimonial home in a pool of blood, presumably taken outside by her assailant(s) or herself attempting to seek help from the neighbours. Yashmin was taken to Gua Musang Hospital for treatment, but she was pronounced dead at 6.40am. It was believed that Yashmin had been attacked by robber(s) who intruded her home while she was sleeping. There were stab and slash wounds found on the hands and neck of the victim. Gua Musang District Police Chief, Supt Saiful Bahri Abdullah also revealed that the victim's bedroom had numerous bloodstains, suggesting that the attack took place in the bedroom.\nBefore she died, Yashmin left behind a written note that pinpointed the identity and description of her attacker. One of Yashmin's sons, aged five, also told the police that he saw a \"bad man\" attacking and murdering his mother, and he was reportedly shocked and traumatized by the ordeal. The boy was the only one out of Yashmin's three sons to witness the death of his mother, because his other two brothers, aged three years and six months respectively, were asleep at that time. Kelantan Police Chief Datuk Mazlan Lazim issued a media statement, expressing his belief that with the available information that alluded to the identity of the killer, they would be able to solve the case. With the death of his wife, Mohs Azrul told a newspaper that he promised to take care of his three sons and provide them with all the love they deserved in the absence of their mother.\nShortly after the murder of Yashmin, a 22-year-old man had been arrested and investigated for the case, and the police recovered a parang, which was presumed to be the murder weapon. On 11 March 2015, the suspect, reportedly named Mohammad Awari Ahmad, was charged with murder.\nTrial of Mohammad Awari Ahmad\nThe exact date of when Mohammad Awari Ahmad's trial began was unknown, but after being in remand for a period of time, Mohammad Awari's case was officially slated for trial hearing at the Kota Bahru High Court. The prosecution was led by Deputy Public Prosecutor Shaharaliza Ab Razak, while Mohammad Awari was represented by defence lawyer Latifah Ariffin, and the trial was presided over by Judicial Commissioner Datuk Ahmad Bache.\nThe trial court was told that on the day in question, Mohammad Awari, who was formerly a sawmill worker and also a family friend of Yashmin, broke into her house in order to commit robbery, and between 12.30 and 2am, he was caught red-handed by Yashmin, who was awakened by his sounds of ransacking the house, and he attacked her and overpowered the 25-year-old victim. Mohammad Awari wielded a parang to stab and slash Yashmin several times, including twice on her neck; a pathologist confirmed that the neck wounds were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. During the course of the attack, Mohammad Awari had raped Yashmin, and Yashmin's eldest son witnessed the horrific ordeal that befell upon his mother, who was mortally wounded but managed to leave behind the identity of her killer just before she breathed her last. After the end of his monstrous acts, Mohammad Awari stole Yashmin's mobile phone and RM200 in cash, and went out to drink alcohol thereafter. Mohammad Awari reportedly denied that he had the intention of murdering the victim when his defence was called.\nOn 31 January 2018, Judicial Commissioner Datuk Ahmad Bache delivered his verdict. In his judgment, Judicial Commissioner Ahmad did not accept Mohammad Awari's claims of not having the i",
    "Political concept of domination\nNot to be confused with Dominion theology.\nIn political theory, dominion (Latin: dominium) is the exercise of authority, possession, and/or domination.\nEtymology\nThe term comes from Latin dominium, meaning \"property, ownership\", itself derived from dominus, \"lord, master\".\nIn John Wyclif's thought\nThe term is particularly associated with the thought of John Wyclif, whose works De dominio divino libri tres (\"three books on divine dominion\") and Tractatus de civili dominio (\"a discourse on civil domination\") developed his concepts of divine dominion (Latin: dominium divinum) and civil dominion (Latin: dominium civilis). Wyclif argued that divine dominion determined the fundamentals of the existence of any created thing: all other kinds of power derived from divine dominion. In Wyclif's thought, humans were granted dominion by the grace of the Christian God. Prior to the Fall of Man, this dominion was absolute and he called it natural dominion. After the Fall, humans accessed only a more limited form of dominion, constrained by human sinfulness, such as individual humans' selfish desire to exercise exclusive ownership of property. Civil dominion was the dominion exercised by fallen humans over other humans or property.:\u200a676\u201377\u200a:\u200a1434\u200a Wyclif's ideas were influential on Jan Hus and Hussite thought.:\u200a676\u201377\u200a\nReferences\n^ Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. \"dominion (n.)\" (July 2023), doi:10.1093/OED/6992135972.\n^ a b \"Censorship in the Renaissance\", in Encyclopedia of Renaissance Philosophy, ed. by Marco Sgarbi (Springer International Publishing, 2022), pp. 666-82;  ISBN\u00a09783319141695.\n^ Takashi Shogimen, \"Wyclif, John\", in Encyclopedia of Political Theory, Volume 1 ed, by Mark Bevir (SAGE Publications, 2010), pp. 1433-34.\n^ \u0160mahel, Franti\u0161ek (1993-01-01), \"The Hussite Critique of the Clergy's Civil Dominion\", Anticlericalism in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe, Brill, pp.\u00a083\u201390, doi:10.1163/9789004473713_007, ISBN\u00a0978-90-04-47371-3, retrieved 2024-08-01\n",
    "Iraqi football player\nMontader Abdel Amir Hadi (Arabic: \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0631 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0647\u0627\u062f\u064a, born 6 October 2001), is an Iraqi professional football player who plays as a winger for Al-Zawraa in the Iraqi Stars League and the Iraq U-23 national team.\nClub career\nAl-Karkh\nMontader was born in Karbala and came up through the youth teams of Iraqi giants Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, joining the first team in 2019 before going out on loan to Al-Karkh, where he would get his first taste of senior football in the Iraqi Premier League. After a successful debut season where he established himself at the Baghdad club and the Iraq U-20 national team, he extended his loan for a second season, thanking the club for giving him his first opportunity in football and praising their reputation for developing young players into the best in Iraq.\nAl-Quwa Al-Jawiya\nHe returned to his parent club in the summer of 2021 and featured regularly in the team over the next season, including the 2022 AFC Champions League where he was described as being Al-Jawiya\u2019s \u201cwinning card\u201d. Al-Jawiya extended his contract in the summer of 2022, keeping him at the club for the following season. Abdel Amir became a regular in the team and helped his side to win the Iraq Cup, beating Erbil in the final. In September 2023, Montader did not train with his teammates for several sessions whilst Al-Jawiya were preparing for their Champions League match against Uzbek side FC AGMK, because of a falling out with manager Ayoub Odisho and was seeking a move to arch rivals Al-Zawraa.\nZakho & Al-Zawraa\nZakho, who were rebuilding their team with several Brazilian players as well as national team veterans Ahmad Ibrahim and Amjad Attwan and Iraq U-23 star Ahmed Sartip, announced that they had completed the signing of Abdel Amir from Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya as they looked to break into the top 4 of the Iraq Stars League. After just half a season with the Kurdish club, Al-Zawraa showed strong interest in the young forward and pushed to sign him on the last day of the 2024 winter transfer window.\nInternational career\nAbdel Amir was called up to the Iraq U-19 national team in August 2018 to represent his country at the 2018 U-19 Asian Cup in Indonesia. The following year, in August 2019, he helped his country win the first ever U-18 West Asian Championship, which was held in Palestine, with the Iraq U-18 national team. In February 2020, Montader was part of the Iraq U-20 squad that reached the quarter finals of the 2020 U-20 Arab Cup.\nIn October 2021, Abdel Amir was called up to the Iraq U-23 national team for the 2021 WAFF U-23 Championship in Saudi Arabia where he would reach the semi-finals. He would remain in the squad for the 2022 AFC U-23 Asian Cup qualifiers later that month, where he helped his country qualify. Iraq would reach the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup before getting knocked out by hosts Uzbekistan. In March 2023, Abdel Amir was recalled to the U-23 national team for the Doha International U-23 Cup. In June 2023, he was called up again for the 2023 WAFF U-23 Championship, which they would win.

    "Large infrastructure developments in Brunei\nNot to be confused with National Development Plan.\nThe National Development Plan (NDP) or natively known as Rancangan Kemajuan Negara (RKN), is the name assigned by the government of Brunei to a plan designed to carry out Wawasan Brunei 2035 and diversify the economy by putting projects, programs, and initiatives into action. The RKN and planning were carried out under the direction of the Department of Economic Planning and Statistics (DEPS).\nIn 17 National Housing Scheme (RPN) zones covering a total area of 794 hectares (1,960 acres), 30,296 homes were built under the Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme (STKRJ) and the Land Scheme since the scheme's introduction in 1984. Under the two housing schemes, it has used land lots comprising 5,525 hectares (13,650 acres) hectares across four districts have been awarded since the program's inception in 1984. This information was disclosed on 9 February 2023. The program is administered and maintained nationally by the Housing Development Department (JKP).\nBackground\nIn the 16th century the Brunei empire was a prosperous and well-managed maritime power. But by the late 19th century, internal conflicts and abuses by foreign and local actors led to its decline, with Brunei approaching collapse by 1904. Widespread corruption, abuses of power, and a poorly planned system contributed to its deterioration, demonstrating how inadequate preparation and unclear future planning can severely undermine a state's stability.\nDuring the British Residence period (1906\u20131959), Brunei experienced significant administrative and economic changes. With a population of around 20,000 between 1906 and 1941, it wasn't until the 1960s that Brunei's demographic size began to approach the approximately 25,000 people from the mid-1850s. The first British resident, Malcolm McArthur, played a crucial role in stabilising the country's governance and geographical order by implementing key reforms. He established police stations, civil and criminal courts, mail services, customs offices, and wharves. These foundational developments set the stage for Brunei's economic recovery and growth, even before the commercial exploitation of its oil resources. Subsequent British Residents observed rapid trade growth and the country's transition towards true prosperity following years of decline.Brunei Town being attacked by a RAAF Bristol Beaufighter in 1945The discovery and commercialisation of oil marked the beginning of a transformative period for Brunei. Among the top oil producing nations in the world by the 1930s was Brunei, particularly inside the British Commonwealth. Due to its economic growth, Brunei was able to shift from \"rags to riches.\" But this progress was halted due to World War II. The Japanese occupation and subsequent Allied bombing strikes completely devastated Brunei. Seria's oil wells were set on fire, and Brunei Town was severely damaged, with just a Chinese temple still standing. With the sultanate in ashes, the war's devastation halted Brunei's economic growth.\nFollowing the Second World War the government gave food distribution and the restoration of basic necessities first priority. Reconstruction of about 200 business houses and new government offices handled much of the war damage by early 1953 as rehabilitation activities got underway swiftly. During Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III's reign, Brunei saw substantial advancements in its political system and infrastructure. His assistance was essential in bringing Brunei from under British protectorate to full independence. The 1959 Constitution of Brunei, which abolished the British Resident's power and installed a British High Commissioner in its place, was one of his greatest accomplishments. By doing this, the Sultan was given his internal sovereignty back and became the ultimate executive head of government. The five-year national development plans were introduced by the Sultan to support Brunei's post-war reconstruction and modernisation.\nRKN in the 20th century\nRKN 1 (1953\u20131958)\nBrunei Town in the 1950sThe newly built Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque in 1958Secretariat Building in 1954\nInitiated in 1953 and spanning from 1953 to 1958, the first national development plan (RKN 1) played a crucial role in the transformation of Brunei. Prior to its establishment, Brunei was seen as a less developed and economically deprived country. The strategy signaled a paradigm change that helped Brunei become a nation with high GDP per person and a high standard of living. A \"bloodless revolution\" was how observers characterised the advancement because of the extent of the improvements made, which was especially remarkable considering Brunei's tiny population at the time. the nation's first 5-Year Development Plan was started when the State Council authorised $100\u00a0million for the five-year term, because of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin III's leadership. The principal objectives were to improve living co",

    "Portrait of Reyes Heroles at the UNAM School of Law\nJes\u00fas Reyes Heroles (3 April 1921 \u2013 19 March 1985) was a Mexican politician, jurist, historian and academic affiliated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The party acknowledges him as one of its leading ideologues.\nProfessional career\nReyes Heroles was born in Tuxpan, Veracruz, in 1921. In 1939 he gained admission to the law school of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and joined the Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM), the forerunner of the later PRI. He graduated from the UNAM in 1944 and pursued studies in Argentina the following year. Between 1946 and 1963 he taught at both the UNAM and the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).\nIn the 1961 mid-term election, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for Veracruz's second district. At the end of his term in Congress he was appointed director-general of Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (PEMEX), where he remained throughout the presidential term of Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz (1964\u20131970). During his time at PEMEX he oversaw the creation of the Mexican Petroleum Institute (IMP).\nHe was president of the Institutional Revolutionary Party from 1972 to 1975 and director-general of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) from 1975 to 1976.\nIn 1976, newly elected president Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo appointed him Secretary of the Interior. He served in that position until 1979, during which time he oversaw the 1977 electoral reforms and the adoption of the Federal Law on Political Organizations and Electoral Procedures (LFOPPE). Under this law the number of federal deputies was increased, a parallel voting system was introduced, and opposition parties were allowed to register and contend in elections on a much fairer footing than what had previously been the case.\nUnder Miguel de la Madrid, L\u00f3pez Portillo's successor, Reyes Heroles served as Secretary of Public Education from 1982 to 1985.\nJes\u00fas Reyes Heroles died on 19 March 1985 in Denver, United States, where he had gone to seek medical treatment for lung cancer.\nPersonal life\nReyes Heroles was the father of Jes\u00fas Federico Reyes Heroles (1952\u20132024), director-general of PEMEX, secretary of energy and ambassador to the United States, and of Federico Jes\u00fas Reyes Heroles\u00a0 (born 1955), a noted writer and political commentator.\nReferences\n^ \"Reyes Heroles presente en la transformaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico\". pri.org.mx.

    "In this Manchu name, the given name is  Pujun. In accordance with Manchu custom, it should be used alone or with titles but not with the clan name  Aisin Gioro.\nBurubafen fuguo gong\nPujun (Chinese: \u6ea5\u5101; pinyin: P\u01d4j\u00f9n, 5 January 1886\u20131942) was a Qing dynasty imperial prince of the Aisin-Gioro. He was the second son of Zaiyi, Prince Duan. \nZaiyi sided with Empress Dowager Cixi and opposed the Hundred Days' Reform movement initiated by the Guangxu Emperor and his allies. On 22 September 1898 Cixi launched a coup d'\u00e9tat and put Guangxu under house arrest in the Summer Palace. Shortly after the coup d'\u00e9tat Guangxu's health began to decline, prompting Cixi to name an heir presumptive. Three princes were considered as potential candidates: Pujun, the second son of Prince Duan; Zaizhen, the eldest son of Prince Qing; Puwei, the eldest son of Prince Gong. Finally, Cixi chose Pujun as the heir presumptive.\nOn 24 January 1900, Pujun was titled the \"First Prince\" (\u5927\u963f\u54e5) and officially recognized as an adoptive son of the deceased Tongzhi Emperor, thereby he would have the legitimacy to inherit the throne. There were rumors that Cixi plan to depose the Guangxu Emperor and replace him with Pujun. In the same day Cixi issued a decree to the cabinet that Pujun would offer sacrifices to heaven and ancestors on behalf of the emperor in the next Lunar New Year (31 January 1900). However, this decision was not popular with Chinese bureaucrats. On 27 January 1900, Jing Yuanshan (\u7d93\u5143\u5584), the director-general of the Shanghai Telegraph Administration, sent a telegram, asking Guangxu to \"handle court affairs though you are ill, don't think about abdicating the throne.\" (\u529b\u75be\u81e8\u5fa1\uff0c\u52ff\u5b58\u9000\u4f4d\u4e4b\u601d) The co-signers were Ye Han, Ma Yuzao, Zhang Binglin, Wang Yinian, Ding Huikang and Shen Xin. 1,231 celebrities, including Tang Caichang, Jing Hengyi, Cai Yuanpei and Huang Yanpei, published an announcement to all provinces at the same time, asking all provinces to jointly fight, \"If the court ignores it, we will ask all the industrial and commercial merchants to go on strike to discuss the matter.\" (\u5982\u671d\u5ef7\u4e0d\u7406\uff0c\u5247\u8acb\u6211\u8af8\u5de5\u5546\u901a\u884c\u7f77\u5e02\u96c6\u8b70) Later, the ministers of foreign countries also did not recognise Pujun's legitimacy except for the Russian minister. Finally, Cixi was forced to abandon the plan.\nPrince Duan, the biological father of Pujun, fell out of favor with the Empress Dowager after the Boxer rebels were defeated by the Eight-Nation Alliance. Pujun was stripped of his princely title, forced to leave the Forbidden City and lived in the Prince Dun's Mansion (\u60c7\u89aa\u738b\u5e9c). He changed his life completely, smoking opium and living a life of debauchery. After the Xinhai Revolution he served as an advisor to the president until 1921. Pujun lost his official position in a political upheaval, his annual income stopped, and his fortune was deplete. He spent his last years living with the help of his brother-in-law, Tawangbulagjal, Prince Alxa. He died in poverty in 1942. His family had no money to bury him, so they had to temporarily place his coffin in Jiaxing Temple (\u5609\u8208\u5bfa).:\u200a112\u2013113\u200a His body was buried on the spot after the founding of the People's Republic of China.\nReferences\n^ \u90ed\u536b\u4e1c (1990). \"\"\u5df1\u4ea5\u5efa\u50a8\"\u82e5\u5e72\u95ee\u9898\u8003\u6790\". \u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u5b66\u62a5\uff1a\u54f2\u5b66\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7248 (in Chinese) (1990\u5e74\u7b2c5\u671f).

Her older brother, Kharis Jumagulovich Jumagulov (1891\u20131937), was one of the leaders of the Bashkir independence movement.\nIn 1917, Rabiga Jangulowna participated in the work of the Bashkir Kurultai in Orenburg as a delegate of the Bashkirs of the Pugachyov Uyezd. At this assembly, she advocated for the equality of Bashkir women. She demanded full civil and political rights for women, equal to those of men, and proposed specific measures to realize these demands. Her ten points for gender equality were included in the Kurultai's resolution.\nIn 1919, Rabiga Jangulowna became the head of the Women's Affairs Department of the Bashkir Regional Committee of the CPSU. Together with others, she organized the All-Bashkir Conference of Women Workers and Peasants, which took place in Sterlitamak in September 1920. In November 1921, she participated in the IX session of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets in Moscow. She was involved in organizing and preparing the I All-Bashkir Congress of Women Workers and Peasants, which took place in November 1924, and the All-Bashkir Women's Congress in the Soviet, held in October 1927.\nRabiga Jangulowna married Khafis Kuschayevich Kuschayev (1888\u20131937) in 1922, who had been a soldier in the Imperial Russian Army and participated in the Bashkir independence movement after the October Revolution.\nIn 1927, Kuschajewa became the director of the Khudaiberdin Children's Home in Ufa. In 1929, she became an inspector of the Department of Children's Homes of the People's Commissariat for Education of the RSFSR in Moscow.\nIn the summer of 1937, Kuschajewa died in a fatal accident while returning home by electric train. In the same year, during the Great Purge, her husband was executed as a Bashkir nationalist on September 27 (rehabilitated in 1957) and her brother was shot in December (rehabilitated in 1959).\nKuschajewa had three children. Her first daughter, Minsylu, died of diphtheria in 1923. Her second daughter, Tansylu (Dina) (1925\u20131996), became a ballerina in Perm. After the death of their parents, their five-year-old son, Irek, was sent to an orphanage.\nReferences\n^ \u0421\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0420. \u041d.

    "The Hungarian Society for Urban and Spatial Planning (Hungarian: Magyar Urbanisztikai T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g, MUT) is the main institute of spatial planning and urban planning in Hungary. Founded in 1966, the society aims to promote the activities and profession of planning in Hungary and is coordinating the activities of all planners across the country. The society organizes annual meetings, most importantly the National Urban Conference (Orsz\u00e1gos Urbanisztikai Konferencia) and honors leading urbanists, as well as municipalities with remarkable development with its J\u00e1nos Hild Award. The organization is a member of the European Council of Spatial Planners.\nFunctions\nThe aim of the Society is to make Hungarian urbanism, consisting of the coordinated activities of many different professions as efficient and effective as possible.\nExploring new professional knowledge and gathering national and international experience of practice, and sharing it with the membership.\nTo define the knowledge and standards required for working as an expert in the field of spatial and urban development, and to regularly review the scope of these standards on the basis of socio-economic and technological trends.\nImproving the conditions for professional practice, developing and promoting theoretical and practical activities, and encouraging the spread of a broad urbanistic approach in Hungary.\nHistory\nIstv\u00e1n Sarl\u00f3s, the first president of the MUT\nThe leadership of the one-party led socialist Hungary emphasized the significance of the application of modern urban planning principles. This led to the foundation of the Hungarian Society for Urban and Spatial Planning in 1966. The founding members of the society came from a wide range of scientific fields, including demographists, sociologists, architects, transportation specialists, hygienists and politicians. Initially the institution operated under tight political control, its first secretary, Istv\u00e1n Sarl\u00f3s was a high ranking communist politician as well: at that time he was the Chairman of the Budapest City Committee, practically the mayor of the capital city. Thanks to the state's financial and political support the MUT quickly grew to become the largest forum of urbanism in Hungary.\nAfter the fall of the socialist regime in Hungary the MUT underwent considerable changes. The society almost completely changed its leadership and at the same time it lost its financial background provided by the state. After a brief crises the MUT restarted its meetings, conferences and it also participated in the new democratic government's adversary council, the National Forum on Urban Issues (Nemzeti Telep\u00fcl\u00e9s\u00fcgyi F\u00f3rum), which reviewed newly proposed urbanism-related laws. Besides its regular activities, the leadership of the society occasionally publicly states its stance on controversial projects through resolutions. In a resolution issued in 2024 the MUT called for a number of changes in the government's plans for the transformation of the brownfield territories of R\u00e1kosrendez\u0151 train station to a business centre with high rising buildings.\nRegional groups and professional departments\nFor more efficient work, members of the Hungarian Society for Urban and Spatial Planning can form smaller regional groups (ter\u00fcleti csoport) and professional departments (szakmai tagozat) which are focused on the questions of a certain region or planner group. Most counties in Hungary have their own regional group, and there is a wide range of professional departments as well, like the Young Urbanists Department (Fiatal urbanist\u00e1k tagozat), the Village Department (Falutagozat), the Administration Department (Igazgat\u00e1si tagozat) the Urban Economics Department (V\u00e1rosgazdas\u00e1gi tagozat) and many more.\nAwards\nJ\u00e1nos Hild Award\nJ\u00e1nos Hild Award of Szeged, awarded in 2023\nFounded in 1968, the most important prize of the Hungarian Society for Urban and Spatial Planning was named after J\u00e1nos Hild, one of the first city planners of Hungary. Candidates for the award compete in two main categories: local governments of towns, villages and the districts of the capital city can be awarded for a longer-term development process of their settlement with the application of the principles of modern urbanism. Winner municipalities erect a statue usually featuring the enlarged version of the award. Besides municipalities, individuals are awarded as well, for outstanding professional, scientific, educational, or social work in the fields of spatial planning, urban planning, urban development, and urban rehabilitation.\nOther awards\nAward of Excellency for the Revitalization of Public Places (K\u00f6zt\u00e9rmeg\u00faj\u00edt\u00e1si N\u00edv\u00f3d\u00edj): In cooperation with the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) the MUT created an annually distributed award in 2009, to recognize successful rehabilitation programs of public parks, squares, streets and other important public spaces.

    "Indonesian guitarist\nAries Tanto (better known by the nickname Ebenz) was an Indonesian guitarist known as one of the founders of the band Burgerkill. The band was formed by him along with his high school friends in 1995. They released their first album, Dua Sisi, in 2000. Internationally, the band received the Metal As F*ck award from the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards in 2013.\nPersonal life\nAries Tanto grew up in Jakarta and earned the nickname Ebenz because he often acted as the payer during gatherings with his friends near his grandmother's residence in the Manggarai area, thus he was called Bento, inspired by the song Iwan Fals titled \"Bento\" (Swami I). When he transferred from SMAN 82 Jakarta to SMAN 1 Ujungberung (now SMAN 24 Bandung), his friends at school started calling him \"Ebenz\".\nEbenz learned to play guitar at the age of twelve and was interested in guitar techniques from bands such as Hacride, Gojira, Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth. In addition, during high school, Ebenz also had a large collection of Punk and Rock music.\nEbenz married Anggi Pratiwi on 25 June 2006 and had three children.\nCareer\nBurgerkill\nEbenz and Kimung (Sonic Torment) formed the band Morning Crew. The band performed songs from bands such as Black Flag, Exploited, and other punk-hardcore bands. After a brief time with Morning Crew, Ebenz and Kimung invited Ivan Scumbag (Infamy) and Kudung (Forgotten) to form Burgerkill on 11 May 1995, with the lineup of Ebenz (guitar), Kimung (bass), Ivan (vocals), and Kudung (drums), initially as a 'project' band covering songs from bands like Sick Of It All, Wide Awake, and Gorilla Biscuits before creating their own songs.\nMusic projects\nShortly after Burgerkill released Beyond Coma and Despair in 2006, Eben and Irvine Jastra hosted the \"Radio Distorsi\" program on a radio station to promote underground music and provide information about the development of independent bands in Bandung, but the show ended in 2009. Afterwards, together with Gebeg (Taring), Eben formed \"Extreme Moshpit\" with its debut broadcast on Radio Oz Bandung in January 2010, with an improved concept, including organizing music shows and awards for independent bands.\nDeath\nEbenz passed away on September 3, 2021, at 16:15 at the age of 46. The cause of death was a heart attack. It was reported that he had previously fainted and was then rushed to the hospital. His body was laid to rest in his yard in Bandung, West Java.\nInstruments\nDiscography\nBurgerkill\nMain article: Burgerkill discography\nStudio albums\n2000 \u2013 Dua Sisi\n2003 \u2013 Berkarat\n2006 \u2013 Beyond Coma and Despair\n2011 \u2013 Venomous\n2018 \u2013 Adamantine\nCompilations, EPs, and singles\n1997 \u2013 \"Revolt!\"\n1997 \u2013 \"Offered Sucks\"\n1997 \u2013 \"Myself\"\n1997 \u2013 \"Blank Proudness\"\n1999 \u2013 Threeway Split Release EP\n2000 \u2013 \"Everlasting Hopes Never Ending Pain\"\n2020 \u2013 Killchestra EP\nCollaborations\n2016 \u2013 \"Perang\" \u2013 Aftercoma (Against the Sun)\nNominations and awards\nReferences\n^ a b c Roche, Sam (6 September 2021). \"Burgerkill founding guitarist Aries Tanto \u2013 aka Eben \u2013 dies aged 46\".

    "UNESCO World Heritage Site in Kagoshima, Japan\nJapan\u2019s Meiji Industrial Revolution sites map Kagoshima\nThe 'Kagoshima Spinning Mill\u2019 (\u9e7f\u5150\u5cf6\u7d21\u7e3e\u6240\u8de1, Kagoshima b\u014dsekijo ato) is a former cotton spinning mill constructed in the Bakumatsu period by Satsuma Domain in the Yoshino neighborhood of the city of Kagoshima Japan. The surviving residence for foreign engineers was designated a National Historic Site in 1959, and the site as a whole was later designated a component of the Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution: Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding and Coal Mining, which received UNESCO World Heritage Site status in 2015.\nOverview\nDuring the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate, Shimazu Nariakira, the daimy\u014d of Satsuma Domain, was greatly interested in Dutch studies and convinced that Japan needed to industrialize and develop militarily and economically to avoid colonization by the Western powers. As a result, in 1857 he constructed the Sh\u014dko Sh\u016bseikan, the first Western-style factory in Japan, to create the materials needed for shipbuilding as well as products for exporting. Some 1,200 craftsmen worked at these factories every day, but after his death, operations were scaled back, and in 1863, almost everything except the reverberatory furnace was burned down during the Bombardment of Kagoshima.\nHis successor, Shimazu Tadayoshi, planned to rebuild Sh\u014dko Sh\u016bseikan and construct a Western-style textile mill, so sent 19 students to England in 1865. He purchased the necessary machinery through Godai Tomoatsu from the Platt Brothers, including more than 150 spinning machines, including cotton openers, carding machines, spindle spinning frames, and power looms, powered by a steam engine. The domain also invited seven British engineers to Kagoshima to install the machinery and provide operational guidance. These were the predecessors of the O-yatoi Gaikokujin who would later be employed by the Meiji government. Raw cotton was mainly purchased from the Kansai region, and over 200 workers spun 180 kg of cotton in a 10-hour day. In 1869, the mill produced 65,000 bolts of white cotton and 2,600 jin of kasuri cloth, which were sold mainly in the Kansai region.\nKagoshima Spinning Mill Foreign Engineers' Residence\nThe Kagoshima Foreign Engineers' Residence (\u9e7f\u5150\u5cf6\u7d21\u7e3e\u6240\u6280\u5e2b\u9928, Kagoshima b\u014dsekijo gishikan (Ijinkan)) was a building constructed for use by foreign engineers hired by the domain to establish the mill.  It was completed in 1867 and was a two-story wooden structure painted white on the west side of the factory, with a floor area of approximately 344 square meters. However, due to the increasing political instability in Japan, the engineers returned to the United Kingdom after only one year. the building was subsequently used as an office for a cannon factory, and in 1877 it was requisitioned as a temporary hospital by the Satsuma forces in the Satsuma Rebellion. \nIn 1884, the building was relocated to the site of Kagoshima Castle, but in 1936 was restored to its original location. The was initially thought to have been designed by Thomas Waters, who was also involved in the design of Ginza Bricktown, but because Waters had been building a sugar mill on Amami Oshima since 1866, it is now believed to have been designed and supervised by an Englishman connected to spinning mills.\nIn 1962 the building was designated an Important Cultural Property. \nAs a result of excavation work in 2010, the remains of the foundations of the main body of the Kagoshima Spinning Mill were discovered in the neighboring area, and on October 17, 2013, the designated area was expanded and the designated name of the National Historic Site was changed from \"Kagoshima Spinning Mill Engineers' House (Ijinkan)\" to \"Kagoshima Spinning Mill Site\".\nSee also\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Kagoshima)\nSites of Japan\u2019s Meiji Industrial Revolution: Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding and Coal Mining\nReferences\n^ \"\u9e7f\u5150\u5cf6\u7d21\u7e3e\u6240\u8de1\" (in Japanese).

    "Belgian motocross racer\nNot to be confused with Sasha Cohen or Sacha Baron Cohen.\nSacha Coenen (born 9 November 2006) is a Belgian professional Motocross racer. Coenen has competed in the Motocross World Championship since 2022 in the MX2 class. He currently competes for the Red Bull KTM Factory Racing team.\nCoenen took his first overall Grand Prix win during the 2024 FIM Motocross World Championship by winning the MX2 class at the Latvian round.\nCoenen is the twin brother of Lucas Coenen, who is also a World Championship-level motocross racer.\nCareer\nJunior Career\nAlongside his brother, Coenen debuted in the European Motocross Championship in 2016, in the 65cc class. Returning the following year, he was able to finish tenth overall in the same class. In his first season in the 85cc class in 2018, Coenen competed on a small wheel machine for most of the year due to his size. The Coenen brothers competed around Europe in 2019, joining the Grizzly Racing Yamaha team for their second season in the 85cc class. This resulted in him winning the 85cc class at the Coupe de l'Avenir event and scoring points in both the European Motocross Championship and the FIM Motocross Junior World Championship. 2020 was Coenen's final year racing an 85, this time on a KTM. This saw him win the Espoirs 85cc class as part of the French Elite Motocross Championship, winning all but one race on the way to this title.\nFollowing his success on an 85, Coenen moved up to compete full-time in the EMX125 class of the 2021 European Motocross Championship for the Bud Racing team. At the first round of the season, Coenen immediately showed his potential, qualifying second and finishing third in the opening race. By the third round in Germany, he was able to take his first European Championship-level race win. A hand injury stopped him racing in the final four rounds of the season and he eventually finished fifteenth in the final standings. In addition, Coenen finished runner-up behind his brother in the Junior 125cc of the French Elite Motocross Championship, winning three races and two overall rounds.\n250 Career\nContinuing his rapid rise through the ranks Coenen, alongside his brother, moved to the Jumbo Husqvarna BT Racing Team for the EMX250 class of the 2022 European Motocross Championship. The young Belgian rider showed race winning speed throughout the season, but crashes cost him notable results - such as in the second race at the German round when he was leading. This combined with two rounds missed due to injury saw him finish nineteenth in the standings. Alongside this he also made his FIM World Motocross Championship debut in the MX2 class at the Czech round.\nAfter this single season in EMX250, Coenen was signed by the Red Bull KTM Factory Racing team to compete in the MX2 class of the 2023 FIM Motocross World Championship. At a pre-season race he picked up a dislocated shoulder which saw miss the first four rounds of the championship. Upon his return, Coenen quickly proved his competitiveness with several top-ten finishes throughout the rest of the season. Sixth overall at the Swedish round was his highest result on the way to fourteenth in the final standings. The 2024 season saw Coenen continue his rapid adaption to the MX2 class, as he scored regular holeshots to lead races and contend for finishing positions in the top-six places. This went alongside multiple crashes which saw him miss some notable results, such as at the sixth round in Galicia where he crashed on the last lap of the qualifying race whilst leading. By the ninth round in Latvia, he was able to transform his speed into taking his first race win and with it his first overall grand prix victory. A week later, Coenen was able to win his second grand prix overall at the Maggiora track in Italy.\nHonours\nFrench Elite Motocross Championship\nJuniors: 2021 \nEspoirs: 2020 \nCoupe de l'Avenir\n85cc: 2019 \n65cc: 2017 \nCareer statistics\nFIM Motocross World Championship\nBy season\nGrand Prix wins\nReferences\n^ \"Sacha Coenen Bio\". mxgpresults.com.

    "2015 young adult novel by Jason Reynolds\nThe Boy in the Black Suit is a 2015 young adult novel by Jason Reynolds.\nIt is a 2016 Coretta Scott King Award honor book.\nPlot\nReception\nThe Boy in the Black Suit received mixed reviews from critics, who often found the plot to be lacking, despite strongly-written characters.\nPublishers Weekly referred to The Boy in the Black Suit as \"an affecting story,\" while Kirkus Reviews called it \"a vivid, satisfying and ultimately upbeat tale of grief, redemption and grace.\" They highlighted how \"Reynolds writes with a gritty realism that beautifully captures the challenges\u2014and rewards\u2014of growing up in the inner city.\" According to School Library Journal, the \"sensitive novel  reads like a light vignette\", despite dealing with \"weighty subjects.\"\nReviewers often praised Reynold's character development, with School Library Journal writing, \"He excels at writing an authentically teenage voice  and his characters are believable without being predictable.\" They added, \"Reynolds has a great ear for dialogue overall and his transitions into memories and back to the present of the narrative are seamless.\" Booklist's Michael Cart called the protagonist \"a wonderfully sympathetic, multidimensional character whose voice is a perfect match for the material and whose relationships  are beautifully realized.\"\nHowever, reviewers often criticized the plot development, with Publishers Weekly noting that the novel's \"faults offset its strengths\". They pointed to \"coincidences and plot twists\" that \"detract from the impact of the story as it develops\", as well as the fact that the \"romantic interest  doesn\u2019t come on the scene until halfway through the book, and the wait feels long.\" Cart agreed the novel \"gets off to a slightly slow start\". However, he found that it \"quickly becomes a superb, character-driven story.\" School Library Journal added, \"By the end of the novel, some of those plot threads are left dangling. Endings wrapped up like presents are not the right thing for every book, but some of these subplots  are tied to characters whose lives were so integral to the main story. When a character is that important and developed, it seems odd when his story just fades away.\"\nBooklist also reviewed the audiobook narrated by Corey Allen.\nIn 2016, The Boy in the Black Suit was named a Coretta Scott King honor book, and the Young Adult Library Services Association included it on their list of the Best Fiction for Young Adults.\nReferences\n^ a b \"The Boy in the Black Suit by Jason Reynolds\".

He served one term in the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing northwestern Rock County as a Whig during the 1851 term.\nBiography\nJohn D. Seaver was born on June 7, 1795, in Augusta, New York.  He most likely moved to Charlotte, New York, when his parents became pioneer settlers there in 1809.  During the War of 1812, he enlisted in the New York militia and served in the militia company of Captain Martin B. Tubb.\nHe married Harriet Love and they moved to Rock County, Wisconsin, where he established a farm in the town of Porter.\nSeaver was involved in Whig and Republican politics. He attended the Whig Party convention in Rock County's 3rd Assembly district on Saturday, October 27, 1849, to select their candidate for Wisconsin State Assembly in the 1849 election.  At the time, Rock County's 3rd district comprised the northwest corner of the county, including the towns of Magnolia, Union, Porter, and Fulton. At the informal convention vote, Seaver received 4 votes, losing to Leander Hoskins with 5 votes. In the formal vote, Seaver lost to Hoskins 7\u20135.  Hoskins went on to win the election and represented Rock County's 3rd Assembly district in the 1850 term.\nIn 1850, John was he Whig Party nominee and was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in the Rock County 3rd district.  He served in the 4th Wisconsin Legislature from January 6, 1851, to January 5, 1852. Seaver was a delegate from Porter to the 1861 Republican Convention for Rock County, Wisconsin.\nSeaver died on February 2, 1886, at the age of 90.\nPersonal life and family\nJohn Devine Seaver was the second of nine children born to Robert Whitmore Seaver and his wife Anna (n\u00e9e Edson).  Robert W. Seaver enlisted in the Continental Army at age 14 (about 1777) and served in the American Revolutionary War until the surrender of Lord Cornwallis in 1781, attaining the rank of sergeant.  Later in life, Robert was the founder of Charlotte, New\u00a0York, in 1809.  The Seavers are descended from Robert Seaver, who emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from England in 1634.\nReferences\n^ a b Heg, J. E., ed. (1882). \"Annals of the Legislature\".

    "Historic restaurant in Anseong, South Korea\nAnilok (Korean:\u00a0\uc548\uc77c\uc625; Hanja:\u00a0\u5b89\u4e00\u5c4b) is a historic Korean restaurant in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. It was established around 1920, making it one of the oldest active restaurants in South Korea. It specializes in the beef soup dish seolleongtang, and is among the oldest gukbap restaurants in Gyeonggi Province.\nDescription\nThe store reportedly has three gamasot cauldrons that are cooking at all hours. One pot is for making seolleongtang, another is for gukbap, and the last is for galbi-tang. The pots are periodically emptied, and the broth remade with new ingredients.\nHistory\nThe restaurant first opened around 1920 by Lee Seung-rye (\uc774\uc2b9\ub840), the grandmother of the current owner. At that time, Lee's husband, who was in his early 40s, became sick. To raise money, she sold gukbap at the local marketplace, using meat she obtained at the nearby cow marketplace. The dish was often improvized, based on whatever ingredients she could access; as such she called it utang (\uc6b0\ud0d5; \u725b\u6e6f; lit.\u00a0cow stew). Lee reportedly spent significant time each day trying to acquire ingredients for the soup from various butchershops. In 1937, nineteen-year-old Lee Yanggwibi (\uc774\uc591\uadc0\ube44) married a son of Lee Seung-rye, and began helping her mother-in-law with the business. Other members of the family also contributed to its operation; the men carried wood and performed labor. Just before the outbreak of the 1950\u20131953 Korean War, Lee Yanggwibi took over the business. Sales reportedly actually improved during the war, as refugees frequented the business. By 1952, they were able to purchase a restaurant building in a central location.\nEven until after the Korean War, the business was reportedly nameless. When they tried to apply for a business license at a government office, they were reportedly asked \"how can you do business without a business name?\" (\uc0c1\ud638 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc7a5\uc0ac\ud558\ub290\ub0d0), and the office worker came up with the name Anilok on the spot. The name literally means \"An one store\", and is interpreted as \"the most relaxing business in Anseong\" (\uc548\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc77c \uac00\ub294 \ud3b8\uc548\ud55c \uac00\uac8c).\nIn 1997, third generation owner Kim Jong-yeol (\uae40\uc885\uc5f4) took over the business. In 2021, it was reported that Kim's son Kim Hyeong-u (\uae40\ud615\uc6b0) was planning to take over the business next.\nThe restaurant was featured in the television program Baek Jong-won's Top 3 Chef King.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f \uc784, \uba85\uc218 (2021-05-22). \"\uc81c\uc57d\ud68c\uc0ac \ud1f4\uc9c1\uae08\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ucf1c\ub0b8 \ud560\uba38\ub2c8\uc758 100\ub144 \uc6b0\ud0d5 '\ubc25\uc7a5\uc0ac \uc815\uc2e0'\".

    "Transportation in Ann Arbor, Michigan is served by several highways, Amtrak and intercity bus lines, and the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport. Local public transportation is provided by Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority (AAATA).\nStreets and roads\nThe streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though this pattern is less common in the surrounding areas. Major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. The city is belted by three freeways: I-94, which runs along the southern and western portion of the city; U.S. Highway 23 (US\u00a023), which primarily runs along the eastern edge of Ann Arbor; and M-14, which runs along the northern edge of the city. Other nearby highways include US\u00a012 (Michigan Ave.), M-17 (Washtenaw Ave.), and M-153 (Ford Rd.).\nSeveral of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 interchange in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas. Over 80,000 people commute into Ann Arbor each day from surrounding areas.\nPublic transportation\nAn AAATA bus in front of the Blake Transit Center\nThe Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority (AAATA), which brands itself as \"TheRide\", operates public bus services throughout the city and nearby Ypsilanti. The AATA operates the Blake Transit Center on Fourth Ave. in downtown Ann Arbor, and the Ypsilanti Transit Center.\nA separate zero-fare bus service operates within and between the University of Michigan campuses. Since April 2012, the \"AirRide\" connects to Detroit Metro Airport a dozen times a day.\nIntercity buses\nGreyhound Lines provides intercity bus service. The Michigan Flyer, a service operated by Indian Trails, cooperates with AAATA for their AirRide and additionally offers bus service to East Lansing. Megabus has direct service to Chicago, Illinois, while a bus service is provided by Amtrak Thruway for rail passengers making connections to services in East Lansing and Toledo, Ohio.\nWalking and cycling\nAnn Arbor is considered one of the US's most walkable cities, with one sixth of Ann Arborites walking to work according to the 2020 census. Ann Arbor has a gold designation by the Walk Friendly Communities program. Since 2011, the city's property taxes have included a provision for sidewalk maintenance and expansions, expanding the sidewalk network, filling sidewalk gaps, and repairing existing sidewalks. The city has created a sidewalk gap dashboard, which showed 143 miles of sidewalk gaps in May 2022. The outlying parts of the city and the township districts between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti still contain markedly unwalkable areas.\nIn 2019, 36% of trips in Ann Arbor were taken by walking, biking or transit. In 2020, the city introduced a Healthy Streets program to encourage non-motorized transportation. Between 2019 and 2022 Ann Arbor's Downtown Development Authority built four two-way protected bikeways downtown. Early studies have shown a significant increase in bicycle use downtown since the construction of these bikeways. In 2023, the city reported over 900 bicycle parking spaces downtown, though this is still a small portion compared to the over 8,000 car parking spots for cars.\nThe Washtenaw County Border-to-Border Trail connects Ann Arbor to Ypsilanti, mostly along the Huron River, for pedestrians, bicycles and other non-motorized transportation. In 2017, Spin scooters started providing a scooter share program in Ann Arbor, expanding this to include dockless e-bikes in 2023.\nRailroads\nMichigan Central Depot, Ann Arbor\nThe city was a major rail hub, notably for freight traffic between Toledo and ports north of Chicago, Illinois, from 1878 to 1982; however, the Ann Arbor Railroad also provided passenger service from 1878 to 1950, going northwest to Frankfort and Elberta on Lake Michigan and southeast to Toledo. (In Elberta connections to ferries across the Lake could be made.) The city was served by the Michigan Central Railroad starting in 1837. The Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti Street Railway, Michigan's first interurban, served the city from 1891 to 1929.\nAmtrak, which provides service to the city at the Ann Arbor Train Station, operates the Wolverine train between Chicago and Pontiac, via Detroit. The present-day train station neighbors the city's old Michigan Central Depot, which was renovated as a restaurant in 1970.\nReferences\n^ Official 2007 Department of Transportation Map (Map). 1\u00a0in:15\u00a0mi/1\u00a0cm:9\u00a0km.

    "Indigenous Tasmanian leader\n1835 painting of Woureddy by Thomas Bock\nWoureddy (c.1790 \u2013 7 July 1842), also known as Wurati, Woorady and Mutteelee, was a leading warrior and cleverman from the Nuenonne clan of Aboriginal Tasmanians in Australia. \nHe acted as a guide for George Augustus Robinson in his expeditions to round up the remaining Indigenous people of Tasmania during the early 1830s.\nWoureddy was a highly significant figure in communicating Indigenous culture to Robinson and his disclosures remain a prime source of information about pre-colonial Aboriginal Tasmanian customs. He was also the husband of Truganini for period of around ten years.\nHis image, and the busts of him and Truganini have over time been utilised and incorporated in conversations about the past in Tasmania.  The image by Thomas Bock is utilised in Cassandra Pybus's biography of Truganini.\nEarly life\nWoureddy was born around the year 1790 on Nuenonne country which included the region around Bruny Island (Lunawanna-alonnah) and Recherche Bay (Lyleatea) in southern Tasmania.\nAs a young child he remembered observing the French explorers, led by Rear Admiral Bruni D'Entrecasteaux and Captain Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec arriving in Recherche Bay in 1792. The French came ashore and carved images on a tree which the Nuenonne were terrified of, later destroying the tree thinking it was the work of the evil spirit they called Rageowrapper.\nIn 1804, Woureddy also witnessed the arrival of the British ships to colonise what is now the Hobart (Nibbaluna) region. He remembered the resultant conflict between the invaders and the resident Mouheneena clan who lived there in a village called Kreewer upon which the suburb of Sandy Bay is now located.\nHe also recalled white shingle-splitters abducting local black women from around the Huon River and shooting the black men if they resisted the taking of the females.\nAs a young man, Woureddy's life was still lived in a mostly traditional way isolated from the influence of the British colonists. He grew his hair into a distinctive mop of dreadlocks styled with red ochre and animal fat. His family were esteemed warriors with his brother a renowned strongman. When his brother was killed in inter-tribal conflict, Woureddy took vengeance by raping and killing his brother's former wife who was implicated in his brother's death.\nWoureddy was also considered a cleverman and custodian of his people's culture and beliefs. He excelled in the construction of catamarans, which the Nuenonne and associated clans used to conduct dangerous voyages to offshore islands such as De Witt Island to hunt seals. These vessels were made large enough to fit eight men.\nHe married and had three sons, the oldest named Myunge born around 1818 and the second was called Droyerloine born around 1820. The youngest child's traditional name is unknown.\nAssociation with George Augustus Robinson\nBy the late 1820s, the British had expanded their hold in Van Dieman's Land (as Tasmania was then known), and established several whaling and lumber stations on Bruny Island. Violence, displacement and disease brought by the British had a hugely detrimental effect to the lives of the Nuenonne.  In 1828, the Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land, Colonel George Arthur, ordered the creation of an Aboriginal ration station on the island, which in 1829 was placed under the authority of an English builder and evangelical Christian named George Augustus Robinson.\nWith the assistance of a local female teenager named Truganini, Robinson initially had some success protecting the Indigenous people at his establishment. But by October 1829, the deaths continued and only a handful of Nuenonne had survived. Woureddy's wife and youngest child died of illness. To strengthen paternal bonds he had with the survivors, Robinson oversaw the partnering of the newly widowed Woureddy with the much younger Truganini.\nThe \"friendly mission\"\nBronze bust of Woureddy\nRealising that the Aboriginal station at Bruny Island was doomed, Robinson formulated a scheme to use Woureddy, Woureddy's two sons, as well as Truganini and a few other captured Aboriginal people such as Kikatapula and Pagerly, to guide him to the clans residing in the uncolonised western parts of Van Diemen's Land.

    "Defunct federal electoral district of Mexico\nThe sixth federal electoral district of Durango (Distrito electoral federal 06 de Durango) is a defunct Mexican electoral district. During its most recent existence, it returned one deputy to the Chamber of Deputies for each three-year legislative period by means of the first-past-the-post system. Votes cast in the district also counted towards the calculation of proportional representation (\"plurinominal\") deputies elected from the country's electoral regions.\nThe original sixth district of Durango was dissolved in 1930.\nIt was re-established as part of the 1977 electoral reforms, which increased the number of single-member seats in the Chamber of Deputies from 196 to 300, with Durango's seat allocation rising from four to six. \nIt was dissolved again in the 1996 redistricting process, when the state's population no longer warranted six districts.\nThe restored sixth district was therefore first contested in the 1979 mid-terms and elected its last deputy in the 1994 general election.\nDistrict territory\nDuring its 1977\u20131996 existence, the sixth district covered the municipalities of El Oro, Hidalgo, Ind\u00e9, Lerdo, Mapim\u00ed, Nazas, Ocampo, San Luis del Cordero and San Pedro del Gallo. Its head town (cabecera distrital), where results from individual polling stations were gathered together and collated, was at the city of Lerdo.\nDeputies returned to Congress\nNotes\n^ An amendment to Article 52 of the Constitution in 1928 changed the original provision of \"one deputy per 60,000 inhabitants\" to \"one deputy per 100,000\"; as a result, the size of the Chamber of Deputies fell from 281 in the 1928 election to 171 in 1934.\nReferences\n^ \"How Mexico Elects Its Leaders \u2014 The Rules\".

    "Species of lichen\nOxneriaria pakistanica is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichen in the family Megasporaceae. The species was described in 2023 by Muhammad Shahid Iqbal, Muhammad Usman, Kamran Habib, and Abdul Nasir Khalid. The specific epithet pakistanica refers to Pakistan, the country where it was discovered. Molecular phylogenetics analysis of internal transcribed spacer sequences placed O.\u00a0pakistanica as sister to O.\u00a0rivulicola, though it is morphologically distinct.\nDescription\nOxneriaria pakistanica has a crustose, non-zonate thallus that is initially placodoid (lobate) but becomes non-placodoid with age, reaching up to 5 cm across. The areoles are distinctly developed, uncracked, 0.5\u20131.8 mm wide, and broadly attached to the substrate. The upper surface is dull and epruinose, and whitish grey to greyish in colour. No prothallus is present.\nThe apothecia (fruiting bodies) are frequent, aspicilioid, and immersed in the thallus. They measure 0.5\u20132\u00a0mm in diameter and have a black, dull disc. The hymenium is 100\u2013155\u00a0\u03bcm tall and the hypothecium is 90\u2013170\u00a0\u03bcm deep. Ascospores are simple, hyaline, broadly ellipsoid to sub-spherical, and measure 10\u201318 by 7\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm.\nHabitat and distribution\nOxneriaria pakistanica is known only to occur in its type locality in the Darel Valley of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It was found growing on calcareous sedimentary rocks in a moist temperate climate at elevations around 1,900\u20132,000\u00a0m (6,200\u20136,600\u00a0ft). It is one of six Oxneriaria species known to occur in Pakistan; the others are O.\u00a0crittendenii, O.\u00a0iqbalii, O.\u00a0kohistaniensis, and O.\u00a0pruinosa.\nReferences\n^ a b c d Iqbal, Muhammad Shahid; Usman, Muhammad; Habib, Kamran; Khalid, Abdul Nasir (2023). \"Oxneriaria pakistanica sp. nov.

    "1997 United States Supreme Court case\nSuitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 520 U.S. 725 (1997), is a United States Supreme Court case pertaining to the regulatory authority of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) and its impact on private property rights. Bernadine Suitum owned a parcel of land near Lake Tahoe, which she intended to develop. However, the TRPA imposed stringent regulations to protect the environment of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Under these regulations, Suitum was denied the permit to develop her property because it was classified as unsuitable for development based on the environmental criteria. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine the ripeness of Suitum's claim. The Court concluded that Suitum's takings claim was ripe for adjudication, emphasizing that Suitum was not required to attempt to sell her TDRs before her claim could be considered ripe. The Court based its reasoning on the immediate and direct impact of the regulatory action on her property rights, deeming further administrative actions unnecessary.\nBackground\nBernadine Suitum owned an 18,300-square-foot parcel of land in Incline Village, Nevada, near the shore of Lake Tahoe. When she purchased the property in 1972, it was zoned for residential development. In 1980, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), which regulates development in the Lake Tahoe Basin, adopted a plan prohibiting any development that exceeded \"environmental threshold carrying capacity\". In 1987, the Agency adopted an Individual Parcel Evaluation System (IPES) \u201cto rate the suitability of vacant residential parcels for building and other modification.\"\nThe IPES also established \"Stream Environment Zones (SEZs), which generally collect surface water from upland areas and direct it into Lake Tahoe and its tributaries.\" To be eligible for construction, a property must achieve a minimum score in the IPES system. However, undeveloped land located in the Stream Environment Zones (SEZs) normatively received an IPES score of zero and was therefore deemed unsuitable for construction. Therefore, as a form of recompense for the infringement of the developmental rights of property owners, the TRPA provides property owners with Transferable Development Rights (TDRs). These TDRs, with the agency's approval, enable property owners to vend their development rights to proprietors of other parcels.\nWhen Suitum applied to the agency for permission to construct a house on her lot, the agency determined that her property was located within a SEZ, assigned it an IPES score of zero, and denied permission to build. Suitum appealed the denial to the agency's governing board, which also denied relief. Suitum, however, did not seek to exercise the rights of the transferable development rights (TDRs) provided to her by the Agency, but filed a complaint for just compensation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that the TRPA's decision constituted a \"taking\" of her property.\nThe District Court determined that Suitum's claim was not ripe for adjudication due to her failure to attempt to sell her TDRs, which made it impossible to determine their specific values. As a result, the court concluded that it could not realistically assess whether the agency's regulations had impeded Suitum's reasonable expectations. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals supported this rationale and upheld the decision, asserting that the agency's action on a TDR transfer application would constitute the necessary \"final decision\" regarding the regulation's application to Suitum's property.\nArguments of the petitioner\nSuitum argued that the Agency's restrictions deprived her of \u201call reasonable and economically viable use\u201d of her property, constituting a taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Additionally, Suitum argued that any attempt to transfer her Transfer of Development Rights (TDRs) would be an \u201cidle and futile act\u201d because the TDR program was a \"sham.\"\nArguments of the respondent\nTRPA argued that Suitum's claim was not suitable for adjudication under the \"fitness for review\" standard established in Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner. The argument maintained that Suitum's takings claim was unfit for adjudication due to the absence of a final agency decision regarding the permissible extent of development on her land.\nTRPA maintained that Suitum had not pursued the available mechanisms to obtain or transfer her TDRs, concluding that she had not exhausted all administrative remedies before filing the lawsuit.\nHolding\nThe United States Supreme Court ruled that the TRPA's determination regarding Suitum's property development eligibility constituted a final agency decision, thus rendering her claim ripe for adjudication. The Court's decision reversed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal's affirmation of the District Court of Nevada's ruling against Suitum. The Court dismissed the lower court's assertion that a final decision on Suitum's land was pe",
    "The Woytinsky-Tarnow-Baade plan, abbreviated as the WTB plan, was a proposed debt-financed public employment program in Germany in 1932. It was intended to ease the effects of the Great Depression by ending the country's deflationary spiral and increase purchasing power. The plan would have seen the federal government fund one million public jobs via a loan from the German Central Bank of three billion Reichsmark (equivalent to 3% of GDP).\nThe plan was named for its three key proponents: Russian economist Vladimir S. Voitinsky (in German Woytinsky), woodworkers' union president Fritz Tarnow, and Social Democratic agriculture spokesman Fritz Baade. The three presented their plan to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and German Trade Union Confederation in January 1932, but it was not adopted.\nBackground\nWoytinsky was a Russian economist and politician who had emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1921. He spent most of the 1920s in Germany, where he published a series of statistical economics books, The World in Figures. In the latter part of the decade he contributed to the Social Democratic theoretical journal Die Gesellschaft, through which he was hired by the General German Trade Union Federation (ADGB) as head of statistics and economic advisor.\nAfter the onset of the depression, the government of Heinrich Br\u00fcning implemented a harsh austerity programme involving reductions in wages, welfare, and public expenditure, combined with tax increases. These policies were implemented via emergency decree and proved deeply unpopular. Contrary to Br\u00fcning's intentions, they also had the effect of worsening the depression, reducing growth and increasing unemployment.\nWoytinsky identified deflation and the resultant lack of spending in the economy as a chief cause of the worsening economic situation and mass unemployment. During the years of 1931 and 1932 Germany was experiencing a 10% annual rate of deflation. In early 1931 Woytinsky began developing a preliminary version of what would become the WTB plan, proposing the injection of money into the European economy via large-scale public works on an international scale.:\u200a159\u200a He was supported by the ADGB and began publishing articles advocating his ideas in the union theoretical journal Die Arbeit in June 1931, opening debate over the concept of \"active economic policy\".\nToward the end of the year, Woytinsky had narrowed the scope of his proposals to a domestic scheme financed by bank loans. He continued to refine the plan and its theoretical basis. Previous opponents in the union movement including Fritz Tarnow were converted, and the two began to collaborate in promoting active economic policy to combat the depression. Along with Fritz Baade, the three presented their plan to a joint meeting of the SPD and ADGB boards.:\u200a162\u200a\nReception\nThe plan had widespread appeal among the union movement and the lower levels of the Social Democratic Party, who were desperate for a strategy to reduce unemployment. Six million workers were unemployed during 1932 and as a result were facing destitution, exacerbated by cuts to unemployment benefits and social welfare. Woytinsky's work in Die Arbeit had sparked wide debate over active economic policy in the party and the unions, and some aspects garnered widespread support.:\u200a164\u2013165\u200a\nWhile Woytinsky had won over the bulk of the union movement by the end of 1931, most Social Democratic leaders were skeptical. Rudolf Hilferding, the party's widely respected chief theoretician and economist, opposed Woytinsky's ideas throughout their development and promotion. Hilferding adhered to the economic orthodoxy of the time. He believed that the periodic crises of capitalism were unavoidable and that state intervention could do little if anything to facilitate recovery. Fear of inflation was also widespread after Germany's experience with hyperinflation in the early 1920s: Hilferding believed that the inflationary impact of debt financing would erase any positive effects.:\u200a164\u200a Moreover, many socialists were disturbed by the idea of attempting to \"rescue\" capitalism from a crisis of its own making. Fritz Tarnow, though a supporter of the plan, articulated this dilemma:\nNow, however, we stand at the sickbed of capitalism not only as diagnosticians, but also \u2013 yes, what can I say? \u2013 as a doctor who wants to heal? Or as a cheerful heir who can't wait for the end and would prefer to help things along with poison? This double role, doctor and heir, is a damn difficult task.\nThese arguments proved persuasive for large parts of the party. Social Democratic leaders also viewed the plan as an intrusion into the sphere of policymaking, which traditionally lay with the party, not the unions. Considering these factors, and with Hilferding staunchly opposed, the SPD board rejected the WTB plan in January 1932. The ADGB reluctantly followed their lead, declining the endorse the plan, but continued to call for large-scale public works and against defla",

    "Portuguese breed of dog\nDog breed\nThe C\u00e3o do Barrocal Algarvio or Barrocal Algarvio is Portuguese breed of warren hound. It originates in the Algarve region of southern Portugal, and is named for the Barrocal\u00a0 sub-region thereof. It was recognised by the Clube Portugu\u00eas de Canicultura in 2015 and by the Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral de Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e Veterin\u00e1ria of Portugal in 2016. It is not recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale. No working trial is required for registration.\nHistory\nThe C\u00e3o do Barrocal Algarvio is a traditional warren hound of the Algarve region in general and of the Barrocal\u00a0 sub-region in particular. It was formerly numerous in that area: in the mid-twentieth century there were some 3500 of the dogs, but numbers fell sharply in the later part of the century and by the 1960s there were fewer than 50 remaining; the population was thought to be at risk of extinction. A breed society, the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Criadores do C\u00e3o do Barrocal Algarvio, was formed either in 2004:\u200a241\u200a or in 2006. A molecular genetic study of the dogs was begun in 2012 by the Instituto Nacional de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Veterin\u00e1ria;:\u200a241\u200a preliminary results found an index of genetic diversity comparable to that in other Portuguese breeds.:\u200a53\u200a\nThe Barrocal Algarvio was recognised by the Clube Portugu\u00eas de Canicultura in 2015, and received official recognition from the Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral de Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e Veterin\u00e1ria as an autochthonous dog breed originating in Portugal in 2016. It is not recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.\nA single-breed dog show was held in Faro in September 2022, and again in September 2023.\nCharacteristics\nThe C\u00e3o do Barrocal Algarvio is of medium size, and is roughly square in outline. Height at the withers is in the range 52\u201358\u00a0cm for dogs and about 3\u00a0cm less for bitches, with a tolerance of \u00b12\u00a0cm in each case; weights are about 20\u201325\u00a0kg for dogs and some 5\u00a0kg less for bitches.\nThe coat is thick and smooth, with no undercoat. It is most often brown, yellow, grey, black or fawn, either patched, solid, or patched with white; tricoloured and other varied coats also acceptable.\nNo working trial is required for registration.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f Barbado da Terceira (in Portuguese).

    "Chinese author and calligrapher\nLi Zhengzhong (Chinese: \u674e\u6b63\u4e2d; 16 April, 1921 - February 23, 2020), sometimes known by his pen names Ke Ju and Wei Changming was a Chinese author, calligrapher, novelist based in Manchukuo. Li was married to fellow author Zhang Xingjuan, together they were considered one of the \"Northeast\u2019s four famous husband-wife writers\".\nEarly life in Manchukuo\nLi Zhengzhong was born on 16 April, 1921, in Yitong County, Jilin. From a young age, his mother encouraged him to recite Tang Dynasty poetry. He attended Jilin City No.1 Middle School. At the age of sixteen he published his first collection of writings, Yu Yin guan shi cun (Yu Yin Pavilion Poems), which is considered to be a lost literary work. Some poems from the text were recovered through local newspapers published in Manchukuo. He then attended Datong University (now Utopia University) in Shanghai from 1939 to 1941, earning a law degree. Li published two more poetry collections, Native Place Yearning and Qiyue (July), both written during his time at university. By 1945, Li published four more books; Wuxian zhi sheng wuxian zhi l\u00fc (Unlimited Life, Unlimited Travel), Sun (Bamboo), Chuntian yi zhu cao (A Blade of Spring Grass), and Lu huo (Furnace Fire). A second edition of Qiyue was published in 1946. While in Manchukuo, Li worked as a judge in a Chinese court and pursued writing, editing, and calligraphy.\nLater career\nAfter World War II, Li worked as a newspaper editor for Dongbei wenxue (Northeast Literature) and Guangfu ribao (Recovery Daily). The new Communist government sentenced Li to six months in prison for his Manchukuo career. After being released he joined the People's Liberation Army and had stopped writing in 1955. During the 1950s and 1960s he worked various positions at a factory in Shenyang, including as a teacher and a labor organizer. Li was condemned as an anti-revolutionary by a court in 1969, and was exiled to rural Liaoning alongside his wife, three children, and father.\nThe Chinese Communist Party reversed it's ruling on writers in 1978 and Li's family returned to Shenyang the following year. Li's calligraphy was exhibitioned across China and in Canada, England, and Taiwan.\nPersonal life\nHe met his future wife Zhang Xingjuan at the age of 14. The two later married in 1943 and had three children.\nLi died on February 23, 2020. His final wish was to donate a total of 500 rare books and pictures to Jilin City No.1 Middle School, which was fulfilled by his family in 2021.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l Culver, Annika A.; Smith, Norman (2019-12-09).

    "Military engineer (1704\u20131773)\nPortrait of Jacob von Eggers by Jacob Wessel\u00a0\nJacob von Eggers (before 1772 Jacob Eggers; 14 December 1704 \u2013 12 January 1773) was a military engineer and Swedish friherre (baron). He was born in a German-speaking family in present-day Tartu, then known as Dorpat, in Russian-occupied Swedish Livonia, during the Great Northern War. Around the age of four he was deported together with his mother to Russia, where in 1713 she remarried a Swedish baron. After the war, the family moved to Sweden where Jacob pursued studies in fortification. He became an officer in the Swedish military in 1729. Following his stepfather's death in 1733, he sought opportunities to further his career abroad as well as in Sweden. In 1734 he accompanied the troops of Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski during the War of the Polish Succession and participated in the siege of Danzig (modern-day Gda\u0144sk). He then spent some time as a volunteer in imperial, Saxon and French service, as well as making study trips around Europe. From 1737 he formed a more lasting link with the Electorate of Saxony, and was formally employed both by the Swedish and Saxon militaries until 1758.\nHe participated in several campaigns during these years, and wrote an appreciated account of the French siege and capture of Bergen op Zoom in 1747. He went on to further edit and expand a French military dictionary, and provide an influential and expanded German translation of the same work. He was furthermore entrusted with the military education of the Saxon princes Charles and Xavier. He was promoted in both Swedish and Saxon service, ending the latter with the rank of major general in 1757. In Sweden, he was elevated to the rank of friherre or baron, awarded the Order of the Sword and elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1757 he however left both Swedish and Saxon service and settled in Gda\u0144sk, where he would spend the rest of his life as commander of the city's fortifications. He kept in contact with the Swedish academy, and donated his extensive library to it. He died in 1773.\nBiography\nEarly life\nJacob von Eggers was born in present-day Tartu, then known as Dorpat, in the middle of the Great Northern War. The city was then part of Swedish Livonia, but just a few months before his birth the city had surrendered, after a long siege, to Russian troops and thus came under Russian occupation. He came from a Baltic German family; his father was a baker originally from Holstein, and was killed in an armed robbery before the birth of Jacob. His mother, n\u00e9e Sophia Margaretha Kr\u00fcger, was the daughter an alderman in the guild of bakers in Tartu. Around the age of four Jacob and his mother, together with the entire German-speaking population of Tartu, were deported to Arkhangelsk. He attended a school set up for deported Swedish citizens in Archangelsk by pietist Swedish officers. Subsequently, Jacob and his mother was moved between different localities in Russia. While in Veliky Ustyug n 1713, his mother remarried a Swedish officer in Russian captivity, friherre (baron) Captain Knut Gustaf Sparre\u00a0, who thus became Jacob's stepfather. Jacob could pursue further studies among the captive Swedish officers in Veliky Ustyug, who taught him Latin, French, Italian, mathematics and music, though he would later describe his studies in these subjects as haphazard. He also learnt Russian in captivity,\nJacob's stepfather Knut Gustaf Sparre\u00a0. Portrait by Johan Henrik Scheffel.\nFollowing the Peace of Nystad in 1721, Jacob followed his mother and stepfather to Sweden, where Jacob soon began studies in fortification. He spent a few years in the Royal Swedish Regiment in France, in order to widen his knowledge abroad, and made a study trip to the Dutch Republic to see the fortifications of Menno van Coehoorn. After his return to Sweden in 1729 he became an officer in the Swedish military, in the predecessor of today's Swedish Fortifications Agency, and worked at the construction of the fortification of Fredriksborgs f\u00e4stning\u00a0 outside Stockholm.\nAn itinerant career\nJacob von Eggers' stepfather died in 1733, and in 1734 Jacob left Sweden and enrolled with the troops of Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski, who was attempting to regain the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the ensuing War of the Polish Succession, Jacob was Eggers fought on the side of Leszczy\u0144ski, was promoted to the rank of captain, and participated in the siege of Danzig (modern-day Gda\u0144sk). Following the failed campaign, he was commissioned by the King Frederick I of Sweden, who was equally Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, to inspect and improve the fortifications of Rheinfels Castle. He then spent two years accompanying the Swedish Count Adam Horn af Ekebyholm\u00a0 on travels to Vienna and Venice, after which he in 1737 spent time as a volunteer in imperial service, fighting in Hungary and Serbia during the Austrian campaign against the Ottoman Empire with field marshal Friedrich Heinrich v",
    "Federal electoral district of Mexico\nFederal electoral districts of Oaxaca since 2022\nOaxaca under the 2017\u20132022 districting plan\nThe eighth federal electoral district of Oaxaca (Distrito electoral federal 08 de Oaxaca) is one of the 300 electoral districts into which Mexico is divided for elections to the federal Chamber of Deputies and one of 10 such districts in the state of Oaxaca.\nIt elects one deputy to the lower house of Congress for each three-year legislative period by means of the first-past-the-post system. Votes cast in the district also count towards the calculation of proportional representation (\"plurinominal\") deputies elected from the third region.\nDistrict territory\nUnder the 2022 districting plan, which is to be used for the 2024, 2027 and 2030 federal elections, the eighth district covers eight municipalities in the central part of the state.\nThe district's head town (cabecera distrital), where results from individual polling stations are gathered together and collated, is the state capital, the city of Oaxaca de Ju\u00e1rez.\nWith Indigenous and Afrodescendent inhabitants accounting for over 43% of its population, it is classified by the National Electoral Institute (INE) as an indigenous district.\nPrevious districting schemes\n2017\u20132022\nOaxaca's 11th district was dissolved in the 2017 redistricting process. Under the 2017 to 2022 scheme, \nthe eighth district had its head town at the city of Oaxaca and it covered seven municipalities.\n2005\u20132017\nBetween 2005 and 2017, the eighth district's head town was at the city of Oaxaca and it comprised four municipalities.\n1996\u20132005\nBetween 1996 and 2017, Oaxaca's seat allocation was increased to 11. Under the 1996 districting plan, the head town was moved to the city of Oaxaca.\n1978\u20131996\nThe districting scheme in force from 1978 to 1996 was the result of the 1977 electoral reforms, which increased the number of single-member seats in the Chamber of Deputies from 196 to 300. Under that plan, Oaxaca's seat allocation rose from nine to ten. The eighth district had its head town at Santiago Pinotepa Nacional in the state's Costa Chica region.\nDeputies returned to Congress\nNotes\n^ Oaxaca accounts for 3.3% of the country's population and 4.8% of its surface area, but it contains almost a quarter of its municipalities: 570 out of 2,446.\n^ Mart\u00ednez Neri sat as an independent after 2 July 2018.\nReferences\n^ \"How Mexico Elects Its Leaders \u2014 The Rules\".

    "Mountain in Colorado, United States\nLong Branch Baldy is a mountain in the Cochetopa Hills of the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. The 11,980-foot (3,652\u00a0m) mountain is located in Saguache County, Colorado and on the Continental Divide, which here forms the border between Gunnison National Forest and Rio Grande National Forest.\nGeology\nLong Branch Baldy is located within the San Juan volcanic field and the region is dominated by Tertiary volcanic rocks, including lavas, ash flow tuffs, and breccias. The mountain itself is composed of andesite of the Conejos Formation, deposited by andesitic stratovolcanoes 33 to 29 million years ago. Small scabs of dacite from the Bonanza eruptions (33 million years ago) are present near the summit and on the northern slope of the mountain.\nLong Branch Baldy was glaciated, and glacial cirques are located on the northeast and east sides of the mountain where tarns and glacial deposits are found.\nClimate\nLong Branch Baldy's climate is classified as a subarctic climate (Dfc) in the K\u00f6ppen system, with cold, snowy winters and cool summers. It receives precipitation as snow in winter and as thunderstorms in summer, with June typically being a drier month.\nHiking\nHiking to the summit of Long Branch Baldy is typically done during the summer and early fall when snow is free of the roads used to reach the trailheads. A common route to the summit starts at the Long Branch Trailhead located at the end of Forest Road 780, 4.6 miles (7.4\u00a0km) south of the town of Sargents. A hike along the Baldy Lake Trail (Forest Trail 491) leads to the Continental Divide Trail (CDT). From there, a short hike west along the CDT to the mountain's south ridge allows for an off-trail, class 2 ridge hike leading north to the summit. This 7.2-mile (11.6\u00a0km) route (one-way) has an elevation gain of 3,400 feet (1,036\u00a0m).\nLong Branch Baldy can also be reached from four-wheel-drive roads and trails to the west, south, and east. The shortest of these hikes begins at the Razor Creek Trailhead. From here the CDT can be followed northeast to the southwest ridge of the mountain, which can then be hiked to the summit. This 4.4-mile (7.1\u00a0km) route (one-way) has an elevation gain of 1,600 feet (488\u00a0m).\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Long Branch Baldy CO\". listsofjohn.com.

    "Mountain in Montana, United States\nSheep Mountain is a 10,097-foot (3,078-metre) mountain summit in Park County, Montana, United States.\nDescription\nSheep Mountain is located 39 miles (63\u00a0km) south of Bozeman in the Gallatin Range, which is a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. It is set on the common boundary shared by Yellowstone National Park and the Gallatin National Forest. The mountain is also within the Gallatin Petrified Forest which is one of the largest petrified forests of the Eocene Epoch. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's north slope drains to the Yellowstone River via Tom Miner Creek, whereas the south slope drains to Specimen Creek which is a tributary of the nearby Gallatin River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises approximately 1,800 feet (549 meters) above headwaters of North Fork Specimen Creek in one mile (1.6\u00a0km). The approach to the remote summit is made from the Sky Rim Trail and Gallatin Skyline Trail. There is a microwave reflector stationed at the summit. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. This peak should not be confused with the other Sheep Mountain also in Park County, Montana, but in the Absaroka Range.\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Sheep Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F.\nSee also\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains\nGallery\nSheep Mountain viewed from Sky Rim Trail\nNortheast aspect of Sheep Mountain rises above Sawtooth Mountain\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Sheep Mountain, Montana\".

    "Residential skyscraper in Manhattan, New York\nARO is a rental luxury apartment skyscraper in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. It is located on 242 West 53rd Street, the former site of the Roseland Ballroom. It was designed by CetraRuddy. Construction began in 2015 and was completed in 2018; it started leasing in October 2018.\nHistory\nThe Roseland Ballroom in 2007\nARO stands at the former site of the Roseland Ballroom. In November 2013, it was announced that the ballroom would be replaced with a ~50-story tower designed by CetraRuddy. The first renderings of ARO were published in January 2014, when it was reported that the building would be 59 stories. Modified versions of the renderings were released in July 2017, alongside the \"ARO\" name. The name combines the first letter of former Roseland owner Albert Ginsberg's name with the first two letters in \"Roseland\".\nThe ballroom was razed starting in August 2014, and demolition was completed in 2015. Algin Management began developing ARO later that year. DeSimone Consulting Engineers worked on the building's structural supports. The building's foundation was constructed in the summer of 2016. By November 2016, construction had reached a height of 12 stories. The building topped out in 2017. Triumph Property Group started leasing one- to three-bedroom apartments in the building in October 2018; at the time, rent prices ranged from $2,900 to $17,500 a month.\nArchitecture\nARO is a 62-story, 700-foot-tall (210\u00a0m) glass tower with a steel lattice exterior. The building's massing, or shape, changes on the upper levels to give each apartment the best lighting and view. To do this, the architects purchased development and air rights from the surrounding low-rise theaters. It has 426 luxury rental apartments, as well as amenities. Retail stores are at ground level, and parking is available underground. Each apartment covers an average of 1,024 square feet (95.1\u00a0m2). The apartment models range from one to four bedrooms. Each apartment has a 10-foot-tall (3.0\u00a0m) ceiling and floor-to-ceiling windows. It has oak floors, but marble floors in the bathroom. The walls are tiled marble. Some apartments have balconies.\nARO's lobby includes a sculpture, which spells out ARO using letters from the \"ROSELAND\" sign on the ballroom's 53rd Street side. The sculpture's creator, James Greco, worked as a bartender at the ballroom. Various items related to the ballroom, including concert posters, decorate the lobby. The ARO Club is one of the building's amenity spaces, and is made up of three lounges, which include many sporting and athletic facilities; these are located next to ARO's fitness center. Another amenity space is the ARO Sky Club at the top of the building, which includes a residential rooftop lounge with a glass ceiling.\nReception\nThe building won numerous architectural prizes, such as the 2015 SARA National Award, the 2017 American Architecture Prize, the 2017 Architecture Podium International Award, and a 2018 Architecture, Construction & Design Award.\nReferences\n^ a b c d Plitt, Amy (February 5, 2018). \"Roseland Ballroom-replacing Midtown skyscraper now looks like its renderings\".

    "Island in Gujarat, India\nKhadir Bet is an island located in the Great Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, India. It spans around 200 square kilometers. It is known for its archaeological significance, particularly as the site of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization city of Dholavira, also a UNESCO world heritage site.\nThe term \"Khadir\" is derived from the Kutchi word \"Khad\", which translates to \"grass\". In 2022, a new 24.5 km road connecting Khadir Bet to Bhachau Taluka was sanctioned by the government, reducing travel distance and improving accessibility to the Dholavira World Heritage Site.\nGeography\nIt lies in the Great Rann of Kutch, approximately 5 kilometers from the mainland. Khadir Bet is triangular, with sharp cliffs on its northern edge rising up to 125 meters, while the southern part slopes gently into the surrounding salt flats. The southern part slopes gently into the surrounding salt flats. The geology of Khadir Island consists mainly of sandstones, claystone, and fossiliferous limestone, with cultivable soil in some areas.\nIn July 2023, researchers from the Gujarat Ecological Education and Research Foundation (GEERF) documented the presence of Salsola oppositifolia, a halophytic (salt-tolerant) shrub typically found around the Mediterranean Sea, including regions of Italy and Northern Africa, for the first time in India at Khadir Bet.\nArchaeology\nDholavira, located on Khadir Island, is one of the largest Harappan sites in India, dating from around 2650 to 1450 BCE.\nKhadir Bet is best known for its connection to Dholavira, an ancient city of the Indus Valley Civilization. The Harappans extracted over three million cubic meters of earth and rock from the island, which were used in construction, pottery, and artifact production for both local use and export.\nApart from Dholavira, several other archaeological sites have been identified on Khadir Bet. One notable site is Jhandiasar, located about 2 kilometers north of Dholavira, near a seasonal rivulet. This site reveals remnants of stone structures, such as walls and square formations, indicating it might have functioned as a harbor or logistical base for transporting materials to Dholavira. Another site, Bambhanka, located about 15 kilometers south of Dholavira, situated on a high tableland near a seasonal stream that flows into the sea.\nGallery\nDholavira, Khadir Bet\nFruit vendors\nA bird\nSee also\nGreat Rann of Kutch\nMeruda Takkar\nKutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary\nReferences\n^ \"Dholavira: The lost-found civilisation\".

    "\nDump truck rocket artillery is a term used to refer to rocket artillery, generally in the form of an MLRS, built inside of a civilian dump truck. This type of vehicle has seen use in many conflicts around the Middle East, such as the Iraq War and the Syrian Civil War, along with ongoing conflicts between Israel and various militant groups.\nOperational history\nOn February 3, 2022, a Turkish military base near Bashiqa, Iraq, came under fire from rocket artillery. It was later revealed that the rockets were launched by a Kurdish militant group known as Ahrar Sinjar using rocket artillery hidden inside civilian dump trucks.\nIn 2010, the Israeli army captured a rocket truck disguised as a garbage dump truck in the Gaza Strip area. The specific vehicle in use was a 4x2 Toyota Dyna model 150. It had nine rocket tubes. The rockets were rotation-stabilized, likely Chinese Type 63 rockets.\nISIS militants in Syria are known to operate at least one Hyundai Mighty dump truck converted to an MLRS.\nDuring a military parade on September 8, 2023, the North Korean military showcased a number of rocket and missile systems disguised as civilian vehicles. Among those shown were Sinotruk HOWO 371 dump trucks with 12 hidden rocket launch tubes, each capable of firing 122mm rockets. Their official North Korean military designations are unknown.\nReferences\n^ office_zzam (2022-02-04). \"Turkish base in Iraq under fire from MLRS hidden in civilian dump truc\". armyrecognition.com.

    "Russian serial killer and rapist\nFor the artist, see Alexander Lobanov.\nAlexander Leonidovich Lobanov (1979 \u2013 March 6, 2002), known as The Motovilikha Maniac (Russian: \u041c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0445\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a), was a Russian serial killer and rapist who raped and murdered five girls and women in Perm's Motovilikhinsky City District from 1999 to 2001. Convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the crimes, Lobanov committed suicide in a detention center while awaiting for his sentence to be officially confirmed.\nEarly life\nAlexander Leonidovich Lobanov was born in Perm in 1979, the second of two children. He grew up in an average family, with his dad being a teacher and his mother looking after the children, and displayed no deviant or violent behavior while growing up. This all changed in 1996, when his mother passed away from a brain tumor, with the trauma from this event leading to Lobanov developing emotional issues.\nA year later, he was drafted into the Russian Ground Forces and dispatched for military duty in Sakhalin. It is suspected that Lobanov suffered some sort of abuse at the hands of other soldiers, but as he refused to talk about his time there, this remains speculative. After completing his service, Lobanov returned to Perm, where he started behaving aggressively towards others and became very withdrawn. His father also noticed that he started exhibiting odd behavior, with one particular instance being him posing with two fellow soldiers brandishing an axe and staring into the camera. Around this time, he made several attempts to approach women, but was rejected each time and was even beaten up by the women's boyfriends if he pestered them. Subsequently, Lobanov became a misogynist and decided to start committing murders.\nMurders\nLobanov's modus operandi consisted of seeking out pretty young girls and women in the Motovilikhinsky City District and approaching them to talk, often at night. If he perceived that the victim slighted him in any way, he would lure or force her into a crowded area (or, in the case of the last two victims, into his apartment), where he would attack. During the murders, he demonstrated a tendency for sadism: he inflicted a large number of injuries on the victims; intentionally prolonged their suffering by inflicting superficial and non-fatal wounds; mutilated their faces and raped them.\nThe first murder occurred on October 4, 1999, when he met a 32-year-old woman in a courtyard on Raboche-Krestyanskaya Street and drank some beer with her. At some point, she suggested that Lobanov beat up two men in her apartment, but he refused, after which the woman began to make rude remarks about him. Enraged, Lobanov hit her several times with his fists and a glass bottle, then dragged her into a garage where he raped her, cut her carotid artery and severed her jugular vein with the broken bottle shards. He then beat her up one last time and left her to bleed to death.\nThe next crime occurred on October 11, not far from the first crime scene. Using the same method, Lobanov met up with a 23-year-old woman on Chernyshevsky Street and offered to accompany her on a walk. After some time, he invited her to visit his apartment, but she refused. After this, Lobanov lured her to the Iskra Cinema, where he raped, beat and strangled her to death with a belt.\nOn the night of March 2, 2000, Lobanov was on a tram riding through Gagarin Boulevard when he noticed an 18-year-old girl getting off on the Vagonoremontny Zavod stop. He followed her and invited her out, but she refused to talk with him. In response, Lobanov pulled out a scalpel he was carrying with him and put it up to the young woman's throat, before forcing her to the nearby garages, where he started hitting her with both his fists and the scalpel, inflicting a total of 97 stab wounds on the victim's body.\nOn December 17, Lobanov invited a 19-year-old girl he had met at the Sadovy mini-market into his apartment where, after drinking alcohol together, he propositioned to have sex with her. The girl rejected him, and then started insulting and humiliating him, even cutting his hand with a razor. Lobanov went to the bathroom, washed off the blood and, taking a cast-iron bucket from the sink, returned to the victim and hit her approximately 45 times with it. He then cut her throat so deep that he reached the cervical vertebrae, and raped the woman's corpse. After finishing, he placed it in a bag and discarded it in a trash can near his apartment before covering up the bloodstains on the walls with a carpet and some pictures. Shortly after this murder, Lobanov suffered a breakdown and realized that he was a danger to others, and immediately decided to apply for treatment at a psychiatric hospital.\nAfter spending some time in the hospital, Lobanov was released and returned to his home. On June 5, 2001, he invited 25-year-old Anna K. to his apartment to drink alcohol together, during which the woman started making cynical remarks about him. Lobanov then",

    "Lebanese entrepreneur and investor\nCharles Corm II (born January 31, 1974) is a Lebanese investor who serves as Managing Partner of CCORMCO LLC (referred to as CORMCO), a private investment company he founded in 1998 and focused on public and private companies in the global tech, biotech, and real estate industries. From 1998 to 2005, CORMCO invested in a string of high-profile IPOs, such as Broadcom in 1998 and Nvidia in 1999, these two companies now being, more than 25 years later, among the 10 most valuable technology companies in the world. Charles is also a Board Member of the Charles Corm Foundation, a non-profit foundation guided to by the humanist vision of writer and industrialist Charles Corm, founded to promote and support Lebanon's cultural and natural heritage in partnership with Saint-Joseph University of Beirut.\nEarly life\nCharles was born on January 31, 1974, in Beirut, Lebanon. His mother, Maya Shahid, is a Lebanese painter and his father, David, is a Lebanese architect and businessman. He is the grandson of Lebanese writer and industrialist Charles Corm. His great-grandfather is Lebanese painter Daoud Corm.\nIn 1975, when the Lebanese Civil War erupted, his parents sought refuge in Paris, where Charles grew up and attended school at Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague, a highly selective Jesuit school. He later attended Paris Dauphine University, from which he graduated in 1996 with an MSG in economics, management, and finance.\nCharles then earned, in 2003, an M.B.A from Columbia Business School in New York City, where he lived seven years before returning to Beirut, Lebanon in 2003.\nCareer\nCharles started his career in 1997 as a hedge fund analyst, covering US technology and biotechnology stocks on Wall Street. In 1998, he quit his job to found CORMCO.\nThrough CORMCO, Charles invested in a string of high-profile IPOs, such as Broadcom in 1998 and Nvidia in 1999, these two companies now being, more than 20 years later, among the 10 most valuable technology companies in the world. Other notable investments include Emaar Properties in 2000 (IPO), Qualcomm in 2003, and Biogen in 2005. CORMCO was an early proponent of patient capital, whereas an investor is willing to forgo an immediate return in anticipation of more substantial returns down the road. This strategy helped CORMCO achieve superior investment returns from its inception in 1998 throughout 2024.\nPersonal life\nCharles now lives in Beirut, Lebanon. He is married to Lynn Dagher. They have two children, Carma and David. Charles is also, in his free time, an exhibited digital designer.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR). \"sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar/cormco_llc\". www.sec.gov.

The group is effectively the Syrian regime's main control of Aleppo.\nHistory\nThe group was established on February 27, 2017, after the Aleppo Defenders Legion brought together many of the local militias with support from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps with its formation occurring near the time where regime sponsored militias took control of Aleppo's eastern city and neighborhoods. This group serves as an umbrella organization which emerged during the first quarter of 2017 as the regime expanded against the Islamic State in east Aleppo. The groups backing and purpose is to also deepen Iran's ties with Aleppo and it's region. As a governing body and militant group, the Aleppo Defenders Legion has participated and held meetings with the Aleppo sector of the Syrian Ba'ath party, Liwa al-Baqir, and Liwa al-Quds. The armed battalions of the Aleppo Defenders Legion include Fawj al-Safira, Fawj Hadher, and Fawj Azan with the ruling commander of all of them, including the group itself, Aleppo Defenders Legion, being Saber Rameen after succeeding Javad Ghaffari in 2021.\nIn the areas of Aleppo and Syrian Democratic Forces territory, the Aleppo Defenders Legion is one of the primary traffickers of narcotics through those areas, specifically, Manbij, Tell Rifaat, and the Aleppo countryside adjacent to Afrin.\nThe Aleppo Defenders Legion has the city of Aleppo primarily divided into four sectors known as squares, the second square is considered to be the most influential which is located in the central district of al-Telfon al-Hawaei. These squares are basically the governing bodies of the cities sectors which further exercises the control of local leaders and neighborhood councils that consist of individuals close to the ADL. The legion is also represented in Aleppo's provincial and city councils. Each square has sub-offices that directly oversee the provision of services related to education, culture, religious affairs, and other matters. Within all these squares of influence and control, the group maintains control of the law enforcement and local governance.\nIn 2021, the Aleppo Defenders Legion established a Shia faction, specifically people from the Twelver-Ja'fari sect, of the group after recruiting people from villages in the Aleppo Governorate and Idlib Governorate including the villages of Nubl, Al-Zahra, Kafriya, and Al-Foua in addition they recruited Sunni Muslims from the area to teach them Shi'ite doctrine. Children's areas were also set up where some children were recruited for military work.\nReferences\n^ a b Sharawi, Ahmad; Hayek, Abdullah (2023-12-21). \"Profile: Aleppo Defenders Legion\".

    "Governor of Badakhshan, Afghanistan\nQari Mohammad Ayub Khalid (Pashto: \u0642\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u06cc\u0648\u0628 \u062e\u0627\u0644\u062f) is an Afghan Taliban leader who is currently serving as the provincial governor of Afghanistan's northeastern Badakhshan Province.\nCareer\nPrior to Ayub Khalid's provincial governor postings, he reportedly served as the commander of Taliban's eastern forces.\nGovernor of Kunar\nMain article: Governor of Kunar Province\nAyub Khalid began as governor of Kunar Province on 4 May 2023, nearly two years into the declared Taliban Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA). His tenure in Kunar was short-lived, lasting only two months, before he'd be reassigned to Badakhshan following the assassination of acting governor Nisar Ahmad Ahmadi.\nGovernor of Badakhshan\nMain article: Governors of Badakhshan\nBadakhshan Province\nOn 26 June 2023, Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada appointed Ayub Khalid to serve as the governor of Badakhshan Province, departing his former position as governor of Kunar Province with Mawlawi Qudratullah Abu Hamza replacing him (Abu Hamza transferred from governorship in Zabul). Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid announced the inter-province transfer via Twitter alongside appointments to governorate posts in Kunar and Zabul. Ayub Khalid's appointment as governor of Badakhshan shortly followed the assassination of the province's former acting governor, Nisar Ahmad Ahmadi, by the Islamic State's Khorasan Province (ISIS\u2013K). On 6 June 2023, an explosive-laden vehicle was driven into Ahmadi's vehicle while driving in the provincial capital of Faizabad killing Ahmadi, his driver, and injuring six nearby civilians.\nProjects\nIn mid-January 2024, Ayub Khalid announced in an interview with the state-controlled Bakhtar News Agency both the completion of the Little Pamir Road connecting Afghanistan and the People's Republic of China and upcoming plans to pave the road with asphalt. The road project was initiated by the former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in order to open investment opportunities (primarily resource mining) in Afghanistan to the Chinese market. While praising the improved opportunities for trade with China, Ayub Khalid made no comments regarding Chinese funding of the project. Chinese critics, including Zhu Yongbiao, an international relations scholar from Lanzhou University, have expressed wariness towards the actual economic value of the road and the risks of Uyghur militants traveling between Afghanistan and Xinjiang Province, viewing the project's primary value as symbolic. In an interview with the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, Zhu described the road as \"largely devoid of practical access and economic value... It is not only too costly, it will not bring any economic value in the short term\" adding \"China must have its security considerations. The road is not economically worthwhile, but it must have security risks.\"\nIncidents\nSee also: 2024 Badakhshan Dassault Falcon 10 crash\nAt 7:00 PM AFT on 21 January 2024, a Dassault Falcon 10 business jet medically evacuating a woman from Rayong, Thailand to Moscow along with her husband and a flight crew (all Russian nationals) crashed in the mountains of Badakhshan Province after attempting a emergency low-fuel landing in Tajikistan. Afghan search teams, including the Afghan Air Force, located the downed aircraft and later a surviving nurse with minor injuries. After reports surfaced of a supposed $1.2 million sum missing from the crashed plane, Ayub Khalid created an investigative commission to look into the reported theft. The validity of the reports as well as the results of that investigation remain unclear.\nFrom 3 to 13 May 2024, nearly a year into Ayub Khalid's tenure as provincial governor, a series of rare protests and demonstrations against Taliban public administration broke out in the Darayim and Argo districts of Badakhshan. Complaints presented by protestors included the Taliban's unpopular hardline policies and the Taliban's installation of provincial leaders from other provinces including a governor (Ayub Khalid) from Kandahar, a deputy governor from Takhar, a police commander from Parwan, and a security chief from Laghman. Protests began on 3 May in response to strong Taliban enforcement of bans on illicit drugs where many impoverished Badakhshani farmers draw sole income on opium-producing poppy crops. Opposing the burning of poppy fields, protestors shuttered shops and chanted against Supreme Leader Akhundzada who had issued the ruling against poppy cultivation. The Taliban dispatched a team of negotiators to meet with protesting farmers and eventually announced a peaceful end to the demonstrations. When protests returned on 13 May, the Taliban brutally cracked down and opened fire on protestors, killing two, wounding more than twelve others.\nPersonal life\nMohammad Ayub Khalid was born in the Pashtun-dominant southern province of Kandahar. Ayub Khalid was reportedly once close to Mullah Dadullah, a former top Taliba",
    "\nRuler of Wey\nDuke Huan of Wey (Chinese: \u885b\u6853\u516c; pinyin: W\u00e8i Hu\u00e1n G\u014dng, died 719 BC), personal name Ji Wan (\u59ec\u5b8c), was the 13th ruler of the state of Wey during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. \nBackground\nPrince Wan was born to Duke Zhuang I of Wey and his concubine Dai Gui\u00a0. Dai Gui's elder sister, Li Gui\u00a0, was also one of his concubines; she had given birth to Count Xiao (\u5b5d\u4f2f), who had died young. After Dai Gui died, Duke Zhuang had Zhuang Jiang\u00a0, his principal wife who had no children, raise Prince Wan. It was then that Duke Zhuang made Prince Wan the crown prince.\nAccession and Reign\nPrince Wan succeeded his father upon his death in 735 BC.\nIn 733 BC, Duke Huan dismissed his younger brother Zhouyu of all his posts on account of his arrogance and extravagance. Zhouyu, who was greatly favored by his father Duke Zhuang, went into exile.\nIn 722 BC, Duke Huan went to Lu to attend the funeral of Duke Hui of Lu. In the same year, Gongshu Duan, younger brother of Duke Zhuang of Zheng, rebelled against him, but he was defeated and forced into exile. Prince Hua (\u6ed1), a son of Gongshu Duan, fled to Wey. Duke Huan, on behalf of Prince Hua, attacked Zheng, occupying the Zheng settlement of Linyan (\u5eea\u5ef6). Duke Zhuang of Zheng then launched multiple counterattacks against Wey: once in the same year, once in the next.\nDeath and Succession\nIn 719 BC, Zhouyu gathered his fellow Wey exiles and murdered Duke Huan. This was the first known case of regicide in the Spring and Autumn period.\nZhouyu then seized the throne for himself. Less than a year later, he was arrested in the neighboring state of Chen in a plot led by Wey Minister Shi Que\u00a0, sent back to Wey, and executed. Wey officials then invited Prince Jin (\u6649), Duke Huan and Zhouyu's younger brother who was then a political hostage in the neighboring state of Xing, back to Wey to take the throne. Prince Jin would become known as Duke Xuan of Wey.\nBibliography\nZuo Zhuan, Duke Yin\nShiji, vol. 14, 37\nDurrant, Stephen; Li, Wai-yee; Schaberg, David (2016).

    "An upcoming roller coaster at Six Flags Over Georgia\nGeorgia Surfer is an upcoming steel launched shuttle roller coaster at Six Flags Over Georgia in Austell, Georgia, opening in 2025.\nHistory\nOrigins\nLiechtenstein-based Intamin first revealed their upgraded Ultra Surf roller coaster concept in July 2021, allowing the rotating vehicles to traverse a shuttle track and interact with water features. The first of these would have gone to NovaWorld Phan Thiet, a new theme and water park resort in B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn province, Vietnam. The planned adventure park however was unexpectedly cancelled, and in December 2022 the project's intended collection of rides \u2013 including the coaster \u2013 were listed for sale.\nIn response to November 2022's plummeting attendance figures and tensions with shareholders, then-Six Flags leadership began purchasing whatever attractions they could have delivered to their parks as quickly as possible. While Kid Flash Cosmic Coaster was procured due to the manufacturer's flexibility, the chain worked with Vekoma to secure coasters that had already been manufactured for cancelled international projects, such as Rookie Racer at Six Flags St. Louis and The Flash: Vertical Velocity at Six Flags Great Adventure. Intamin's Ultra Surf coaster itself had already been partially manufactured, with some hardware having already been delivered to Vietnam and the rest remaining at Stakotra Manufacturing in Pie\u0161\u0165any, Slovakia.\nAnnouncement and Construction\nSix Flags Over Georgia commenced demolition of the remaining Splashwater Falls concrete pool in June 2023; the former Hopkins Rides Shoot the chute had operated at the park from 1986 to 2018. Leading up to the announcement, park social media cryptically referred to actions such as \"launch\" and \"spinning\". A faux cargo box was placed in the park, featuring stamps from five different countries; they were eventually determined to be locations of Intamin's offices.\nOn August 19, 2023, the park announced a new unnamed roller coaster for the 2024 season, the first-of-its-kind type of coaster to their park. A naming contest was held; more than 2,500 suggestions were submitted and later narrowed down to three, with Georgia Surfer emerging as the winner in February 2024.\nOn August 12, 2024, Six Flags Over Georgia announced on their social media that the roller coaster had been postponed until 2025. The park blamed the delay on supply chain issues and challenges associated with developing the prototype, but assured that it would be ready for their seasonal opening in 2025.\nRide experience\nGeorgia Surfer is 144 feet (44\u00a0m) in height, reaches a maximum speed of 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h), and has a track length of 590 feet (180\u00a0m). The ride features one train with two circular cars that each seats 10 riders.\nThe roller coaster will launch forward and backwards along the track, reaching speeds of 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) during its course. At the ending of the ride, the coaster train will feature a splashdown in a pool of water.\nReferences\n^ a b Theme Parks To The Max (August 17, 2024). \"\ud83d\udea8 Georgia Surfer OFFICIAL Update \ud83d\udea8 Opening Date Announced!\".

    "Road in Kenya\nThe A9 road is a road in Kenya spanning a total distance of 398 kilometers. It traverses the central region of the country in a north\u2013south direction, connecting the towns of Subuiga, Meru, and Embu, before terminating in Kibwezi. The road plays a role in facilitating the movement of people and goods within the region.\nRoute\nThe A9 trunk road originates in Subuiga, intersecting with the A2 highway on the northern slope of Mount Kenya, Africa's second-highest peak at 5,199 meters. From there, the A9 traverses the eastern flank of the mountain, navigating through a densely populated region known for its fertile soil. The road winds its way through the contours of the mountain's slopes, passing through varied elevations: approximately 2,000 meters in the north, and 1,300-1,500 meters in the eastern and southern sections. South of Mount Kenya lies the town of Embu, a significant urban center along the route. The A9 continues southward, entering a drier savannah region at an elevation of around 1,000 meters. The road crosses the Kamburu Dam and remains paved throughout this section. A brief overlap with the A3 highway occurs before the A9 resumes its southern trajectory, traversing a more sparsely populated area characterized by flat terrain, dry savannah, and occasional low ridges. The road gradually descends to approximately 700 meters above sea level before terminating in Kibwezi, where it meets the A8 highway.\nHistory\nThe northern section of the A9 route traverses densely populated areas surrounding Mount Kenya and the highlands further south, which have been paved for an extended period. Notably, the construction of the Kamburu Dam, spanning the A9 motorway, took place between 1971 and 1974. In contrast, the southern portion of the route was paved later, with initial efforts focusing on the segment between the A3 highway and Kitui, which was fully completed in the mid-2000s. The 192-kilometer stretch south of Kitui remained unpaved for a longer duration, with paving commencing around 2017 and substantially concluding in 2021. The A9 is strategically positioned as a bypass for through traffic between Ethiopia and the port city of Mombasa, diverting traffic away from Nairobi. The paving of this route was financed by China, underscoring the importance of this transportation artery in regional connectivity.\nRoad number history\nHistorically, the road was categorized as a lower-class route, designated as B6 in the northern section spanning from Mount Kenya to Embu, and B7 in the southern section from Embu to Kibwezi. In 2016, these sections were unified and reclassified as the A9, elevating the road's status and reflecting its growing importance in the regional transportation network. This reclassification acknowledged the route's expanded capacity and connectivity, solidifying its role as a vital transportation artery.\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Kenya Roads Board\".

    "Bridge in North Yorkshire, England\nThe bridge, in 2020\nUlshaw Bridge is a historic bridge in the hamlet of Ulshaw Bridge, in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe bridge crosses the River Ure, east of Middleham.  It has sometimes been described as lying on the line of a Roman road, although no such road has been located, and the discovery of a Roman fort in Wensley suggests that a more northerly route is likely.  A wooden bridge over the Ure near Middleham was recorded\nby John Leland, although it is not certain whether it was on this site.  The first definite reference to the bridge was in 1588, when 200 marks were spent repairing it.\nThe bridge was rebuilt between 1673 and 1674, at a cost of \u00a31,000.  The new bridge spanned 65 feet (20\u00a0m), and was 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) wide.  The parapets were later rebuilt, probably in the late 19th century. Nikolaus Pevsner described the bridge as \"an impressive job with three pairs of mighty cutwaters\".\nThe bridge, which carries a minor road, is built of a mixture of carved stone and rubble.  It consists of four segmental arches, one with a chamfered surround, and with rusticated parapets.  There are triangular cutwaters rising to refuges, two with seats, the middle one containing an octagonal sundial base with initials and the date.  It has been a scheduled monument since 1925, and was grade II listed in 1967.\nSee also\nListed buildings in East Witton\nReferences\n^ \"Bainbridge eastwards\". The Roads of Roman Britain.

    "Prince of Pingyuan (\u5e73\u539f\u738b)\nIn this Chinese name, the family name is  Sima.\nSima Gan (\u53f8\u9a6c\u69a6; 232 - 26 February 311), courtesy name Ziliang (\u5b50\u826f), was the youngest son of Sima Yi and his main wife Zhang Chunhua, and a younger brother of Sima Shi and Sima Zhao. Sima Yi, Sima Shi and Sima Zhao eventually became regents of the Cao Wei state during the Three Kingdoms era.\nEarly life and career up to 260\nSima Gan was born in 232, as the youngest son of Sima Yi and his wife Zhang Chunhua. Like his brothers, Sima Gan was given various posts and titles during the Cao Wei era.\nThe first recorded historical event Sima Gan was involved in was the attempted coup by Cao Mao, by then a puppet under Sima Zhao's control. In June 260, Cao Mao launched a coup in an attempt to seize back power from Sima Zhao. Man Changwu (a grandson of Man Chong) was in charge of guarding one of the palace gates. Sima Gan led his men to the palace to assist Sima Zhao, but Man Changwu refused to let him pass and told him to enter through another gate instead. Later, when Sima Zhao asked Sima Gan why he was late, Sima Gan told him what happened.\nDuring the Jin era\nSima Zhao was made Prince of Jin on 2 May 264. With this elevation, Sima Gan was later made Count of Dingtao. In February 266, Sima Zhao's son Sima Yan accepted Cao Huan's abdication and founded the Jin dynasty. Sima Gan was then made Prince of Pingyuan, with a fiefdom of 11,300 households. Although his fiefdom was large, he did not take an active role in administration; instead, he appointed officials based on their abilities and the positions which needed to be filled. He also allowed his income (cloth, silk) to accumulate and rot.\nSima Yan died in May 290, and his son Sima Zhong ascended the throne. During audiences with the emperor, as the emperor's great-uncle, Sima Gan was allowed to wear his shoes and carry his sword, as well as walk at a normal pace.\nThe Book of Jin recorded several anecdotes between Sima Gan and his grandnephew Sima Jiong. During the War of the Eight Princes, after Sima Jiong defeated Sima Lun, while other clansmen of the Sima family and court officials sent oxen and wine as gifts to Sima Jiong, Sima Gan offered him 100 cash. At their meeting, Sima Gan said, \"The Prince of Zhao (Sima Lun) caused a rebellion and you managed to put it down; that is your credit. Now, I'm congratulating you using these 100 cash. Even so, it is very difficult to remain at a high position; you must be careful and cautious.\" After becoming regent, Sima Jiong once received a visit from his great-uncle. While Sima Jiong stepped out of the house and received Sima Gan with courtesy, upon entering the house, Sima Gan sat down on Jiong's bed and did not allow Jiong to be seated. Gan then said,\"You must not emulate the son of that Bai woman (referring to Sima Lun).\" After Sima Jiong was killed in January 303, Sima Gan cried bitterly and told those around him, \"The Sima clan is waning; only this child is the most capable. Now that he has died, the Sima clan is in peril!\"\nDescendants\nSima Gan was recorded to have two sons. The elder Sima Guang died young and presumably left no descendants; the younger Sima Yong and his family were later killed, presumably during the Disaster of Yongjia.\nReferences\n^ (\u4e01\u536f\uff0c...\u5c01\u7687\u53d4\u7956\u7236\u5b5a\u4e3a\u5b89\u5e73\u738b\uff0c\u53d4\u7236\u5e72\u4e3a\u5e73\u539f\u738b\u3001...)

In this account, Sima Gan was denied entry by Sun You (\u5b6b\u4f51), who was also an officer guarding the main gate, so he had to enter the palace through another gate. When Sima Zhao found out why Sima Gan showed up late, he wanted to execute Sun You and his family. However, Xun Xu advised him against it by pointing out that it would be unfair and unjust",

    "German saboteur for Belarusian opposition\nRico Krieger is a German citizen, most notable for his reported sabotage work inside Belarus for the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski Regiment, subsequent detainment, and release during the 2024 Russian prisoner exchange.\nBefore his detainment, Krieger worked as an rescue medic for the German Red Cross, but reportedly had a desire to aid Ukraine after witnessing Russia's aggression during their invasion of Ukraine on the news. After contacting the SBU with a desire to join the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski Regiment, a Belarusian opposition military regiment, the SBU supposedly tasked Krieger with a reconnaissance and sabotage mission inside of Belarus as a prerequisite to joining, according to Belarusian authorities. On 2 October 2023, Krieger arrived in Belarus to allegedly take photos and record coordinates of military objects in the Mogilev Region. He reportedly ended his mission by detonating a bomb at the railway station in Asipovichy, damaging the tracks but causing no injuries and while attempting the leave the country on 6 October, Krieger was detained at the Minsk National Airport.\nHis subsequent trial, which began eight months later on 6 June 2024, saw Krieger charged with six crimes: including \"mercenary activity\", \"terrorism\", and \"agent activity\". He was found guilty on all counts and given the death penalty through execution by firing squad, the first time this verdict had ever been given to a foreign citizen. The severity of the verdict was immediately challenged by the German government and human rights groups alike. On 25 July 2024, Krieger appeared on Belarusian state-run TV in a plead to ask Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko for a pardon, a move likely done in duress for propaganda purposes. The plead brought more attention to his case internationally, and by 30 July, Krieger was pardoned by Lukashenko. Two days later, he became part of the 2024 Russian prisoner exchange as the only prisoner coming from a nation other than Russia.\nBiography\nKrieger is a German citizen born in Berlin. He has one child, a daughter, who was under 18 years old at the time of his arrest. Between 2015 and 2016, Krieger worked for Pond Security at the US embassy in Berlin as an armed security officer, where he familiarized himself with operations security. During this time, Krieger reportedly had plans to apply for a US passport and emigrate to the US. He ended up leaving the embassy to work in healthcare as a nurse though, eventually specializing as a emergency medical technician (EMT).\nBefore his arrest, Krieger was a 29 or 30 year old rescue medic for the German Red Cross (DRK), but reportedly also had intentions to serve as a military doctor in the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski Regiment, a Belarusian opposition military regiment formed to defend Ukraine after the Russian invasion in 2022, after witnessing the Russian aggression in the news. Through attempting to join the regiment, Krieger made contact with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), for which he later carried out his mission supposedly as a prerequisite to joining. This narrative presented by Belarus is likely false, however, as foreign volunteers for Ukraine have never been required to carry out such risky missions as an initiation to join. It is also unclear whether or not Krieger ever joined the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski Regiment before his arrest. In his later trial, Krieger was charged with \"terrorism\" for being part of the Regiment, designated as a  terrorist organization by Belarus, with screenshots of encrypted emails trying to join the Regiment taken from Krieger's phone used as evidence to support this claim. According to a investigation by the BBC, however, the email addressed used were fake, and no actual communication between Krieger and the Regiment was ever presented in court. Furthermore, after being contacted, the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski Regiment replied \"he is not our fighter\" when referring to Krieger.\nActivities leading to detention\nThe Asipovichy railway station in 2009, where the explosion took place in 2023\nAccording to Belarusian authorities and confessions later made by Krieger (possibly under duress), Krieger received orders from the SBU no later than 20 September 2023 to carry out this mission. He arrived in Belarus on 2 October 2023 under the persona of a tourist, carrying phones and a drone. This was confirmed by the German Red Cross who later stated Krieger's travel to Belarus was unrelated to his work with them. Under the supposed orders from the Security Service of Ukraine, Krieger first traveled to the Mogilev Region, and then to the railway station in Asipovichy to take reconnaissance photos and record the coordinates of military objects. The city of Asipovichy and the surrounding area were all known locations for hosting Belarusian and Wagner PMC military elements, with the railway station serving as a crucial hub for transporting military equipment around the capital Minsk.

    "Austro-Hungarian diplomat (1866\u20131934)\nThe native form of this personal name is Sz\u00e9chenyi Dionys. This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nCount D\u00e9nes \"Dionys\" Sz\u00e9chenyi de S\u00e1rv\u00e1r-fels\u0151vid\u00e9k (1 December 1866 \u2013 26 January 1934), was an Austro Hungarian soldier and diplomat.\nEarly life\nSz\u00e9chenyi on 1 December 1866 in Pest, then a part of Austria-Hungary, a dual monarchy established in 1867. Born into a prominent Hungarian noble family, he was the eldest son of Count Imre Sz\u00e9chenyi de S\u00e1rv\u00e1r-fels\u0151vid\u00e9k (1825\u20131898), the former Austrian Minister at the Court of Berlin and his wife, Countess Alexandra Szt\u00e1ray de Szt\u00e1ra et Nagy-Mih\u00e1ly (1843\u20131914). The Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi family were one of the oldest and wealthiest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His younger brothers were Count Peter Sz\u00e9chenyi (who married Maria Ilona Esterh\u00e1zy de Gal\u00e1ntha), Count Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi, and Count L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sz\u00e9chenyi (who married American heiress Gladys Vanderbilt).\nHis paternal grandparents were Count Ludwig \"Lajos\" Maria Aloys Sz\u00e9chenyi (eldest son of Count Ferenc Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi) and, his second wife, Austrian Countess Francisca (n\u00e9e von Wurmbrand-Stuppach) Sz\u00e9chenyi. His maternal grandparents were Count Ferdin\u00e1nd Szt\u00e1ray de Szt\u00e1ra et Nagy-Mih\u00e1ly, and Matilda Klobusiczky.\nCareer\nSz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi and his three brothers were all Reserve Lieutenants in the Imperial and Royal Hussars as well as Chamberlains at the Court.

    "Gaelic footballer\nJimmy White is a Gaelic football referee, administrator, coach, manager, player-manager and former player. He is from Killybegs.\nCareer\nAs an inter-county manager White led Donegal to an Ulster Minor Football Championship in 1985, and Ulster League title in the same year. He served as part of P. J. McGowan's backroom team when Donegal won the 1987 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship.\nWhite was a wing-back and was part of the CLG Na Cealla Beaga team that won five Donegal Senior Football Championship titles, in 1988, 1991, 1992, 1995 and 1996, and he played in two other finals without winning, in 1990 and 1993. He was involved in six of the seven finals, missing the 1996 final, even though he had played in each of the earlier matches in the competition. He served as player-manager of the team during this time as well, including in the championship winning seasons of 1991, 1992 and 1995, as well as helping the team to record three consecutive Division One League titles between 1991 and 1993. He did so after John Joe O'Shea, a Kerry native, stood aside as manager.\nWhen he stopped playing as 1996 drew to close, White began refereeing. He rose to inter-county level and was involved at all grades of the game from minor to senior. He was noted for his fitness levels and a characteristic calmness.\nWhite officiated at his first Donegal Senior Final in 1999. He refereed his sixth Donegal Senior Final twenty years later, in 2019 (first replay), tying the all-time record, having earlier been a linesman in the drawn match. His finals in between were 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2011, and there was also the 2005 replay, which was when Naomh Conaill won their first title.\nWhite refereed several senior inter-county championship finals, as well as an All-Ireland Championship final. He was the first Donegal man to referee an Ulster final in 2008. He was referee for the 2010 Connacht final. But, as he reached his fiftieth birthday the same year, he became the first inter-county referee who was forced against his will to stop officiating at inter-county level, in accordance with a recently passed motion of the GAA that ruled in favour of an age limit. His last game as an inter-county referee was the 2011 Dr McKenna Cup final between Derry and Tyrone.\nWhite continues to referee club games. In 2019, he had to leave the field of play on a stretcher after hurting his ankle. His club record includes two Ulster Club Championship finals.\nWhite also works as a tutor for aspiring referees. His daughter has played inter-county football for Donegal.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l Campbell, Peter (23 October 2019). \"Jimmy White equals Donegal record this Sunday with his sixth senior Donegal final\".\n^ \"Killybegs 1991, one of the greatest Donegal teams\". 14 October 2016.\n^ a b McShea, Pauric (11 July 2023). \"Referees deserve so much more respect than we're currently giving them\".\n^ a b \"Referee announced for Donegal SFC final replay\". 23 October 2019.\n^ a b c d e \"White steps down\". irishtimes.com. 11 March 2011.\n^ \"Jimmy White confirmed as referee for big Donegal championship clash\". 9 September 2013.\n^ \"Jimmy White makes quick recovery as ref' appointments revealed for semi-finals\". 3 October 2019.\n^ Breen, Sinead (11 April 2019). \"Seventeen new referees for Donegal\".\n",
    "Military unit\n93rd Infantry Regiment is a unit of 91st Infantry Division of Philippine Army activated in 1941. It was not organized until late of 1941. So it was left in Leyte island while the rest of the division was transferred to Luzon island to bolster its defense. It fought in Mindanao island where it was ordered to surrender and became POWs.\nOrganization\nThe regiment was the last to be organized of the 91st Division and it was left in Leyte as it was still being organized and undergoing training. Captain John Goldtrap of 31st Infantry Regiment of US Army along with other young officers and enlisted men was sent to train the men and advise the officers. As the hostilities commence Goldtrap was given of the command. In December 1941, it was part of Samar Brigade under Colonel Theodore Cornell along with 81st Infantry Regiment who was transferred from Cebu.\nTransfer to Mindanao\nIn January 1942, the brigade was ordered to transfer to Mindanao, the second largest island in the Philippines to bolster its defense. Major Goldtrap took over the command of the regiment as Colonel BenHur Chastaine was moved to command the brigade during its transfer and upon arrival in Mindanao.\nCombat\nIn March 1942, the regiment was transferred to Bukidnon as part of Colonel William Dalton's reserve force of Mindanao Force. It was posted in the left side of Mangima Canyon extended to Dalirig. It went to action to prevent Japanese move southward of Sayre highway.  They fought at the Battle of Mangima Canyon and gave the Japanese high casualties but had to pullback as 62nd Infantry Regiment withdrawn on their left flank.

    "German coachbuilding company\nKarosserie Wendler logo\nWendler was a German wheelwright and car body manufacturer in Reutlingen.\nHistory\nThe company was opened by Erhard Wendler in 1840 as a carriage factory. Initially, he manufactured carriages, and from the early 1920s, car bodies as well. The designer Helmut Schwandner initiated the reorientation. In the 1920s, around 60 bodies were built, and in the 1930s there were 250 to 270. The workforce consisted of around 100 employees. One of the customers in 1937 was the architect Wilhelm Ritter von Graf.\nAfter the Second World War, Wendler resumed the production of car bodies, which were now built in the modern ponton shape. Series production continued until the end of the 1950s, then the focus shifted mainly to repairs.\nOne of Wendler's most important clients was Porsche, who, among other things, had Wendler build 90 light-alloy bodies (according to other sources, more than 100) for the Porsche 550. For the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans, Wendler designed a Porsche coup\u00e9, but it was never built. Instead, he developed his own car based on a Porsche, the W-RS 001.\nLater, the company was involved in vintage car restoration and special construction of armored limousines.\nIn 2000, Wendler became insolvent. The company continued to operate under the name Pgam AG until its final closure.\nGallery\nGutbrod Superior with a body by Wendler (1951)\nCabriolet based on a Volkswagen and bodied by Wendler (1957)\n1960 Bentley S2 with shooting brake bodywork by Wendler \nLiterature\nRalf J.

    "1868 battle of the Ten Years' War\nThe Las Clavellinas Uprising was a military engagement of the Ten Years' War. It took place on November 4, 1868, at the Las Clavellinas estate, near Puerto Pr\u00edncipe (now Camag\u00fcey) in Cuba. It was the initial armed uprising in the Camag\u00fcey Province against the Spanish colonial government.\nHistory\nT\u00ednima Masonic Lodge No. 16 in Puerto Pr\u00edncipe, which included distinguished individuals like Salvador Cisneros Betancourt and Ignacio Agramonte, began to engage in revolutionary activities. In the summer of 1868, Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes conducted revolutionary meetings among various revolutionary groups that had been developing within the Cuban province's masonic lodges.\nFollowing the Cry of Yara led by Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes in Eastern Cuba in October 1868, the conspirators in Camag\u00fcey, Central Cuba, backed the insurrection. Organized by Salvador Cisneros Betancourt to counter the Spanish consolidation in Eastern Cuba, Gen. Jer\u00f3nimo Boza Agramonte assumed command while Col. Eduardo Agramonte Pi\u00f1a mobilized the insurgents.\nThe Battle\nWith the prevailing circumstances conveyed by Salvador Cisneros Betancourt, the Camag\u00fceyans swiftly launched the uprising. Eduardo Agramonte Pi\u00f1a summoned his trusted allies to gather at 7:00 AM the following morning. Around 76 patriots determined to launch into the fight, on November 4, 1868, met on the banks of the Las Clavellinas river, three miles from Puerto Pr\u00edncipe (now Camag\u00fcey), along Nuevitas\u2013Camag\u00fcey Road.\nFrom Las Clavellinas, they marched to the El Cercado sugar mill, setting up camp to arrange and stockpile weapons, horses, and equipment. The men were organized into a small but efficient force of several platoons under the command of Jer\u00f3nimo Boza Agramonte. His lieutenants were appointed to lead the seven groups into which the insurgent forces were divided including Ignacio Mora, Manuel Boza Agramonte, Mart\u00edn Loynaz, Jos\u00e9 Recio Betancourt, Eduardo Agramonte, Francisco Arteaga Pi\u00f1a, and Manuel Agramonte Porro.\nA force led by Napole\u00f3n Arango and Augusto Arango forced a Spanish garrison, consisting of a lieutenant and 30 cavalrymen, to surrender on November 4, 1868, at San Miguel de Bag\u00e1 near Nuevitas. The capture of the town of Gu\u00e1imaro occurred by November 6, 1868.\nAftermath\nBlas Villate, a General of the Spanish Army, landed in Vertientes on November 17, 1868, under the direction of Captain General Francisco de Lersundi y Hormaechea, to pacify the rebellion, and reached Puerto Pr\u00edncipe on the 19th.

    "\nOn 4 August 2005 a barber was shot dead by soldiers in Inuvil in northern Sri Lanka. A police officer was abducted and killed in the subsequent protests by locals.\nShooting\nAt around 1pm on 4 August 2005 five soldiers arrived at a barbershop at Inuvil Junction on the Jaffna-Kankesanturai road in Inuvil. Three of the soldiers handed over their firearms to the other two who stepped outside. As two of the soldiers were having their hair cut a firearm discharged from outside, piercing the flimsy metal frontage of the barbershop and hitting barbers Jeyaseelan Shantharubann (23) and K. Logathas (29). Shantharubann, a native of Trincomalee District living in Kondavil and working in his uncle's barbershop, was pronounced dead on arrival at Jaffna Hospital. Logathas was treated for shock.\nProtests\nAs news of the shooting spread, tension mounted in the area and locals started gathering at the scene at around 3pm. Troops stationed nearby also rushed to scene but were met by an angry crowd that blocked the road by cutting down nearby trees, burnt tyres and stoned army vehicles. The protestors demanded that the soldiers, whom they claimed had deliberately shot the barbers, be brought to justice.\nWith around 1,000 people taking part in the protests, police from nearby Achchuveli and Chunnakam arrived at the scene together with the riot squad. By 5pm the situation was worsening when Superintendent Charles Wijewardena arrived with reinforcements. Wijewardena, the most senior police officer at the scene, decided to negotiate with the protestors and walked over to them, leaving the police position which was some distance from the protestors. As dusk fell the police lost sight of Wijewardena who had disappeared. Eyewitnesses claimed that Wijewardena had been taken captive by protestors and taken away from the protest site.\nA search operation was mounted and the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), which was monitoring the ceasefire between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), was informed of Wijewardena's disappearance. His body was found in Palavodai on the Inuvil-Suthumalai road about 2\u00a0km from the shooting site. His body had cut and stab wounds and he was in a sarong rather than trousers.\nThe protesters dispersed after a curfew was imposed, initially in the Valikamam region and then the whole of Jaffna District.\nWijewardena's funeral was held on 7 August 2005 in his hometown of Kurunegala.\nInvestigation\nOn 5 August 2005, police from Manipay produced five soldiers before Mallakam magistrate Sarjoini Illangovan in connection with the shooting incident. The two soldiers who had been possession of the firearms during the incident were remanded until 20 August 2005. On 17 August 2005, police, supported by the army, arrested LTTE official Kathiramalai Vaitheehan (alias Gopi, alias Veerapandiyan) at his parents house in Kaladdy, Kokkuvil in connection with Wijewardena's killing. Two police officers (N. M. Hemage and L. Jeyalath) were injured during the arrest. The LTTE complained to the SLMM that Gopi's arrest violated the 2002 cease-fire agreement.\nColombo magistrate Sarojini Kusala Weerawardene released Gopi on 26 October 2005 after Attorney General's Department informed the court that there was no evidence against him to file an indictment. None of the witnesses, which included police officers, were able to identify Gopi during the identification parade at Colombo Magistrate's Court on 16 September 2005. Gopi, fearing for his life, requested that the court provide security for him but Weerawardene refused, stating that she did not have the power to do so.\nThe University Teachers for Human Rights accused Easwaran, the LTTE's political commissar for Nallur, of playing a leading role in the abduction and killing of Wijewardena.\nReaction\nPresident Chandrika Kumaratunga issued a statement on the morning of 5 August 2005 condemning the shooting and ordering the authorities to fully investigate the incident and to bring the perpetrators to justice without delay. She also posthumously promoted Wijewardena to Senior Superintendent of Police. Later that day she issued another statement in which she blamed the two soldiers for the incident, stating that they had contravened military regulations on several counts.\nThe army claimed that they had photographic evidence to prove that the shooting was an accident and that the gun had misfired. They accused the LTTE of mud slinging  and of instigating Wijewardena's killing. The army however admitted that the soldiers had broken regulations by going to the barbershop as hair cutting facilities are provided at army barracks.\nThe Colombo-based Sinhalese owned media were virtually silent on Shantharubann's killing but, like the Sri Lankan military, were quick to blame the LTTE for Wijewardena's killing without providing any evidence. The LTTE denied any involvement.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h Haran, Shree (12 August 2005). \"Killing in northern Sri Lanka: a",

    "\n2024 soundtrack album by Joff Bush\nRug Island is the third soundtrack album of the Australian animated television series Bluey. It will be released on 25 October 2024 by Demon Records. Most of the soundtrack's music was composed and performed by Joff Bush, the composer for the television program, alongside a team of musicians.\nMuch like the previous two albums, the soundtrack was released through Demon Music Group, a subdivision of BBC Studios, who hold global rights to release the show's music. The first single, \"Octopus\", was released on 2 August 2024.\nBackground and composition\nJoff Bush serves as the primary composer of Bluey, writing half of the television show's score himself and leading a group of additional composers, including David Barber. Bush graduated from the Queensland Conservatorium, where he met executive producer Daley Pearson, and before Bluey, worked on series such as The Family Law and Australian Survivor. Bush has stated that each episode has its own unique musical style, and he likes to become involved in the episodes as they are scripted; he regularly has detailed discussions with series creator Joe Brumm. Live instruments are regularly played for the recordings. Every episode of Bluey is individually scored, a decision made by Brumm, who was inspired by the original compositions for Charlie and Lola while working on the series in the United Kingdom.\nBush recorded a soundtrack for the first series of the program, titled Bluey: The Album, which was released on 22 January 2021. The soundtrack debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart in February 2021. It was recognised as the first children's album to reach the top of the charts in Australia.

    "1989 painting by Robert Lentz\nApache Christ is a painting depicting Jesus as a Mescalero holy man. Created in 1989 by Franciscan friar Robert Lentz, the eight-foot icon is displayed in the altar of the St. Joseph Apache Mission Church, a Catholic church with parishioners who are mostly Mescalero Apache. In the painting, Jesus is depicted atop Sierra Blanca, greeting the rising sun after performing a sacred puberty ritual.\nLentz, who is known for his iconography depicting Jesus in different cultural contexts, painted Apache Christ in 1989 following a conversation with the church's pastor. He met with Mescalero Apache leaders and consulted with Apache medicine men for cultural guidance. In preparation for the artwork, he studied Apache rituals and gathered sacred spring water from the summit of Sierra Blanca to use in the mixing of his paints.\nIn 2024, a priest from St. Joseph removed Apache Christ and other sacred Mescalero art objects from display due to his view that they were pagan imagery. The removal outraged many of the church's parishioners. The painting was soon reinstalled and the priest was replaced.\nBackground\nThe St. Joseph Apache Mission Church was built in Mescalero, New Mexico, in the early 20th century on the site of a prehistoric ruin of the Jornada Mogollon culture. Located within the Mescalero Apache Reservation, the church administers to the Chiricahua and Mescalero Apache people. During the construction of the church in 1920, traditional and sacred Apache spiritual items were placed beneath the cornerstone. Albert Braun, a Roman Catholic priest who helped to construct the church, respected the traditions of the Mescalero Apache ministry and did not interfere with their culture.\nArtist Robert Lentz studied icon painting under Photis Kontoglou around 1977 at the Holy Transfiguration Monastery in Brookline, Massachusetts. He became a Franciscan friar and created icons depicting Jesus in different cultural contexts, not limiting his works to traditional \"European face\" characteristics.\nConception and execution\nThe altar of the St. Joseph Apache Mission Church in 1975, before the creation of the painting\nIn 1989, Lentz travelled to Mescalero, New Mexico, to visit St. Joseph. He discussed the possibility of creating a painting for the church with Father Larry Gosselin, a fellow Franciscan who was the church's pastor at the time. Gosselin asked for approval from 15 Mescalero Apache leaders and arranged for Lentz to meet with Apache medicine men for cultural guidance. Initially the medicine men did not approve of the project, but later acquiesced, recommending that Lentz not use anyone from Mescalero as a model for the work.\nIn preparation for creating the painting, Lentz familiarized himself with Apache rituals and made a pilgrimage to the summit of Sierra Blanca where he gathered water from the sacred springs to use for mixing his paint. According to Gosselin, Lentz \"poured all of himself into that painting\", sprinkling himself with gold dust and forgoing showering so his body oils would help to adhere the gold onto the canvas. He took three months to finish the painting. According to Lentz, the intention of the painting is to show \"that people could be Apache and Catholic, and both completely\".\nLentz gave Apache Christ to the Mescalero people. When he brought the finished painting to show to Father Gosselin, a nun named Juanita was conversing with some visiting women. As the painting was unveiled, there was a three-minute silence. Sister Juanita later said that they had been in silent awe. Apache Christ was installed on the wall behind the stone chapel's altar in 1990. It received a blessing from Father Gosselin during mass. The mass was paused midway through to allow the painting to receive a traditional blessing with cattail pollen from Mescalero medicine men.\nDescription\nInterior of the St. Joseph Apache Mission Church\nApache Christ serves as the centerpiece of the St. Joseph Apache Mission Church, representing a blending of Christian rites and sacred Apache ceremonies. The icon painting depicts Jesus as a Mescalero Apache medicine man standing on the summit of Sierra Blanca at dawn. In the 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) tall painting, he is dressed traditionally, wearing moccasins, a breech cloth, and a warrior shirt. His left hand is raised, the outward-facing palm bearing a sun symbol, while his left hand holds a deer hoof rattle. Before his feet is a basket containing sacred objects, including a grass brush, bags of tobacco, cattail pollen, and an eagle feather. An eagle flying in the background represents the Holy Spirit. Greek Christograms representing Jesus Christ are depicted in the halo and in the upper corners of the painting. The Apache words Bik\u2019egu'ind\u00e1n (\"Giver of Life\", one of the Apache names for the Creator) are inscribed on the lower border of the painting. An elaborate frame for the icon was hand-crafted by Roberto Lavadie, a wood sculptor based in New Mexico.\nIn the painting, Jesus is re",

It was recorded between Battiato's house in Milo (credited as \"L'Ottava\") and Fonoprint Studio in Bologna. Among the musicians who collaborated to the album, were former Denovo's members  Mario Venuti, Luca Madonia and Toni Carbone and Japanese soprano Hiroko Saito.

    "New Zealand military officer\nCharles Guy Powles, CMG DSO (15 December 1872 \u2013 17 June 1951) was an officer in the New Zealand Military Forces who served in the Second Boer War and the First World War. \nBorn in Wellington, Powles volunteered for the Fourth Contingent to fight in the Second Boer War, serving in Africa from April 1900 to June 1901. Afterwards he farmed but joined the New Zealand Military Forces in 1910 and served in the Staff Corps. On the outbreak of the First World War, he was appointed brigade major of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. He was involved in the campaign in Gallipoli, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. From 1916 to mid-1918 he served in the Middle East as assistant adjutant and quartermaster general of the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division. During this time he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.\nIn the postwar period he resumed his career with New Zealand Military Forces, serving in instructing and staff posts before retiring in 1927 as commander of the Central Military District. He was the principal of Flock House in civilian life but was recalled to military service during the Second World War to command Waiouru Military Camp. He died in Te Horo, aged 78.\nEarly life\nBorn on 15 December 1872 in Wellington, New Zealand, Charles Guy Powles was the son of C. P. Powles, a long time member of the Wellington College board of governors. Once Powles completed his schooling, he took up farming. He had an interest in the military, having served for a number of years in the Wellington College Cadets.\nSouth Africa\nPowles volunteered to join the Fourth Contingent raised for service in the Boer South African Republic. As a non-commissioned officer, he and the rest of the contingent, nicknamed the \"Rough Riders\", left New Zealand in March 1900 and landed in Portuguese East Africa the following month. The contingent were deployed as part of the Rhodesian Field Force around Mafeking. Aside from a brief action at Ottoshoop in August, the Rough Riders spent the majority of their war service in the Transvaal, carrying out reconnaissance patrols and pursuing Boer commandos. As part of the effort to deprive the Boers of resources, they also helped to destroy crops and round up civilians and cattle, during which they occasionally skirmished with armed commandos. In June 1901 the \"Rough Riders\" returned to New Zealand. By this time Powles was a lieutenant, having been commissioned the previous November.\nMilitary career\nAfter his return from South Africa, Powles went back to farming. However he sought a career as a professional soldier and in 1910 joined the New Zealand Military Forces. After training at Trentham Military Camp, he was posted as a lieutenant to the newly formed Staff Corps. He served as the adjutant of the 6th (Manawatu) Mounted Rifles, of the Territorial Force, from July 1911. Two years later he became the commander of No. 5 (Wellington) Group and was still serving in this capacity at the time of the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.\nFirst World War\nA group of New Zealand officers at Gallipoli in 1915; Powles stands in the centre\nPowles was seconded to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), raised for service in the war, and, holding the rank of captain, was appointed as the brigade major of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. This brigade departed New Zealand with the main body of the NZEF in mid-October 1914, destined for the Middle East. Once they had arrived at Alexandria, in Egypt, in December 1914, the troops of the NZEF expected to continue onto Europe after a period of training.\nHowever, in early April 1915, military planners in London decided that the NZEF would be part of the Allied forces that would open up a new front in the Middle East, by landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula. It was not until May that Powles's brigade was landed, sans horses, at Gallipoli. Powles would serve throughout the campaign at Gallipoli and in its final stages was commander of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment. For his services at Gallipoli he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order as well as being twice mentioned in despatches.\nIn early 1916, as part of the reorganisation of the NZEF that followed the Allied evacuation from Gallipoli, the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division was formed with Powles, promoted to acting lieutenant colonel, appointed assistant adjutant and quartermaster general. He would serve with the division for the next two years as it campaigned in the Sinai Desert and into Palestine. He was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in April 1918, the citation noting it was in recognition of his services during the operations to capture Jerusalem. He had already been mentioned twice in despatches earlier in the Sinai and Palestinian campaign and was later awarded the Egyptian Order of the Nile, 3rd Class.\nIn June Powles was sent to Europe, where he was sec",

    "German politician (1926\u20131976)\nWerner Wittig (24 October 1926 \u2013 8 January 1976) was a German politician and party functionary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nOne of a few former Nazis to have a political career in East Germany, Wittig rose to the position of First Secretary of the Bezirk Potsdam SED and became a member of the SED Central Committee.\nWittig's career was only cut short when he surprisingly died in January 1976 at the age of 49.\nLife and career\nEarly career\nAs the son of a farm laborer, he attended elementary school in Luckenwalde from 1933 to 1941 and completed an apprenticeship as a commercial clerk there from 1942 to 1944. Wittig applied for membership in the NSDAP on 17 February 1944, and was admitted on 20 April (Hitler's birthday) of the same year (membership number 10,090,408). From June 1944 to May 1945, he was a soldier in the Wehrmacht.\nAfter the war, he initially worked as a kitchen helper in a large kitchen in Luckenwalde. In August 1945, he became a member of the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany), and after the forced merger of the SPD and KPD (Communist Party of Germany) into the SED in the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ) in 1946, he became a member of the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany).\nAfter attending the State Party School in Schmerwitz near Wiesenburg/Mark, he worked full-time for the SED. His first role was as the state youth secretary of the Mark Brandenburg SED (1946/47). From 1948, he was the personal assistant to the chairman of the Brandenburg SED, Willy S\u00e4gebrecht, and from January 1949, head of the department in the office of the state chairman of the SED.\nFrom April 1952 to August 1953, he was the First Secretary of the SED in Potsdam City in the then State of Brandenburg and later Bezirk Potsdam. After attending the CPSU Higher Party School \"W. I. Lenin\" in Moscow from 1953 to 1956, he was appointed department head in the Bezirk Potsdam SED.\nSubsequently, from January 1961 to June 1964, he was the First Secretary of the SED in Brandenburg an der Havel.\nBezirk Potsdam SED First Secretary\nFormer Bezirk Potsdam SED building in 2008. The SED's logo still is faintly visible.\nIn June 1964, Wittig rose to the position of the First Secretary of the Bezirk Potsdam SED, longtime incumbent Kurt Seibt joining the Council of Ministers of East Germany as Minister of the newly created Ministry for the Guidance and Control of Bezirk and District Councils.\nWittig additionally became a full member of the Central Committee of the SED in April 1967 (VII. Party Congress) and the Volkskammer in later that year, nominally representing a constituency in the rural north of his Bezirk.\nOn behalf of Walter Ulbricht, Wittig was one of the main people responsible for the demolition of the Garnisonkirche ruins, despite opposition from a small part of the city council, including allegedly the then mayor of Potsdam, Brunhilde Hanke.\nIn 1970, Erich Honecker proposed him along with Harry Tisch as the chairman of the Volkskammer Committee for National Defense and successor to the late Paul Fr\u00f6hlich. However, this failed due to a calculated move by Honecker, who proposed Hermann Matern at the last minute, as his preferred candidate, Paul Verner, would not have been accepted by Ulbricht, and he saw Matern as an interim solution until the planned ousting of Ulbricht.\nWittig was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in silver in 1965, the Banner of Labor in 1969, the Medal Brotherhood in Arms in gold in 1970 and the Kampforden \u201eF\u00fcr Verdienste um Volk und Vaterland\u201c in gold.\nDeath\nWittig unexpectedly passed away in Potsdam in January 1976 at the age of 49. He was succeeded by his deputy G\u00fcnther Jahn.\nDuring the GDR era, a POS in today's Berlin district of Staaken (Spandau borough), the Potsdam Polytechnic Secondary School 45, and a street in the Waldstadt II residential area were named after him. His grave is located in an honor grove at the New Cemetery in Potsdam.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Reife Genossen\". Der Spiegel (in German). 1969-06-15. ISSN\u00a02195-1349.

    "Taiwanese actor\nPatrick Lee Pei-hsu (Chinese: \u674e\u6c9b\u65ed; born 7 November 1979) is a Taiwanese actor. He began his career on television and rose to prominence with his roles as Hao Kangde in The Fierce Wife (2010) and Shi Te-long in Office Girls (2011\u201312), followed by a lead role as Nakamura Kouhei in the period drama series Haru (2015). He has also appeared in the Singaporean crime series Gifted (2018), and is set to star in the upcoming French action film Weekend in Taipei (2024).\nEarly life and education\nLee was born on 7 November 1979 in Taiwan. He studied at the Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University and was a member of the school's dance club. He then attended Fu Jen Catholic University and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in textile design. He began working as a model during his university years.\nCareer\nWhile working as a model in his university years, Lee was spotted by talent agency EeLin Entertainment\u00a0 and signed as an artist following his graduation. He made his acting debut in 2002 with a minor role in the comedy series Hot College Students\u00a0. He received his first series regular role in the 2003 series 1 Asabulu and went on to take on supporting roles on television. He landed his first lead role in the 2005 medical drama Beauty Clinic\u00a0, and appeared in the 2008 and 2009 romantic comedy series Fated to Love You and My Queen.\nLee's breakout role came as Hao Kangde in the 2010 romance series The Fierce Wife, playing a cheating husband with a glib tongue. He later reprised the role in the 2012 spin-off film The Fierce Wife Final Episode\u00a0. Starting in 2011, Lee took on a lead role as Shi Te-long in the comedy series Office Girls, portraying a mean-spirited and sycophantic department store employee. This became one of Lee's most iconic roles, and his bilingual acting style of incorporating English words into Chinese dialogue became his signature. Lee had a small role as Brother Nuo in the 2012 Singaporean action film Imperfect, and received another lead role in the 2015 period drama Haru, playing the antagonistic Japanese detective Nakamura Kouhei. Lee subsequently landed main roles in the drama series People Life, Ocean Wild\u00a0 and the romance series Just For You\u00a0, as well as the Singaporean crime series Gifted.\nIn 2020, Lee left EeLin Entertainment and announced a career switch to become a bodybuilding coach. He signed with Catwalk Production House\u00a0 the following year to pursue a career in feature films. Lee starred in the 2023 Singaporean horror film Circle Line, and is set to appear in the 2024 French action film Weekend in Taipei.\nPersonal life\nLee began dating his The Fierce Wife co-star Janel Tsai in 2011, and they broke up in 2020 after Tsai revealed that their relationship had deteriorated due to her health problems that emerged in 2016. Lee announced his marriage with a Chinese-Thai woman in July 2022.\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f \u674e\u5e7c\u8ecd (21 March 2015). \"\u4e0d\u7529\u53e6\u4e00\u534a\u8521\u6dd1\u81fb\u3000\u674e\u6c9b\u65ed\u751c\u871c\u58c1\u549a\u738b\u6a02\u598d\" (in Chinese).

    "The Shaulladany family (010) is a small collisional asteroid family of at least 13 known asteroids, named for one of its members, the 16-kilometre (9.9\u00a0mi)-across asteroid 247341 Shaulladany (although its largest member is 37519 Amphios). It lies within the larger dynamical group of Jupiter trojans, a group of asteroids in an orbital resonance with Jupiter such that they stay about 60 degrees ahead of/behind the planet in its orbit at all times in the Lagrange points L4 and L5, with the Shaulladany family being part of the trailing cloud around L5, also known as the Trojan camp. All members of the family are dark (assumed to be C-type asteroids) with albedos of around 0.09.\nAn asteroid family is a group of physically related asteroids usually created by a collision with an original larger asteroid, with the fragments continuing on similar orbits to the original. This is distinct from a dynamical group in that the members of a dynamical group only share similar orbits because of gravitational interactions with planets, which concentrate asteroids in a particular orbital range. Members of the Shaulladany family are both part of the wider Trojan dynamical group, and fragments of 37519 Amphios. The family is considered a non-catastrophic asteroid family because 37519 Amphios, its largest member, makes up a majority of the family's total mass, rather than simply being the largest of a number of fragments each making up a small fraction of the original destroyed asteroid.\nLarge members\n\u00a0 37519 Amphios: 0.186 (49.5%)\n\u00a0 (76826) 2000 SW131: 0.0544 (14.5%)\n\u00a0 247341 Shaulladany: 0.0241 (6.4%)\n\u00a0 (291807) 2006 KG89: 0.0178 (4.7%)\n\u00a0 (337804) 2001 UN216: 0.0142 (3.8%)\n\u00a0 (338343) 2002 WY19: 0.0104 (2.8%)\n\u00a0 (486695) 2013 WP63: 0.0098 (2.6%)\n\u00a0 (376867) 2001 TN222: 0.00927 (2.5%)\n\u00a0 (420313) 2011 YQ62: 0.00902 (2.4%)\n\u00a0 (347099) 2010 HO21: 0.00865 (2.3%)\n\u00a0 all other members: 0.0321 (8.5%)\nMass distribution of the Shaulladany family (assuming similar densities)\nReferences\n^ Nesvorny, D.; Broz, M.; Carruba, V.

    "Swiss mountaineer (1981\u20142012)\nCedric H\u00e4hlen (September 19, 1981\u2014missing March 9, 2012) was a Swiss mountaineer. During his lifetime, he was the youngest European to climb K2, and would climb five eight-thousanders before age thirty.\nBiography\nCedric H\u00e4hlen began climbing in the Alps as a child. In his teens, he would spent 30 to 40 weekends a year on mountain tours. He developed his skills in climbing competitions for the Swiss Alpine Club, taking part in sixteen climbing competitions between 1995 and 2003.\nLater he began taking part in expeditions to climb eight-thousanders in the Himalayas and Karakoram.\nIn 2002, at age 19, he travelled to climb in South America. There, he made a number of ascents across Peru and Bolivia, including Huayna Potosi. Less than six months later, H\u00e4hlen made his first attempt to climb an eight-thousander, Shishapangma. H\u00e4hlen reached 7700 m before returning to base camp. On his first visit to Pakistan, H\u00e4hlen became captivated by the country, and would return to climb there again and again.\nIn 2004, he became the youngest European person to climb K2. The next year, he was part of a Swiss-German team that made the first probable ascent of Central Farol Peak (6,350 m) in the Masherbrum Mountains.\nIn 2006, H\u00e4hlen, alongside Hans Mitterer and Ueli Steck made the first ascent of the north face of Gasherbrum II East (7,772m), from China. At the time, the climb was called one of \"the finest achievements in the Karakoram\".\nBy the age of 30,  H\u00e4hlen had summitted five eight-thousanders and been on eleven expeditions. Between expeditions, he would return home to his work as a landscape gardener. In an effort to support himself and his climbing, in 2010, H\u00e4hlen began training to become a certified alpine guide. As a training guide, he brought an expedition of tourists to climb to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro in 2011.\nIn 2011, H\u00e4hlen was invited by Gerfried G\u00f6schl to take part in an expedition attempting the first winter ascent of Gasherbrum I. On March 9, 2012 the expedition team (H\u00e4hlen, along with Gerfried G\u00f6schl and Nisar Hussain Sadpara) lost contact with base camp after relying that they were 450m below base camp. Multiple search and rescue expeditions were launched for the missing climbers. Despite considerable efforts, no trace of the climbers has ever been found.\nDuring the expedition, a film crew was following the climb for a mountain film documentary. After the climbers were lost, the footage was turned into a tribute, Der letzte Weg, produced by Red Bull Media House.\nMountaineering\nSource:\n2003 - Shishapangma\n2004 - K2 8611 m\n2004 - Aconcagua\n2006 - Gasherbrum II East First ascent from China\n2006 - Broad Peak\n2011 - Kangchenjunga\n2011 - Kilimanjaro\n2012 - Gasherbrum I\nReferences\n^ a b Kramer, Pirmin (2014-02-14). \"Baden - Vor zwei Jahren verschollen: Nun erinnert ein Film an Cedric H\u00e4hlens letzte Tour\".

    "Dutch para-cyclist and swimmer\nMarieke van Soest (born 1987) is a Dutch para-swimmer and cyclist. In cycling, she competes on a tricycle.\nSporting career\nMarieke van Soest was born and raised in Nijkerk, the third child in a family with four children. She is a member of a Reformed district church that belongs to the Evangelical Church in the Netherlands. In 2014, she fell into a coma at the University Medical Center Utrecht due to an aneurysm, when she was actually there because of an infection in her ankle. Since she was already in hospital, an operation was able to save her life. Rehabilitation lasted two years and she had to have an artificial skull inserted. She is dependent on an electric wheelchair because she is paralyzed on one side.\nAfter her rehabilitation, van Soest devoted herself to swimming, which she had already done before her illness. She taught herself to move in the water with one arm and one leg, and she became Dutch champion in the individual medley in 2017 and 2018. Despite these achievements, the Royal Dutch Swimming Federation (KNZB) did not nominate her for the 2020 Summer Paralympics; she herself believes that she was given preference over athletes with less disabilities: \"You would have had to take the wheelchair with you and someone would have had to help me change for the swim.\"\nIn the spring of 2019, van Soest therefore decided to start cycling. To do this, the Royal Dutch Cycling Union initially loaned her a tricycle, which was not suitable for international competitions. In March 2020, she received a bike specially built for her by frame builder Ben de Ruiter.\nIn 2020 and 2021, van Soest became Dutch champion, and in 2021 she became European champion. In May 2022 she won three World Cups and two European Cups. In August 2022 she became (as the first Dutch woman) tricycle world champion in the road race and time trial, and in September 2022 Dutch champion in both disciplines.\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Stap voor stap grenzen verleggen\". nd.nl (in Dutch). 26 October 2019.

    "\nR\u00fcdiger Hell (born June 3, 1959) is a German plant biologist and distinguished professor at the Center for Organismal Studies (COS) at Heidelberg University, Germany.\nEducation and career\nHell studied biology at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt and obtained his doctorate in plant biology from the University of Cologne in 1989 under the supervision of Ludwig Bergmann\u00a0. He performed a postdoctoral fellowship in the research group of Wilhelm Gruissem\u00a0 in the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology at the University of California, Berkeley, USA, from 1990 to 1993. Subsequently, Hell was appointed as a senior researcher (C1) in the Department of Plant Physiology at the Ruhr University Bochum in Bochum, Germany.\nIn 1998, he completed his habilitation and obtained the venia legendi for Botany in Bochum. The same year, Hell moved to the Leibniz Institute for Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK)\u00a0, Gatersleben, Germany, where he was an independent group leader within the Department of Molecular Cell Biology until 2003.\nIn 2003, he became a full professor (C4) and chair at Heidelberg University as head of the Department of the Molecular Biology of Plants. Hell acted as Dean of the Faculty of Biosciences at Heidelberg University from 2005 to 2007 and again since 2022. Since 2019, he has been serving as an elected member of the Heidelberg University's academic senate.\nHell has been a member of the German Research Foundation's Review Board for plant sciences from 2016 to 2024 and is also active as a member of the German Society for Plant Sciences.\nResearch\nIn his research, Hell integrates biochemistry, cell biology and molecular genetics to answer physiological and organismal questions towards understanding of the adjustment growth of plants in different environments.\nHell's research focuses on the role of metabolism for driving growth in relation to developmental programs and changing environments. He developed the regulation of the metabolism of sulfur into a versatile tool to study plant nutrient sensing, growth control in general and abiotic stress responses. He discovered that the synthesis of the amino acid cysteine forms a metabolic hub for integration of resource availability in the soil (i.e. sulfate) and changing demand for energy and protein translation in response to photosynthesis and stresses, in particular water deficit and heavy metal resistance. He promoted research on the role of protein degradation that is determined by N-terminal protein modifications in the context of proteome stability during environmental stress.\nSelected publications\nHell, R., Mendel, RR., eds.

    "\nZ\u0259yzid Church is a church of the 10th-11th centuries, located in the village of Orta Z\u0259yzid, Shaki district. The building is registered by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Azerbaijan as a historical and architectural monument of local significance.\nThe Z\u0259yzid Church exhibits a cruciform architectural plan, wherein the arms of the cross are primarily rectangular, with the exception of the eastern arm. This eastern wing is distinguished by an apse with a semicircular configuration. The junctures of the cross are accentuated by pilasters featuring rectangular capitals. Projecting semicircular arches provide support to a circular entablature. Historically, this entablature sustained a drum and dome, although these structures are no longer extant.\nOn the church's northern wall, two layers of cladding have survived to this day along the entire wall. Traces of ancient frescoes can be seen on the coating.\nHistory\nAt the beginning of our era, the active propaganda and spread of Christianity in the territory of Caucasian Albania and its transformation into a state religion from the 4th century led to the construction of a large number of churches and monasteries.The study of temple and necropolis complexes, the determination of the periods to which they belong, made it possible to trace the process of strengthening Christian ideology in the territory of the Mountainous Caucasus, including North-West Azerbaijan.\nUp to 70 Christian churches and their remains have survived to this day in the rocky and hilly areas, as well as in the forests of the North-West region of Azerbaijan. These are mainly basilica architectural forms, single- or three-nave buildings.\nAmong the Christian churches of the region, the church located in the village of Orta Z\u0259yzid Shaki stands out with its cruciform plan. As a result of archaeological research and the study of the design features of the building, it was established that it dates back to the 5th-8th centuries. Also, architectural and archaeological studies have shown that all parts of the church were built in the same period.Sharf's excavations and studies conducted in several places inside the church also confirmed this conclusion. During the archaeological excavations on the territory of the church, various ceramic remains were discovered, dating back to the 2nd-6th and 8th-13th centuries. G. Mamedova refers to the fact that the church has more subtle architectural forms and decorative features compared to the Gedebey Church with similar characteristics, which suggests the possibility that it was built in a later period, at the latest in the 10th century.\nDecorative elements\nOn the church's northern wall, two layers of facing have survived to this day across the entire wall. Traces of ancient frescoes can be seen on the covering.\nAll of the cornice belts of the church that have survived to this day are decorated with identical complex carved patterns. Remains of decorative bas-relief and sculpture have survived to this day only along the edges of the window in the southern wing. The bas-relief covers all four sides of the window.\nOther buildings around the church\nIn the southwestern corner of the Z\u0259yzid Church are the ruins of a small building, presumably the priest's room.  Another building with a throne is located on the northern side of the Z\u0259yzid Church. The entrance and window of the building, presumably the church chapel (sovmaa), are on the eastern wall.\nOn the northwestern side of the church is another seriously damaged building. This building was destroyed to the ground. Not far from the church is an early medieval Christian cemetery and tombstones.\nReferences\n^ \"D\u00fcnya \u0259h\u0259miyy\u0259tli da\u015f\u0131nmaz tarix v\u0259 m\u0259d\u0259niyy\u0259t abid\u0259l\u0259rinin siyah\u0131s\u0131\" (PDF).

    "19th-century Spanish woman bullfighter\nFor the Colombian model, film and television actress, see Martina Garc\u00eda.\nMarta Martina Garc\u00eda (Spanish: ; 25 July 1814 \u2013 27 July 1882) was a 19th-century Spanish bullfighter known as \"Lagartijo mujeril\" (\"Womanly Lizard\") or \"La Martina\". She dominated all types of bullfighting, and stood out for being one of the few women bullfighters in her time who fought bulls alongside men. Antonio Garc\u00eda-Ramos y V\u00e1zquez in Veinte temas taurinos writes that Francisco Arjona Herrera, known as \"C\u00fachares\", stands out among them.\nDiscrepancies\nSome writers are of the opinion that Martina Garc\u00eda was born in Guillena near Seville, while others, like Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Coss\u00edo in his work Los toros, states that her birthplace was Ciempozuelos; Pascual Mill\u00e1n in his work Los novillos mentions that Garc\u00eda's point of origin was Colmenar de Oreja, near Madrid and Muriel Feiner in La mujer en el mundo del toro repeats Pascual Mill\u00e1n's assertion that Colmenar de Oreja was the bullfighter's birthplace.\nBiography\nGarc\u00eda was orphaned in 1821. In 1828 she moved to Madrid where she worked as a childminder and later, she busied herself as a cook at a bar on Madrid's Calle de Hortaleza, frequented by employees of the old Puerta de Alcal\u00e1 bullring, who encouraged her to become a bullfighter.\nOn 15 January 1837, Garc\u00eda had her d\u00e9but as a banderillera, dressed as a working-class woman, with a short skirt and no pants. On 5 November of the same year, she did a repeat performance as a banderillera together with Rosa Inard, and picadoras Magdalena Garc\u00eda and Antonia Garc\u00eda; for this performance, Martina Garc\u00eda earned two hundred reales. On Christmas Day, there was another repeat performance with the same women sharing the billing.\nOn 18 February 1838, Garc\u00eda fought for the first time as a matadora against fighting bulls as a mojiganga (a pantomime representation which was done at the time before novilladas whose origin was in the 16th century) accompanied by her own cuadrilla (team of banderilleras and picadoras) which was made up wholly of women such as Rosa Inard and Celedonia Marina, and once again she earned two hundred reales for her efforts. On 11 March 1838, she took part in Madrid in a novillada embolada (meaning that a yearling bull's horns were tipped with wooden balls) with the mojigangas representing \"The Doctor and the Nurse\", afterwards assisting with her cape in the fight with a yearling bull. She appeared shortly thereafter in another novillada playing Dulcinea del Toboso in a representation of Don Quijote de la Mancha.\nOn 26 January 1845, Garc\u00eda, dressed in the old French style, shared billing with Teresa and Magdalena Garc\u00eda, Rosa Inard and Manuela Renaud as banderilleras. She performed again in Madrid in 1846 with the women mojiganga bullfighters. On 4 February 1849, she performed in Madrid clad in a suit of lights, sharing billing with the bullfighter Mar\u00eda, \"La Gitana Cantarina\" (\"The Gipsy Woman Singer\"). Garc\u00eda's last performance there was on 16 August 1874 with Jos\u00e9 Giraldez, \"Jaqueta\", in the last celebration held at the now vanished Puerta de Alcal\u00e1 bullring\u00a0\u2014 which was torn down the next day. Critics at the time agreed that she had been intrepid and serene when facing bulls.\nOn 16 April 1874, Garc\u00eda did her last mojiganga bullfight with Juana L\u00f3pez and Tomasa Prieto as picadoras\u00a0\u2013 riding donkeys rather than the customary horses\u00a0\u2013 and Rosa Campos along with Javiera Bidaurre as banderilleras; Garc\u00eda herself was the matadora.\nGarc\u00eda forwent any apoderado (\"manager\" or \"agent\") who could have worked out contracts for her. For her abilities, the bullfighter was compared to male bullfighter Lagartijo (1841\u20131900) according to what Pascual Mill\u00e1n wrote in his work Los novillos (\"The Bull Calves\"). Garc\u00eda's bullfighting career has been compared to bullfighter Pedro Romero's (1754\u20131839) for its length, even though her own career, which lasted some forty years, was quite a bit longer than his. Despite having retired some months earlier she once again put herself before a bull on 7 November 1874, when she was sixty years old. However, she definitively retired from the bullring in 1880 at the age of sixty-six.\nGarc\u00eda was targeted by all kinds of detractors, from journalists to bullfighting writers. The critic Federico Domingu\u00edn, for instance, called her an \"unfortunate matadora and old woman\". Natalio Rivas, on the other hand, said that her long career was steeped in great courage, if little in the way of artistry.\nShe fought yearling bulls, toros embolados and bare-horned bulls; she dominated different aspects of bullfighting with skill and fluency. She fought alongside men in mixed corridas, among them C\u00fachares, who mentioned her courage and what little knowledge the bullfighter had of bulls. Pascual Mill\u00e1n spoke of her as an institution, and she was also mentioned by Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s. Conserved at the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a is the document in which Garc\u00eda sought permission to fight bu",

The attacker, a 35-year-old Palestinian man from Salfit, West Bank, was later shot and killed by a police officer.\nHamas issued a statement mourning the perpetrator, describing him as a \"martyred hero.\"\nAttack\nThe attack, which involved a series of stabbings, took place at three different locations in Holon, approximately 500 meters apart. It began at the entrance of a park on Moshe Dayan Street, where an elderly couple was enjoying their daily walk. The assailant killed the woman and wounded her husband. He then proceeded to a nearby bus stop adjacent to a gas station, where he critically wounded a man in his 80s, who later succumbed to his injuries at the hospital. The final victim, a 26-year-old man, was stabbed at a bus parking lot on Dan Shomron Street. The attacker was ultimately shot dead by a police operations officer from the Holon police station.\nVictims\nSixty-six-year-old Rina Daniv was pronounced dead at the scene. Avraham Somechi, a man in his eighties, succumbed to his wounds after being transported to Wolfson Medical Center. Two others were injured: a 26-year-old man and Daniv's husband, a 66-year-old man.\nPerpetrator\nThe perpetrator was Ammar Razek Kamel Odeh, a 35-year-old Palestinian man from the West Bank town of Salfit, who entered Israel without a permit. He was not affiliated with any terrorist organizations, had a history of drug rehabilitation, and had been imprisoned multiple times. The investigation, conducted by the Tel Aviv District Police and Shin Bet, is examining his activities since his entry, potential assistance from smugglers, and whether the attack was premeditated or spontaneous.\nAftermath\nOfficial responses\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a cabinet meeting that \"this morning there was a murderous terrorist attack in Holon. I send my condolences to the families of the murdered and best wishes for a speedy recovery to the injured.\" Netanyahu praised the police officers who killed the attacker, adding \"we will reckon with everyone who cooperated with him.\"\nIsrael's Minister for State Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited the site of the attack and stated, \"I share in the grief of the families and wish a full recovery to the wounded. Our war is not only against Iran but also here in the streets.\" He reiterated his call for Israelis to arm themselves.\nFollowing the attack, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) mapped the perpetrator's house for demolition.\nPalestinian response\nPalestinian militant groups celebrated the attack. Hamas issued a statement mourning the perpetrator, describing him as a \"martyred hero.\" The statement read, \"Hamas views this act as a natural response to ongoing Israeli occupation crimes against the Palestinian people, including brutal acts in Gaza, escalating violations in the West Bank, and the assassination of movement leader Ismail Haniyeh.\" The Popular Resistance Committees, a coalition of Palestinian factions, as well as the Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, posted messages of support on their social media channels.\nReferences\n^ a b c d Fabian, Emanuel (2024-08-04). \"Two dead, 2 hurt in terror stabbing spree in Holon; Palestinian attacker shot by police\".

    "American journalist (born 1993)\nRachel V. Scott (born May 5, 1993) is an American journalist, currently serving as the senior congressional correspondent for ABC News.\nEarly life\nScott was raised in Diamond Bar, California where she graduated from Diamond Bar High School in 2011. In 2012, she was chosen as an intern in the White House Internship Program during the Barack Obama presidency.\nScott applied as an undergraduate for University of Southern California (USC) but her admission was turned down. She stated, \"Though I couldn't see it at the time, that rejection letter was actually pushing me closer to new opportunities, to a dream I had not yet realized.\" She later enrolled into the University of California, Irvine (UCI), and transferred into USC. In 2015, Scott graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.\nCareer\nIn 2016, Scott was hired as a production associate for ABC News Live. While serving as a producer for GMA Digital, she also became an on-air correspondent for the ABC news affiliate WTNH in New Haven, where she reported the weekend news. On July 20, 2020, she was promoted as ABC News' White House correspondent and D.C. correspondent. Scott became a congressional correspondent covering Capitol Hill, and during her first week on the job, she reported the January 6 United States Capitol attack.\nIn June 2021, Scott received media attention for asking Russian President Vladimir Putin: \"The list of your political opponents who are dead, imprisoned or jailed is long ... what are you so afraid of?\" A year later, in 2022, she was awarded the News and Documentary Emmy Award for Outstanding Emerging Journalist, which was the first year the category was introduced.\nIn January 2023, Scott was promoted as the network's senior congressional correspondent. On July 13, 2024, Scott was reporting at the campaign rally event, where the attempted assassination on Donald Trump occurred in Butler, Pennsylvania.\nOn July 31, 2024, Donald Trump arrived at an interview panel before the National Association of Black Journalists, where he was interviewed by Scott, Harris Faulkner of Fox News, and Semafor's Kadia Goba. Scott began her interview by repeating Trump's past statements about Black and other women of color leaders, his support of January 6 rioters, and his criticism towards diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Trump replied Scott's line of questioning was \"a very rude introduction,\" and claimed that Scott arrived 35 minutes late to the interview. Entertainment Weekly went on to report that a source at the event confirmed that the start time was actually delayed because Trump was demanding that the NABJ not do a live fact-check of his answers. The interview received significant media attention regarding Trump's remarks towards Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris. Trump responded, \"I didn't know  was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?\"\nPersonal life\nIn January 2024, Scott announced her marital engagement to Elliot Smith.\nReferences\n^ a b Clack, Erin (January 8, 2024). \"'Good Morning America's Rachel Scott Is Engaged: 'Can't Stop Smiling'\".

Residing in Doha, Qatar, the chairman serves as a figurehead for Hamas during Palestinian elections and becomes the central leader in the resistance against Israeli occupation. Additionally, he plays a crucial role in foreign relations, leading negotiations with Israeli officials regarding peace processes, fostering reconciliation with Fatah, and enhancing ties with other Middle Eastern countries.\nHistory\nMain article: History of Hamas\nAhmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas, become the first chairman of the Hamas Shura Council and de facto leader of Hamas from December 1987 until March 2004. Following his assassination, his deputy, Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi took over for only 15 days before he was assassinated by Israel.\nThe current chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau at that time, Khalid Mashal, took over Hamas leadership and declare as the overall and de facto leader of Hamas since April 2004. Although he hold this position since 1996, he was not the overall leader of Hamas since the chairman of the Hamas Shura Council at that time considered as the de facto leader. Hamas elected Mousa Abu Marzook, the previous political bureau's chairman, as the deputy chairman of Hamas Political Bureau in January 1997.\nIn May 2017, Ismail Haniyeh, the deputy chairman of Hamas Political Bureau, was elected by the Hamas Shura Council as the chairman of Hamas Political Bureau. Hamas also elected Saleh al-Arouri as the deputy chairman of Hamas Political Bureau. However, Al-Arouri was assassinated by Israeli strike in January 2024. Six month later, Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran while attending for the inauguration ceremony of the President of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian.\nOn 1 August 2024, Khaled Mashal, the then-chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau, was expected to lead Hamas again.\nOn 5 August 2024, Abu Omar Hassan was expected to become the next chairman of Hamas Political Bureau. Before this, he serving as the chairman of the Hamas Shura Council from October 2023, succeeded Osama Mazini, after his killing on 16 October 2023 by Israeli strike.\nHowever, on 6 August 2024, Yahya Sinwar officially appointed as the next chairman of Hamas Political Bureau and de facto leader of Hamas after six days of assassination of his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh. The announcement came after the Shura Council, the body that elects Hamas's politburo, voted unanimously to choose Sinwar as the new leader, in what was described by a Hamas official as a \"message of defiance to Israel\". Khalil al-Hayya was selected as the deputy chairman of Hamas Political Bureau on the same day. Previously, Al-Hayya was the deputy leader of Hamas government in the Gaza Strip.\nStructure of organisation and selection\nHamas inherited a tripartite organization of social services, religious instruction, and military operations overseen by a Shura Council. It used to have four different roles: \na security service (Arabic: Jehaz Aman);\na military division for acquiring weapons and conducting operations (Arabic: Al-Mujahideen al Filastinun);\na charitable social welfare division (Arabic: Dawah); and\na media branch (Arabic: A'alam).\nHamas is led both internally, in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and externally, by two groups: Kuwaiti organization (Kuwaidi), led by Khaled Mashal, and a Gaza group led by Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, who was exiled first to Damascus subsequently to Egypt. Following its leader Mashal's decision to demand that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait and defy Yasser Arafat's decision to support Saddam Hussein in the invasion, the Kuwaiti group of Palestinian exiles started to receive substantial money from the Gulf States. Ismail Haniyeh was selected by the Hamas Shura Council in May 2017 to succeed Mashal as the leader of Hamas.\nThe organization's operational actions are concealed by a veil of secrecy, making its actual structure unclear.

    "Street in Havana, Cuba\nThe Quinta Avenida (Fifth Avenue) is one of the main roads of the municipality of Playa in Havana, Cuba. The avenue is located in the ward of Miramar, where it's also called the Avenida de las Am\u00e9ricas (Avenue of the Americas).\nLocation\nwalk of the Quinta Avenida.The avenue extends from the tunnel that connects it with Calle Calzada and the Malec\u00f3n, in El Vedado, to the Santa Ana River, in the Santa Fe area, at the western end of the city. Where it becomes the Carretera Panamericana and reaches the city of Mariel, in Artemisa Province. Its layout turned out to be a key factor for the development and flowering of the Miramar distribution, with also the Country Club Park and the beach of Marianao, which is located between Miramar and the Country (current Siboney). The bourgeoisie of Havana progressively moved from places such as the Paseo del Prado, in the historic center and built their mansions and palaces further west, arriving with Miramar to cross the Almendares River, with the first use of a bridge, and later of two road tunnels.\nDesign\nJesus de Miramar, Quinta Avenida and Calle 82\nThe design of the Quinta Avienda was in charge of engineer Luis Morales y Pedroso (graduated in 1904 from Columbia University) and president of the firm Morales y Mata arquitectos (1908\u20131917). The Quinta Avienda was part of the plan of Miramar laid out on the limits of the finca La Miranda owned by lawyer Don Manuel Jos\u00e9 Morales y Martin (father of Luis Morales and Pedroso). The original layout of the Quinta Avenida with a central pedestrian promenade was designed and drawn between Calle 0 and Calle 42 and in the continuity of Calle Calzada of Vedado, from the foreground of engineer Luis Morales and Pedroso. This plan was presented by Manuel Jos\u00e9 Morales and Martin in 1908 for a license application in the Municipality of Marianao. The license of the project was finally approved in 1911, with the signature of Luis Morales and Pedroso as a designer. It was only in 1921 and at the request of the new owners of the cast; Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Pote and Ramon Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza, that the American architect John H. Duncan, author of the monument to Ulysses S. Grant, designed the Bell Tower on Quinta Avienda and Calle. In the original urban plan of Luis Morales Pedroso, the use of measures of 100 to 200 meters was already defined for blocks with proportions similar to the Fifth Avenue, in Manhattan and in alignment with the streets of the neighboring Vedado. Despite the fact that it has a central tree-lined promenade, Quinta Avienda is not a homogeneous road; it changes for sections according to its architecture and the time of construction. The section least similar to the rest is between the roundabouts of Calle 112 and Calle 120.\nAttractions\nClock of the Quinta Avenida\nThe road starts with the Fountain of the Americas. Next attraction found is the clock, a symbol of the municipality of Playa. At the Calle 42 is La Copa, which was donated by Carlos Miguel de C\u00e9spedes, who was Minister of Public Works of the president Gerardo Machado.\nConey Island Park (or the Isla del Coco), is one of the first theme parks in Cuba and in the Americas, is visited by thousands of people every day. The Jes\u00fas de Miramar Church, the largest Catholic temple in the country, is another notable place of interest.\nThe most notable thing about the avenue is the succession of diplomatic headquarters around the world, which has earned it the qualifier of Avenue of the Embassies.\nOffices of Sol Melia en the Quinta Avenida\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Diario Juventud Rebelde Digital. \"La Quinta Avenida\" (in Spanish).

    "Country house in Weston under Penyard, Herefordshire\nBollitree Castle is an historic site on the edge of the village of Weston under Penyard, Herefordshire, England. The site consists of Bollitree Castle farmhouse, two barns, a dovecote, a gate, and a series of mock castellated curtain walls from which the site takes its name. Bollitree Castle Farmhouse is a Grade II* listed building, one of the barns, which contains genuine medieval fragments, is listed at the highest grade, Grade I, while the other structures have their own Grade II listings.\nHistory\nThere is architecture evidence of habitation at Bollitree Castle from medieval times. In the 15th century, the estate was owned by the Merryk family, of whom the most notable member was Richard Amerike (c. 1440\u20131503), a Bristol-based merchant whose name has been suggested as the origin of America although this is disputed. The castle farmhouse dates from c.1700. Later in the 18th century, the major transformation of the farmhouse and the wider site was undertaken. Local tradition suggests this was carried out by a Thomas Merrick, in pursuit of a Spanish woman whom he wanted to marry and who had indicated that she wished to live in a castle, but there is little documentary evidence for this. Historic England records the sham castle fortifications, but posits no suggestion as to their builder's motivations.\nBollitree is owned by Richard Hammond, the television presenter, who bought the castle in 2012. In 2023, redevelopment plans submitted by Hammond were turned down by Herefordshire County Council following objections from the Georgian Group.\nArchitecture and description\nThe main barn at Bollitree, with the bulk of the castellated curtain walls, contains some genuine medieval fragments, and is listed at Grade I. The farmhouse, which forms the main residence on the site, is listed at Grade II*. Another ancillary agricultural building, a further barn, a dovecote, and a gate in a garden wall are listed at Grade II.\nGallery\nMock castellated curtain walls and a fake moat\nCorner tower\nCurtain wall\nNotes\n^ There are many alternative spellings, including ap Meryk and Merrick\n^ Some sources mistakenly suggest that a previous owner of Bollitree Castle was the singer, Marc Bolan. Bolan in fact owned the Old Rectory, which stands to the south of Bollitree, on Rectory Lane.\nReferences\n^ a b Historic England. \"Barn on west side of farmyard and curtain wall enclosing yard at Bollitree Castle\u00a0(Grade I) (1296781)\".

Discussions about the scope of the project are still ongoing, although training already begun as of late July.\nOrganization\nThe units are planned to be trained by Western military advisors and have high quality standards, including modern military equipment financed by Poland.\nPoland, along Lithuania and other EU allies, will train the volunteers on Polish training grounds.\nAll administrative work and recruitment is conducted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, without Polish involvement.\nAfter conclusion of service in the warzone, volunteers would be allowed to return and stay in Poland.\nOutlook\nPoland has called on other European nations to provide similar schemes.\nThe Czech Republic expressed interest in the scheme and will consider involvement in the future, according to a ministry spokesman.

Votes cast in the district also count towards the calculation of proportional representation (\"plurinominal\") deputies elected from the third region.\nDistrict territory\nUnder the 2022 districting plan, which is to be used for the 2024, 2027 and 2030 federal elections, the ninth district covers 42 municipalities in the state's coastal region.\nThe district's head town (cabecera distrital), where results from individual polling stations are gathered together and collated, is the resort city of Puerto Escondido in the district of Juquila.\nWith Indigenous and Afrodescendent inhabitants accounting for over 78% of its population, it is classified by the National Electoral Institute (INE) as an indigenous district.\nPrevious districting schemes\n2017\u20132022\nOaxaca's 11th district was dissolved in the 2017 redistricting process. Under the 2017 to 2022 scheme, the ninth district had its head town at the city of Puerto Escondido and it covered 42 municipalities.\n2005\u20132017\nBetween 2005 and 2017, the ninth district comprised 60 municipalities and had its head town at the city of Santa Luc\u00eda del Camino in the Valles Centrales region.\n1996\u20132005\nBetween 1996 and 2017, Oaxaca's seat allocation was increased to 11. Under the 1996 districting plan, the head town was moved to the city of Zimatl\u00e1n de \u00c1lvarez in the west of the Valles Centrales region.\n1978\u20131996\nThe districting scheme in force from 1978 to 1996 was the result of the 1977 electoral reforms, which increased the number of single-member seats in the Chamber of Deputies from 196 to 300. Under that plan, Oaxaca's seat allocation rose from nine to ten. The ninth district had its head town at Ejutla de Crespo in the state's Valles Centrales region.\nDeputies returned to Congress\nNotes\n^ Oaxaca accounts for 3.3% of the country's population and 4.8% of its surface area, but it contains almost a quarter of its municipalities: 570 out of 2,446.\n^ D\u00edaz Pimentel resigned his seat on 17 September 2001.\nReferences\n^ \"How Mexico Elects Its Leaders \u2014 The Rules\".

    "American restauranteur (1948\u20132024)\nGlen Yoshiaki Gondo (1948 \u2013 July 1, 2024) was an American businessman, restauranteur, and cultural advocate. Gondo, whose parents opened the first Japanese restaurant and sushi bar in Houston, Texas, is credited with popularizing Japanese cuisine and culture in the city. In 1993, Gondo founded the Japan Festival of Houston, a free annual event which showcases Japanese culture. The Japan Festival is now one of the largest Japanese cultural festivals in the United States.\nGondo transitioned to catering in the 1990s. His family-owned company, Tokyo Gardens Catering, supplies Sushiya brand sushi to H-E-B, a supermarket and now operates sushi kiosks in more than 290 supermarkets across Texas.\nBiography\nEarly life\nGondo was born in 1948 in Los Angeles, California, to Japanese-immigrant parents, Eugene and Hisako Gondo. His parents had been forcibly relocated and imprisoned during the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Shortly after his birth, the Gondo family moved to Watsonville, California, where he was raised as a child. He then moved with his parents to Dallas, Texas, where they opened a Japanese restaurant.\nThe family moved again, this time to Houston in 1962. In 1966, his parents opened Tokyo Gardens restaurant, located at 4701 Westheimer Road, the first Japanese restaurant and sushi bar in Houston. The family-owned restaurant also introduced aspects of Japanese culture which were new to the city. Tokyo Gardens incorporated elements of Japanese architecture, cultural performances and a koi pond into the space.\nGlen Gondo married his wife, Kathleen, in 1973.\nCareer\nHe began catering his own events and parties separate from his parents' business. By 1975, Gondo owned small sushi bars inside eight Fiesta Mart locations. Fiesta Mart, a regional supermarket chain, later discontinued Gondo's sushi bars. Glen and Kathy Gondo then moved to California, where he worked in the frozen food industry. Following two years in California, they moved to New York City, where Gondo joined his family's jewelry business.\nIn 1984, Gondo and his family moved permanently from New York City to Houston and adopted the city as his hometown. He also took over the family restaurant from his parents beginning in 1984. Gondo owned and operated the restaurant for 14 years until its closure in 1998.\nHe then transitioned the family business into catering, renaming it Tokyo Gardens Catering, short for Tokyo Gardens Catering and Sushic, LLC. Gondo provided catering for universities regionally, as well as Continental Airlines, which was headquartered in Houston and offered flights to Japan. In 2002, Gondo's Tokyo Gardens Catering began supplying sushi to the H-E-B supermarket chain under the \"Sushiya\" brand name at the invitation of then H-E-B president, Martin Otto. Gondo's first Sushiya sushi bar opened at the H-E-B location in Friendswood, Texas. His company's Sushiya sushi kiosks now operate in more than 290 H-E-B supermarkets across Texas, as of 2024. (His son, Robert Gondo, now heads the family's catering business after his father's retirement.) Gondo also started an international trade consulting business and opened several stores at George Bush Intercontinental Airport.\nGondo has been credited with pioneering Japanese culture in Houston as a longtime community leader in the city's Japanese and Japanese American community. In 1987, Gondo was elected to the board of directors of the Japan America Society of Houston (JASH) and joined the organization's membership committee beginning in 1988. He then served as vice president for Special Events at JASH from 1989 until 1992, when he was appointed President of the Japan America Society of Houston. He served as president from 1992 to 1999. In 1999, Gondo became JASH's Vice President of Business Initiatives and then the co-chair of its advisory committee. He organizaed a Mayor's Challenge baseball game between Houston and its Japanese sister city, Chiba City, to mark the 2000 Millennium Matsuri. Gondo was re-elected as President of the Japan America Society of Houston in 2005. He served his second term as JASH president from 2006 until 2010, when he retired from the JASH leadership. However, he remained active with JASH for the rest of his life. Gondo also served on the boards of other organizations, including the Texas Asia Society.\nGondo's election as President of the Japan America Society of Houston in 1992 coincided with JASH's 25th silver anniversary. At the time, Houston had just completed the Japanese Garden in Hermann Park in 1992. Glen Gondo conceived the idea of holding a Japan Festival in Hermann Park as a way to showcase the new Japanese Garden to the community. Gondo pitched the idea to Houston Mayor Bob Lanier and the city government, who allowed the Japan Festival to utilize Hermann Park. The first Japan Festival of Houston, which was founded by Glen Gondo through his work as JASH president, was held in the park in 1993. The fr",

    "Scarboro Beach Park was a lakeside amusement park in the the Beaches neighbourhood of Toronto from 1907 until 1925. The park was originally in East Toronto until its annexation by the City of Toronto in 1908. \nMap of East Toronto in 1908, just prior to being annexed to Toronto. showing Scarboro Beach Park on the shore of Lake Ontario.\nThe park operated on a 40 acre-site south of Queen Street East to Lake Ontario between Leuty and MacLean avenues It succeeded two east end trolley parks, Victoria Park (1878\u20131906) and Munro Park (1896\u20131906), which had closed the previous year.\nThe park was founded by Harry and Mabel Dorsey who purchased the site from the Sisters of St. Joseph for $165,000 in 1906. It has been the site of the Order's House of Providence farm since the 1890s. The Toronto Railway Company purchased it in 1913 and invested and expanded it as well as extending the TRC's streetcar network to reach the grounds, making it a trolley park. Previously, Toronto residents had reached the park using a steamship service from the Toronto Harbour at the foot of Yonge Street.\nThe amusement park was built at a cost of $600,000 and opened June 1, 1907. It was modelled on Coney Island's Luna Park and offered over a hundred attractions including various rides such as a Shoot the Chutes water ride, a Tunnel of Love, a roller coaster billed as a scenic train, fun houses, aerial swings, an athletic field that hosted sporting events and was the home field for a lacrosse team, and other attractions such as a freak show, daredevil acts, bathing\nand dance pavilions, band concerts and other features. In 1909, the park was the site of the first public flight in Canada when Charles F. Willard took off from Scarboro Beach Park on September 7, 1909.\nThe park closed for the last time on Septebmber 12, 1925 after 19 seasons. The Toronto Railway Company's streetcar franchise with the city had ended in 1921 with the creation of the Toronto Transportation Commission. TRC sold its assets to the city in 1924 but the city refused to include the amusement park in the deal so it was purchased instead by the Provident Investment Company which demolished the park and replaced it with a residential subdivision. Scarboro Beach Boulevard in that subdivision is named after the park.\nSee also\nHanlan's Point Amusement Park - a similar facility operating on the Toronto Islands in the same period\nSunnyside Amusement Park - opened in Toronto's west end in 2922\nReferences\n^ Myrvold, Barbara. \"Building Beaches Branch, Toronto Public Library, 1910-1916\" (PDF).

    "Canadian gridiron football coach (1878\u20131960)\nHarry Crawford Griffith (September 19, 1878 \u2013 December 9, 1960) was a Canadian football player, coach, and administrator who was the head coach of the Toronto Varsity for three seasons and also served as president of the Canadian Rugby Union. He won the first two Grey Cup games as head coach of Toronto Varsity and served as a coach and headmaster for Ridley College. He was an inaugural member of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame and was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. \nEarly life\nGriffith attended Ridley College in St. Catharines where he played at quarterback for the school's football team. He later attended Trinity College in Toronto where continued to play at quarterback.\nCoaching career\nAfter obtaining his degree from Trinity College, Griffith returned to Ridley College in 1899 where he was a teacher and a coach. After developing his coaching style with the Ridley football team, he joined the Toronto Varsity football team as their head coach in 1907 while working for Trinity College as a French professor. In 1908, he led Varsity to an Intercollegiate Rugby Football Union Yates Cup championship, but lost the 1908 Dominion Championship to the Hamilton Tigers.\nIn 1909, Griffith led Varsity to a 6\u20130 regular season record, capturing their second consecutive Intercollegiate title, and appearing in their second consecutive Dominion Championship and the first to be awarded the Grey Cup. He led Varsity to a definitive 26\u20136 victory over Toronto Parkdale to claim a victory in the 1st Grey Cup. In the following season, Griffith again led Varsity to an undefeated season, as the team repeated as Grey Cup champions and defeated the Hamilton Tigers in the 2nd Grey Cup by a score of 16\u20137.\nGriffith returned to Ridley College in 1911 and, over his new tenure with the school, coached the Ridley football team to 22 Little Big Four titles.

    "Archaeological site in Shaki, Azerbaijan\nTepeba\u015f\u0131 Necropolis is a burial monument of the Iron Age and Antiquity located in the \u018fyri\u00e7ay in the village of Faz\u0131l in the Shaki District of Azerbaijan. The monument, first recorded in 1984, plays the role of an important source reflecting the history of the Iron Age and Caucasian Albania.\nGeographical location\nTepeba\u015f\u0131 Monument is located on a hill in the southern part of Faz\u0131l village of Shaki district, 100\u2013120 m west of the village of the same name. Tepeba\u015f\u0131 is a horseshoe-shaped hill that extends from northeast to southwest, ends with \u018fyri\u00e7ay in the southwest, and continues with the Great Plain on the east, northeast, and on the southern side. It borders on depressions, swamps, and \u018fyri\u00e7ay in the east and southeast.\nArchaeological excavations in Tepeba\u015f\u0131\nArchaeological research conducted at the Tepeba\u015f\u0131 site\nThe Tepeba\u015f\u0131 monument was first recorded by archaeologist Nasib Mukhtarov in 1984. Over the next 20 years, rescue and large-scale field research was carried out at the monument. Research has proven that the monument is a necropolis dating back to the Late Bronze Age \u2013 Iron Age and Antiquity. Long-term research has shown that the main burials at the Tepeba\u015f\u0131 monument were in pits and earthen graves. The deceased were buried on their right or left side, partially curled up. In some graves, the deceased was not buried entirely, but only individual parts were buried in the grave. The direction of the graves is predominantly northwest. The depth of the graves varies from 45 to 165\u00a0cm.\nThe \"rich\" graves here are dug deeper and their depth is consistently recorded as 160\u00a0cm (63\u00a0in). The dimensions of such graves are also large: 200\u2013360\u00a0cm (79\u2013142\u00a0in) long and 120\u2013180\u00a0cm (47\u201371\u00a0in) wide. The distance between the graves was small: 40\u2013100\u00a0cm (16\u201339\u00a0in). Although no fireplaces were found in the graves, large and small pieces of coal and layers of ash can be found throughout the grave. Presumably, layers of ash and coal are sprinkled during the burial ritual. In 1996, employees of the Institute of Archeology and Ethnography of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan, operating in Shaki, created an underground labyrinth museum on the territory of the monument called \"The World of Eternal Silence\". The main feature of the museum is that the graves discovered during the study of the Tepeba\u015f\u0131 monument are kept in their places and exhibited there.\nIn 2019\u20132020, archaeological research at the site was continued by the Shaki Archaeological Expedition, led by Dr. Zaur Gasanov and prominent Kazakhstani archaeologist Zainolly Samashev. The finds discovered during the excavations make it possible to trace the transition from one period to another \u2013 from the Iron Age to antiquity.\nReferences\n^ a b Alm\u0259mm\u0259dov, X\u0259qani (2006).

    "Cuban revolutionary (1834-1869)\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Castillo and the second or maternal family name is  Agramonte.\n\u00c1ngel del Castillo y Agramonte (August 14, 1834 - September 8, 1869) was a Cuban revolutionary and military general who was killed during the Ten Years' War in Cuba.\nEarly life\n\u00c1ngel del Castillo y Agramonte was born in Puerto Pr\u00edncipe (now Camag\u00fcey), Spanish Cuba on August 14, 1834. As a member of a distinguished family, he was a wealthy planter on the Cuban island.\nAfter finishing his dentistry studies in the United States in the mid-1850s, he returned to Cuba.\nTen Years' War\nAfter the revolutionary Cry of Yara and uprising led by Cespedes on October 10, 1868, Castillo and many other figures of Camag\u00fcey injected themselves into the Ten Years' War.\nLas Clavellinas Uprising\nCastillo was involved in the Las Clavellinas Uprising during Camag\u00fcey's armed revolt in November 1868. As coordinated by Cisneros Betancourt, the trusted allies of Eduardo Agramonte Pi\u00f1a were summoned to meet in the early hours of the morning. 76 Cuban patriots met at the Las Clavellinas river, three miles from Camag\u00fcey, and organized for battle on November 4, 1868. \u00c1ngel del Castillo, Jer\u00f3nimo Boza Agramonte, Adolfo Varona y de la Pera, and Salvador Cisneros Betancourt, among others assembled at the stream. Castillo and his brother freed their slaves to join the fight. While Jer\u00f3nimo Boza Agramonte assumed command as the superior chief, Col. Agramonte Pi\u00f1a divided the Cuban insurgents into several platoons.\nBattle of Bonilla\nDuring the Battle of Bonilla in Minas on November 28, 1868, insurgent forces commanded by \u00c1ngel del Castillo and Bernab\u00e9 Varona routed a Spanish regiment led by Blas Villate, who retreated to Nuevitas. Shortly after, he engaged in another skirmish with Villate, Count of Valmaseda.\nAfter C\u00e9spedes assumed the presidency in April 1869, Castillo was named colonel of the 2nd Brigade, under Maj. Gen. Ignacio Agramonte's Camag\u00fcey division in Manuel de Quesada's Cuban Liberation Army.\nBattle of Las Minas\n\u00c1ngel del Castillo participated in the Battle of Las Minas in May 1869, where he and Manuel de Quesada gathered over 4,000 troops and established a stronghold beyond Las Minas. Gen. Juan de Lesca launched an assault, leading to Salvador Cisneros Betancourt coming to their aid, and they successfully repelled the attack.\nDeath\n\u00c1ngel del Castillo died on September 8, 1869, while assaulting Fort L\u00e1zaro L\u00f3pez in Ciego de \u00c1vila, Ciego de \u00c1vila Province.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Cuba Rediscovered: Searching for Cuba's future in the home of my ancestors | The Seattle Times\". projects.seattletimes.com.

    "\nThe Illawarra Grevillea Park is a botanical garden located in Bulli on the south coast of New South Wales, Australia.\nOpened in 1993 by professional gardener Ray Brown, it is notable for its extensive collection of grevilleas, both cultivars and naturally occurring species. It also features many other plants from all over Australia as well as a naturally-occurring rainforest, a small chapel, public toilets, parking and picnic facilities.\nHistory\nDuring the mid-1980s, a permanent location for Australian Plant Society Grevillea Study Group's collection of grevilleas and other native plants was needed, which at the time were being kept in pots by founder and professional gardener, Ray Brown. He had designed the layout of the park five years prior to its creation, but did not have the land available to begin construction.\nRay made an approach to Wollongong City Council for a land lease, and in 1987, the Illawarra Grevillea Park was established.\nThe park was officially opened to the public on September 25, 1993.\nTo honour Ray's work and long contribution to the collection, horticulture and growing of grevilleas and the creation of the park, a newly described species of grevillea, Grevillea raybrownii was named after him by Peter Olde and Neil Marriott in 1994.\nOn August 12, 2022, the park gained official status as a botanical garden, with an opening being conducted by NSW governor Margaret Joan Beazley.\nDescription\nBanksia oblongifolia prostrate form\nSet on 2.4 hectares of land on the outskirts of Wollongong, the Illawarra Grevillea Park is a not-for-profit botanical garden featuring multiple display gardens primarily consisting of grevillea species, cultivars and hybrids, as well as a variety of other Australian native plants and a native rainforest.\nThe park was created with the aim of showcasing and encouraging the appreciation of Australia's plant biodiversity, providing information on native plant gardening and contributing to the study and conservation of rare and endangered plants. The park is continually maintained by volunteers throughout the year, but is only open to the public on open days on the first two Saturdays and Sundays of Autumn, Winter and Spring each year.\nGrevilleas\nThe park contains an extensive collection of 300-400 grevillea species, cultivars and hybrids. Many of the grevillea species were collected from the wild by Ray Brown and botanist, Peter Olde. Many of the grevilleas seen in the park are grafted. This allows a variety of new forms to be created, such as ground cover grevilleas being grafted onto Grevillea robusta to create a tall \"weeping\" form. Another reason grevilleas are grafted is to allow species from all across Australia, particularly those from Western Australia and the Northern Territory to grow within the park, as their roots would not survive otherwise.\nChapel\nThe park has a small chapel, built as an interdenominational church in a long-gone village named Sherbrooke, which was resumed by the NSW Government and flooded for the Cataract Dam Project in 1902. Before Sherbrooke was flooded, the church was relocated in parts to Woonona near Wollongong to be used as a private residence. It was relocated again to the Illawarra Grevillea Park in 1992 to prevent it from being bulldozed for new home units. Today, the chapel serves as a wedding venue, administration venue and bookstore during the park's open days.\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"About The Park\". Illawarra Grevillea Park. 2024.

    "Road in Kenya\nThe A7 road is a road in Kenya that spans 923 kilometers. It connects the Ugandan border to the port city of Mombasa, passing through Eldoret and Nairobi. The road is one of the main transportation routes in Kenya, providing an east\u2013west connection. It also serves as a route for international traffic to and from Uganda.\nRoute\nThe Highlands\nThe A8 highway begins at the Malaba border crossing with Uganda. From there, it extends eastward across the Kenyan highlands at an elevation over 1,100 meters above sea level. The road is paved and gradually increases in elevation to over 2,000 meters above sea level near Eldoret. The route passes through a rural area with a moderate population density and no large towns. There is a short section near Webuye where the A8 shares its route with the A1 highway.\nIn the vicinity of Eldoret, a highway-style bypass circumvents the town to the west and south, while the original route passes through the center. From Eldoret, the A8 proceeds in a southerly direction, gaining elevation to reach its highest point of approximately 2,800 meters above sea level, roughly midway between Eldoret and Nakuru. This section traverses a plateau, forming a transitional zone between the Rift Valley's vast expanse. Notably, the equator crosses the route at this point. Near Moli, a grade-separated interchange connects to the A12 highway. The A8 then enters Nakuru, a town situated at 1,800 meters above sea level, featuring a 2x2 lane passage and a viaduct with 2x3 lanes. As the route continues south, the terrain becomes more undulating, with moderate elevation changes. The A4 converges at Gilgil. North of Nairobi, the road ascends to higher ground, reaching an elevation of approximately 2,700 meters, followed by a steady descent towards Nairobi.\nNairobi Region\nFrom Limuru, the A8 highway features dual 2x2 lanes and begins its descent into the Nairobi metropolitan area, a vast urban expanse situated at approximately 1,700 meters above sea level. To facilitate through traffic, the Nairobi Southern Bypass offers an alternative route around the city, while the Nairobi Expressway, a toll road elevated on viaducts, provides a central passage. Notably, the A8 shares dual designation with the A2 within Nairobi. South of the city center, the A8 continues as a dual-lane road, providing access to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. In Athi River, the A2 diverges southward, while the A8 proceeds with a subsequent stretch featuring dual 2x2 lanes.\nSoutheastern Kenya\nBeyond the Nairobi region, the A8 traverses a more sparsely populated and arid area, characterized by a prolonged stretch of dry savannah en route to the coastal city of Mombasa. The road narrows to a single-lane paved thoroughfare, gradually descending to sea level. The terrain transitions to a flatter landscape, punctuated by occasional low-lying hills. The route alternates between lengthy straight sections and more winding passages. At Emali, the A5 branches off towards Himo, Tanzania, while at Voi, the A6 diverges towards the same destination. Approximately 100 kilometers west of Mombasa, the dry savannah gives way to a more humid, tropical lowland. The A8 eventually reaches Mombasa, a major port city, where it merges with city roads leading to the central business district. Alternatively, the Dongo Kundu Bypass Highway offers a branch route to the port of Mombasa. The A8 terminates in the old town of Mombasa, converging with the A7 highway.\nHistory\nColonial period\nDuring the British colonial era, significant investments were made in Kenya's infrastructure. In 1890, construction began on the Mackinnon-Sclater road, a dirt track suitable for oxcarts, connecting Mombasa to Busia on the Ugandan border. This early road followed the present-day A8 and A12 routes through western Kenya. However, its importance was soon eclipsed by the completion of the Uganda Railway in 1901, a rail line linking Mombasa to Kisumu on Lake Victoria. This railway created a vital connection between the Indian Ocean port city of Mombasa and Kisumu, later extended to Uganda, eliminating the need for lake crossings. The Kenyan highlands, a productive agricultural region with high population density and significant coffee and tea production, were already relatively developed during the colonial period. As a result, a network of paved roads was established in this area, setting it apart from other parts of East Africa.\nIndependent Kenya\nUpon gaining independence, Kenya inherited a relatively well-developed road network from British colonial rule, surpassing many other former colonies. The A8 route was the most advanced road in Kenya at the time, with the Busia border crossing initially serving as the primary entry point between Kenya and Uganda. However, the Malaba border crossing later gained prominence. During the 1980s and 1990s, the A8 remained Kenya's primary paved road. In Nairobi, the capital city, the road is remarkably well-developed by African standards,",
    "\nBridgeThe Gm\u00fcndertobelbr\u00fccke (literally \"Gm\u00fcndertobel Bridge\") in the Swiss canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden connects the Steinerstrasse (Route 463) between the towns of Stein and Teufen across the gorge of the Sitter river. It is located a few kilometers south of the city of St. Gallen, but is not part of the St. Gallen bridge trail because it is not located in the Canton of St. Gallen. The bridge is an important example of early concrete arch bridges and, when completed in 1908, was briefly the longest concrete arch bridge span in the world. It is classified by the Swiss government as a cultural property of national importance.\nStructure\nThe Gm\u00fcndertobelbr\u00fccke spans the Sitter with a large concrete arch 79 m wide, featuring two round arches on the east side and four on the west side, each with a span of 10.25 m. The bridge deck, elevated above the arch, is about 70 m above the bed of the Sitter. Originally, the bridge had a 5.70 m wide lane and two 0.60 m wide sidewalks, for a total width of 6.90 m between the concrete parapets. During a renovation in 1960 and 1961, the road deck was renewed and extended to a total width of 10.50 m.\nHistory\nA wooden crossing over the Sitter in the area of the present bridge was first mentioned in the 1530s. In 1710, a covered wooden bridge was built. After a flood in 1783, it was elevated; during this renovation, the roof trusses were raised so that riders no longer had to dismount. In 1856, it was replaced by the old Gm\u00fcndertobelbr\u00fccke, a truss bridge made of wrought iron on high cast iron pillars, which spanned the gorge at about 55 m above sea level. By 1900, the bridge had fallen into disrepair, and since there was enough gravel and sand in the Sitter valley, it was decided to build a concrete bridge that would span about 100 m downstream from the old iron bridge, at a point where it almost perfectly coincided with the surrounding elevation.\nThe new bridge was designed by Emil M\u00f6rsch, then a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, assisted by the cantonal engineer of Appenzell Ausserrhoden Andreas D. Sutter, who subsequently also assumed the construction management. Construction began in March 1907 and was completed on November 7, 1908, with the handover of the bridge to the canton. Construction costs were significantly higher than the bid price, partly due to the sharp rise in labor and material costs. This resulted in a loss of 25,000 francs for the construction company and its subsequent bankruptcy. The access roads were built with considerable delay, so the bridge was not opened to traffic until November 22, 1909.\nMajor renovations were carried out first in 1960 and 1961, along with the widening of the road deck, and then from 2011 to 2013, during which, among other things, the road deck was reinforced to meet current requirements.\nTechnical details\nDesign of the Gm\u00fcndertobelbr\u00fccke\nGm\u00fcndertobelbr\u00fccke under construction (1907/08)\nRenovation (2011)\nIn 1904, Emil M\u00f6rsch completed the Gr\u00fcnwalder bridge, with two three-hinged arches with spans of 70 m, at that time the largest concrete arches in the world. For the Gm\u00fcndertobelbr\u00fccke, he designed a fixed elastic arch without joints of 79 m, significantly larger. Although the design had to be based on the 1906 Swiss standard for reinforced concrete with its still very cautious estimates of permissible stresses, M\u00f6rsch calculated these estimates according to his theory or method of elasticity, which he presented in an article published in 1906. Today, the Gm\u00fcndertobelbr\u00fccke is considered an outstanding example of an integral concrete bridge, in which the structural components are connected to form monolithic structures characterized by integral load-bearing behavior, economic execution, and high aesthetics.\nThe arch has a rise of 26.5 m. Its width is 6.50 m at the apex and 7.50 m at the abutments. The thickness of the arch increases from 1.20 m at the apex to 2.13 m at the abutments. Theoretically, the arch did not need to be reinforced, but for safety reasons, an iron reinforcement was inserted into the upper and lower spandrels of the vault. The arch rests on deeply cemented abutments in the slopes about halfway up the gorge, which also form the foundations for the large piers on either side of the arch. There are 6 rows of four supports each on both halves of the arch, supporting the road deck, with the positions of the supports corresponding to the beams under the roadway. The inner supports have a square cross-section of 0.50 m \u00d7 0.50 m, while for architectural reasons, the outer piers have a T-shaped cross-section, giving them a wider viewing area of 0.80\u00a0cm. In addition, the outer supports follow the contour of the front surface of the large arch. All supports are firmly connected to both the arch and the road deck.\nThe road deck is divided into sections 49.3 m long on the openings on the western side, into sections 81.8 m above the main arch, and into sections 25.5 m above the two openings ",

Following this, he continued his studies and obtained a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1991, tutored by Eran Zaidel and Arnold Scheibel.\nCareer\nAboitiz's career started as a Research Fellow at the Beth Israel Hospital of Harvard Medical School, working in Norman Geschwind's and Albert Galaburda's laboratory, from 1983 to 1985, studying the neurological bases of language and developmental dyslexia. From 1985 to 1991, he pursued his Ph.D. at UCLA. Then, he held a postdoctoral position at Robin Fisher's laboratory at the Mental Retardation Research Center of UCLA, from 1991 to 1992. After this, he returned to Chile and served as a professor at the Medical School of Universidad de Chile (UCh) from 1992 until 2002, where he became director of the Morphology Department at the Institute for Biomedical Sciences of the Medical School at UCh. Since 2002, he has been appointed as a professor at the Psychiatry Department of the Medical School of the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile (PUC).\nBetween 2002 and 2006, Aboitiz participated as sub-director of the Millennium Center for Integrative Neuroscience, CENI, under the Millennium Scientific Initiative Program (ICM) promoted by the Chilean government. In 2009, he created and has been the current director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Neuroscience NeuroUC,\nIn 2010, Aboitiz developed the Neuroscience Ph.D. Program at PUC. In 2011, he was awarded as Director of the Center for the Neuroscience of Memory, CENEM, one of the seven new Millennium Scientific Nuclei. He holds the position of the Principal Investigator at the Laboratorio de Neurociencia Cognitiva y Evolutiva (LANCE), where he has directed more than 20 Ph.D. theses.\nResearch\nInitially in his career, Aboitiz focused on the comparative neuroanatomy of interhemispheric connections and brain asymmetries in humans and other mammals. He also investigated the cerebral cortex's origins in early mammals, proposing hypotheses that challenged established views that considered the mammalian cerebral cortex as a derivative of an ancestral reptilian-like brain. He suggested that the brains of reptiles and mammals underwent separate evolutionary histories, while also exploring the neuroanatomy of language networks, identifying their potential homologues in monkeys and suggesting a framework for human language circuits' evolution. In addition to this, his work in medical faculties has involved studying cognitive functions in various neuropsychiatric conditions, such as ADHD, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and schizophrenia, as well as language processing and social behavior in healthy individuals.\nIn one of his highly cited studies, Aboitiz contributed to a study of four brains of men with developmental dyslexia. The neuroanatomical findings showed that men with developmental dyslexia had developmental anomalies in the cerebral cortex, deviations from standard cerebral asymmetry, and associations with non-right handedness and autoimmune illnesses.  His Ph.D. thesis described the regional differentiation in fiber types within the human corpus callosum, finding patterns of density variation, no significant sex differences, and no correlation between overall fiber density and callosal area. Later, he proposed a hypothesis for the evolutionary development of the corpus callosum, highlighting how its fiber structure facilitates interhemispheric communication, particularly in sensory areas, and how brain size impacts this connectivity, potentially influencing brain lateralization.\nAboitiz has also led a research line concerning the cognitive mechanisms involved in the pathology of neuropsychiatric conditions, especially ADHD, and has used new neurotechnologies for sc",

    "1885 set of photographs\nSitting Bull and Buffalo Bill is a set of studio photographs of the Hunkpapa Lakota leader Sitting Bull and the entertainer Buffalo Bill, taken in Montreal in 1885. The session was held at the studio of William Notman during a North American tour of Buffalo Bill's Wild West, the Wild West show which enrolled Sitting Bull for a single season. The eight joint portraits of Sitting Bull and \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody were part of a commission for 47 photographs, which were printed and sold as cabinet cards during the tour.\nNine years prior to the session, Sitting Bull and Cody both famously participated in the Great Sioux War of 1876 on opposite sides. For this reason, the most widely distributed of Notman's dual portraits was frequently captioned \"Enemies in '76, Friends in '85\". It shows Cody pointing to an imagined horizon as he and Sitting Bull jointly hold a Winchester rifle. They are dressed in their archetypal show clothes and stand in front of a painted backdrop of a forest, as in the other dual portraits. Although interpretations of the pose vary, this image is considered emblematic of American history and culture.\nNotman's photographs helped establish the trope of the \"Cowboys and Indians\", a core element of the Western genre. They are also among the last taken of Sitting Bull before his killing by police in 1890. The depiction of his relationship with Cody in Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill has been analyzed and criticized by scholars in relation to the settler colonialism of the American territory.\nBackground\nGreat Sioux War of 1876\nIllustration of the \"first scalp for Custer\" found in promotional material for Buffalo Bill's Wild West\nOn 25 June 1876, as part of the Great Sioux War, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer commanded the 7th Cavalry Regiment against a coalition of Native American tribes, partly led by the Hunkpapa Lakota chief and medicine man Sitting Bull. The native coalition won the battle, killing Custer and everyone under his immediate command. The Battle of the Little Bighorn, as it became known, garnered considerable public interest but had little effect on the outcome of the war. The US army retaliated by sending more soldiers to the region, and the native coalition was fragmented. In the spring of 1877, Sitting Bull and his group exiled themselves in Canada.\nDuring the Great Sioux War, the showman, soldier and hunter William F. Cody, better known as Buffalo Bill, was chief of scouts of the 5th Cavalry Regiment. Although he did not participate in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, he was a past acquaintance of Custer. A month after the battle, during a skirmish at Warbonnet Creek, he killed and scalped a Cheyenne warrior, Yellow Hair, and allegedly proclaimed the event as \"the first scalp for Custer\", in honour of the commander. Cody's dramatization of the incident furthered his career as a showman, eventually becoming part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West, the show which he created in 1883.\nBuffalo Bill's Wild West\nProgram cover for the 1885 season\nIn 1881, after a four-year exile in Canada which was marked by insufficient food and resources, Sitting Bull returned to the border and surrendered to United States officials. He was a federal prisoner of war at Fort Randall until his release in 1883, after which he was made to live at the Standing Rock Agency as a ward of the American government. In 1885, Cody expressed interest in recruiting him to the Wild West. The show, made up of dramatized reenactments of recent episodes in American frontier history, enrolled Native Americans as performers. Although Sitting Bull was open to the idea, which would allow him to leave the reservation, Secretary of the Interior Lucius Q. C. Lamar was initially firmly opposed. After relentless pressure from Cody and his manager, John Burke, Lamar eventually relented and agreed for Sitting Bull to appear in the show's parade and in the arena, although not as a performer in the reenactments.\nOn 6 June, Sitting Bull signed a four-month contract with the Wild West, which paid him $50 (equivalent to $1,696 in 2023) per week with a bonus of $125 (equivalent to $4,239 in 2023). He also insisted on a clause giving him the exclusive right to sell souvenir photographs of himself and to charge a sitting fee to those who would wish to pose with him. On 12 June 1885, he joined the show in  Buffalo, New York, one of 40 American and Canadian cities in the itinerary. He quickly became one of its central attractions, contributing to the financial success of the 1885 season. His performance consisted in riding into the arena, alone on his mustang, and being taunted as the murderer of George Armstrong Custer. While he was generally booed in the United States, he was cheered on in Canada, where the show toured in the summer. In Montreal, where the Wild West arrived on 10 August and settled for a week (in the neighbourhood of Pointe-Saint-Charles), Sitting Bull was treated as an important visitor; he was presented t",
    "Municipal District of Brno in South Moravian Region, Czech Republic\nBrno-Medl\u00e1nky is a self-governing district of Brno, Czech Republic, on the northern edge of the city. It consists of the district and cadastral area of Medl\u00e1nky (German: Medlan), originally an independent municipality that was annexed to Brno in 1919. Its cadastral area is 3.51 km\u00b2. The self-governing district was established on November 24, 1990. About 6,100 inhabitants live here.\nThe Medl\u00e1nky Airfield is located in the cadastre of the district, mainly with gliders. Medl\u00e1nky is also home to the V p\u00fast\u00fdch vineyard track. For the purposes of the senate elections, Brno-Medl\u00e1nky is included in electoral district number 60 of the Brno-City District.\nEtymology\nThe name of the settlement is a diminutive of the original designation of its inhabitants, Medlan\u00e9 (the oldest document from 1237 has the wording Medlan), which meant \"people from medla\", meaning slowly flowing water (the name is the opposite in meaning to the name of the nearby Bystrc). A diminutive form is documented from the end of the 16th century in the form of Mydl\u00e1nky, and from the 17th century also Medl\u00e1nko.\nHistory\nAlthough the majority of the modern cadastral area of Medl\u00e1nky originally belonged to the cadastral territory of the former village of Medl\u00e1nky, the peripheral parts of the modern cadastre belonged to the cadastral areas of Kom\u00edn and Kr\u00e1lovo Pole until the second half of the 1960s, on the contrary, some parts of the original cadastral area of Medl\u00e1nky have belonged to the cadastral area of Medl\u00e1nky since the end of the 1960s to the modern cadastral areas of Kr\u00e1lovo Pole and \u0158e\u010dkovice.\nBeginnings of settlement\nOpen to the south, the Medl\u00e1nky cadastre with an abundance of loess soils forms part of the long-established area of southern Moravia, as evidenced by archaeological findings. This is evidenced by the frequency of finds in the Medl\u00e1nky brickyard, especially the settlement pit discovered in 1905 with decorated, preserved bell-shaped cups of the culture of the same name (2000 BC) and the burial ground found in 1935\u20131937 with the graves of typical \"squatters\" of the Bronze Age - Unetic culture (1900 \u20131700 BC).\nDuring a survey in 1954 and subsequent planned rescue research in 1964 and 1984 at the construction sites of Meopta and the Research Institute of Energy, the Archaeological Institute of Czechoslovakia also uncovered dozens of foundations of stilt houses and pit settlement buildings with grain cellars from the period of the bin field culture (Velatic culture, 1250\u20131000 BC, and Podolian culture, 1000\u2013700 BC) and from the early Iron Age (Hor\u00e1k culture, 700\u2013400 BC). Archaeologists place one uncovered settlement pit - a granary with ancient pottery - in the 8th century, and almost 70 others - of which 8 are residential stilt pits, with stone ovens in the corner - in the 9th century, i.e. the period of creation and expansion of Great Moravia.\nThe history of the following centuries, which have not yet been documented by settlements or grave finds, gives a right to conclude that at that time the community settled here developed into a settlement or village of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty - the property of the monarch, as historical sources bluntly inform us.\nMiddle Ages\nThe first preserved written document proving the existence of the village at this time is the charter of King Wenceslaus I from August 14, 1237, by which Medl\u00e1nky, destroyed by his own war campaign and still belonging to the school of St. Peter in Brno, exchanges for his undamaged property in Bosonohy.\nAfter 1237, historical sources are silent about Medl\u00e1nky for more than 100 years. Only in the years 1344\u20131380 are Brno townsmen mentioned as owners. In the years 1381\u20131489, Medl\u00e1nky was owned by the lords of Medlansk\u00fd from Medlan,then from 1489 to 1559 by the Pern\u0161tejn family. For this 70-year-long ownership, the year 1532 is significant for Medl\u00e1nky, when the then owner Jan IV of Pern\u0161tejn (he was then the regional governor of the Margraviate of Moravia) freed the subjects of Medl\u00e1nky from slavery \u2013 this privilege lasted for about 100 years and was abolished during the post-Battle of White Mountain era. From 1559 to 1588, Medl\u00e1nky was owned by Petr Sadovsk\u00fd from Sloupno, who bought it from the Pern\u0161tejn family together with the Sokolnice manor. In 1588, Hendrych Pfefferkorn from Ottopach became the new owner of Medl\u00e1nky for 22 thousand gold. However, he did not enjoy his wealth for long, as he died soon after. In 1590, the indebted descendants sold Medl\u00e1nky to Jind\u0159ich the Younger, Burgrave from Dohna. Even here, however, ownership did not last long, and in 1596 Medl\u00e1nky became the property of Bohuslav Bo\u0159ita from Bude\u010d.\nIn the post-White Mountain period, in 1622, Bohuslav Bo\u0159ita from Bude\u010d sold Medl\u00e1nky to Al\u017eb\u011bta Pergarka from Perg, n\u00e9e Kummerov\u00e1, who owned Medl\u00e1nky until 1650. During these years, Medl\u00e1nky was held for a short time by Ferdinand Zikmund Sak from Bohu\u0148ovice, who, however, he got into debt and so",

    "\nAbdillahi Askar (Somali: Cabdillaahi Askar Barkhad;1947 \u2013 29 August 2010) is a Colonel of Somali National Movement (SNM). \nBiography\nAdAwDiGaHaclass=notpageimage| Relation map.Ad=Addis Ababa, Aw=Aware, Di=Dire Dawa, Ga=Gashamo, Ha=Hargeisa\nAbdillahi Askar was born in 1947 in Dire Dawa, Ethiopia. He enlisted in the Somali Armed Forces and trained as an officer in the Soviet Union.\nEstablishment of SNM\nIn 1981, the Somali National Movement (SNM) was founded in London, England, with the goal of opposing the Somali dictatorship.\nShortly after the establishment of the SNM, SNM military bases were created in Gashamo and Aware, and Askar became commander of one of the bases in the Aware area. The deputy commander was Dayib Gurey.\nOperation Birjeex\nCommemorative photo after the rescue. Abdillahi Askar is in the center of the front row.\nIn December 1982, the SNM sent Abdisalan Turki and Abdillahi Askar from Gashamo in eastern Ethiopia to Hargeisa. In April 1983, Abdillahi Askar arrived in Hargeisa.\n On April 8 he was arrested in an old movie theater.\nEleven people belonging to the SNM were to rescue Abdillahi Askar. This was later dubbed Operation Birjeex. The SNM team led by Ibrahim Ismail Koodbur rescued him with two casualties.\nSNM's counterattack\nIn November 1984, the SNM invaded the former British Somaliland by dividing its forces into three units: western, central, and eastern, with Askar leading the western unit. The western contingent lost 347 of its 383 men killed; the SNM as a whole lost the war this time.\nOn May 31, 1988, the SNM again invaded Somaliland, and Abdillahi  occupied Hargeisa as one of the SNM's Colonels.\nDeath and After\nOn August 29, 2010, He died in Hargeisa. The funeral of the deceased was attended by the President of Somaliland and hundreds of Somalilanders.\nLater, the Abdillahi Askar Military Academy, named after him, was established in Dararweyne (east of Hargaysa) and graduated its first class in 2020.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Mujaahid C/llaahi Askar Oo Si Heer Qaran Ah Loogu Aasay Hargeysa Iyo Taariikhda Qisada Dhacdadii Mucjisada Ahayd Ee Hawlgalkii Birjeex\" .

    "Former bank in Czechoslovakia\nHead office building in Prague\nExterior sculpture\nEntrance lobby\nBanking hall\nBranch in Bratislava, designed by Du\u0161an Jurkovi\u010d:\u200a104\u200a\nThe Bank of the Czechoslovak Legions (Czech: Banka \u010deskoslovensk\u00fdch legi\u00ed), generally referred to as Legiobanka, was a cooperative bank in interwar Czechoslovakia. It was founded in Irkutsk in 1919 to serve the financial needs of the Czechoslovak Legion and prospered in subsequent years thanks to its strong patriotic associations. Under Nazi occupation during World War II, it was renamed Czecho-Moravian Bank in Prague (Czech: \u010ceskomoravsk\u00e1 banka v Praze) between 1940 and 1945. It was eventually nationalized and absorbed by \u017divnostensk\u00e1 Banka in 1948.\nIts head office building in Prague, designed by Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r, is so representative of the particular Czechoslovak version of art deco architecture known as rondocubism that the latter is sometimes referred to as Legiobanka style (sometimes \"Legiobank style\").:\u200a178\u200a\nOverview\nThe creation of the bank, in Irkutsk in the autumn of 1919, was preceded by that of the Military Savings Bank (Czech: Vojensk\u00e1 spo\u0159itelna a year before. A key figure for the establishment of both institutions was Franti\u0161ek \u0160\u00edp\u00a0, a legionnaire officer responsible for the logistics and financing of the approximately forty thousand-strong legionary army in Russia. \u0160\u00edp logically became the bank's first general manager. The bank maintained its activity throughout the interwar period. In addition to its head office, it had four local branch offices in Prague and 17 local branches in the rest of the country, in Berehovo, Bratislava, Brno, Duchcov, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Jihlava, Kol\u00edn, Louny, Lovosice, Ostrava, Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom, Olomouc, Pie\u0161\u0165any, Plze\u0148, Poprad, Turnov, and Zvolen.:\u200a102\u2013103\u200a\nDuring the presidency of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk in the 1920s and 1930s, the bank was associated with the political group around him known as the Hrad (lit.\u2009'the castle'). In the late 1930s, its building was also the seat of the Party of National Unity. \nIn 1940, the occupation authorities ordered the bank to rename itself as Czecho-Moravian Bank in Prague. In 1943, it was designated for merger with Kreditanstalt der Deutschen, a cooperative bank of the German community in Prague that had been established in 1911, but that plan was not carried out. The Legiobanka was re-established under its former name in July 1945, shortly after liberation,:\u200a101\u200a and nationalized in October 1945 under Decree No. 102/45. In 1948, the Communist authorities forcibly merged it into \u017divnostensk\u00e1 Banka, which itself was absorbed in 1950 into the State Bank of Czechoslovakia.\nHead office\nThe bank was initially located in Prague's \u0160tef\u00e1nik barracks and then in the hotel U Sask\u00e9ho dvora\u00a0. In 1923, it moved into its own new head office building\u00a0 designed by architect Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r in 1921. It displays four figurative representations by sculptor Jan \u0160tursa of the Legion's fighting, respectively on the Italian front (battles of Doss'Alto\u00a0 and the Piave), Eastern Front (Zborov), Russian Far East (the revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion on the Trans-Siberian Railway, known in Czech as the Magistr\u00e1le), and Western Front (Vouziers and the Terron\u00a0). Above these is a frieze depicting the return of the Legions, by Otto Gutfreund.:\u200a103\u200a Visual artist Franti\u0161ek Kysela\u00a0 led the interior design.\nIn 1922, Legiobanka purchased the adjacent building at Na Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed 26, and in 1937\u20131938 had it rebuilt on a design by Franti\u0161ek Marek to host various facilities including the avant-garde D 34 Theatre\u00a0 led by Emil Franti\u0161ek Burian. The theatre was revived from 1960 to 1991 as the E. F. Burian Theatre\u00a0. \nThe building was purchased in 1990 by \u010cSOB, which had it renovated in 1991\u20131994 and keeps a branch at the street level. In 1994, the theatre was revived again as Archa Theatre\u00a0, after which the entire building is also known as the Archa Palace (Czech: Pal\u00e1c Archa).\nSee also\nNational Bank of Czechoslovakia\nReferences\n^ a b c Alain Soubigou (2007), \"La legiobanka, un outil contre la brutalisation de la m\u00e9moire de guerre Tch\u00e9coslovaque\", Guerres mondiales et conflits contemporains (228): 91\u2013105\n^ Vendula Hn\u00eddkov\u00e1 (2013), N\u00e1rodn\u00ed styl.

    "Entrepreneur and former Indian modelDino Martelli, previously known as Deepak Malhotra (born 1964), is a former Indian model and actor, who now runs an apparel company.\nEarly life\nDeepak lived in Bangalore, where he studied in Christ University from 1982 to 1985.\nHe was a member of Bangalore Club, and was also a national-level gymnast.\nCareer\nModelling\nOne of the earliest finds of Design and Print Group, Malhotra began his career modelling for a menswear line in Bangalore, and soon became one of the most sought after models during the late 1980s and the early 1990s.\nHe was the face of Vimal, a major textile brand of Reliance Industries, for many years; and reportedly had a contract of \u20b91.5 Lakhs in 1987, which was unprecedented at that time. He gained further popularity with his TV advertisement for Aramusk, a soap that was promoted as being for the \"extravagantly male\".\nActing\nDeepak Malhotra and Sridevi in the poster of Lamhe (1991)\nAfter his success as a model, he started getting movie offers, and moved to Mumbai. In 1991, he made his film debut with Yash Chopra's Lamhe, starring alongside Sridevi and Anil Kapoor. He was first cast in Chamatkar (1992), but gave it up to act in Lamhe, and the role went to Shah Rukh Khan. However, Lamhe didn't do very well, and his acting was panned.\nYash Chopra was planning to make Darr (1993) with Deepak Malhotra and Raveena Tandon, with Saahil Chadha as the antagonist. But because of the performance of Lamhe, Chopra decided to cast more established actors; hence ultimately Sunny Deol and Shah Rukh Khan were cast in the roles Malhotra and Chadha were supposed to play, respectively. Raveena also opted out of the project, and her role went to Juhi Chawla.\nBefore Malhotra's first acting gig in Lamhe, Gautam Rajadhyaksha had suggested his name to Rahul Rawail for the lead role in Rawail's next movie. Rawail made Bekhudi (1992) after that, but the role eventually went to another debutant Kamal Sadanah.\nIn 1992, Malhotra was signed by N. Chandra for Tejasvini (1994), which was the Hindi remake of the Telugu film Karthavyam (1990), and had Vijayashanti reprising her role as the protagonist. However, in 1993 before the movie was even released, Malhotra decided to quit acting and leave India and move to the United States where he had been offered modelling contracts.\nEntrepreneurship\nMalhotra moved to New York City and changed his name to Dino Martelli. There he studied industrial engineering and designing, and started working in the field of apparels. He is currently the principal at NYC Made Apparel, which he co-founded in 2018.\nIn 2003, he opened Caf\u00e9 Sesso in The Courtyard in Colaba, Mumbai with his friend and business partner Sabina Chopra, co-founder of Yatra.com. It shut down over a year later, and they took up the management of the restaurant at Breach Candy's Moksh gym and leisure club, naming it Spring.\nPersonal life\nIn 1998, Dino married model-turned-fashion choreographer Lubna Adam, who had opened India's first fashion model training school Catwalk in Bombay in 1990. They were in a relationship for 11 years before their marriage, and after getting married moved to New York where they lived in Upper West Side.\nThey have two sons\u2013 Kian Martelli, who was a decorated athlete in Riverhead High School, and is a designated partner in Lubna Adams Luxury Lifestyle Llp; and Kyle Martelli, salutatorian of Riverhead High's graduating Class of 2021, who is currently a student at Boston University Questrom School of Business. The Martelli brothers have also modelled for Manish Malhotra's fashion collection.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Dino Martelli Email & Phone Number | NYC Made Apparel - ContactOut\". contactout.com.

    "Danish syndicalist organisation\nThe Trade Union Opposition Federation (Danish: Fagoppositionens Sammenslutning; FS) was a Danish trade union federation. Established in 1910 by syndicalist opponents of the social-democratic dominance over trade unions, the FS pursued a strategy of dual unionism and worked within existing trade unions with the intention of radicalising them. The membership of the FS consisted largely of industrial workers in Copenhagen, where they carried out a series of strike actions, including wildcat strikes, to improve working conditions. \nThe FS experienced a surge in growth during World War I, as the social-democratic unions failed to keep up with the rising cost of living, while the syndicalists secured reductions in working hours and wage increases. By the end of the war, the FS had reached its peak with 3,000 members; its members participated in the storming of the Stock Exchange, secured the eight-hour working day and the weekend, and contributed to the reduction of unemployment. But around the time of the Easter Crisis of 1920, the syndicalist movement experienced a series of defeats and splits that led to its decline. Divides between the anarcho-syndicalists and communists resulted in the FS splitting, with the former establishing their own small federation, while the latter merged into the Communist Party of Denmark (DPK). \nEstablishment\nThe growth of syndicalism in Denmark was slower than in Norway and Sweden, as Danish trade union leaders had been able to establish collective bargaining rights much earlier than in the other Scandinavian countries. But following a wave of lockouts, when the social-democratic leadership of Danish trade unions agreed to a compromise deal with business owners, disillusionment among the rank-and-file began to increase. By the end of the 1900s, revolutionary syndicalist ideas had begun to gain traction within the Danish labour movement.\nIn December 1908, the country's first syndicalist organisation, the Danish Syndicalist Federation (Danish: Syndikalistisk Forbund; SF), was established. Christian Christensen, the editor of the SF's magazine, soon became the leader of the Danish syndicalist movement. In 1910, he established the Trade Union Opposition Federation (Danish: Fagoppositionens Sammenslutning; FS), which became the country's main syndicalist organisation during the 1910s. In December 1911, the FS began publishing its weekly journal Solidaritet (Solidarity), which was edited by Christensen. The ideological platform of the FS was closely influenced by the industrial unionism of the British syndicalist Tom Mann, who was invited to speak before the FS in Denmark.\nEarly activities\nAlthough they had relatively few active members, the syndicalists were effective at securing wage increases and cultivating social unrest within the labour movement. The Danish syndicalists pursued a strategy of dual unionism, organising within existing unions in order to influence their direction towards syndicalist practices. During its early years, the FS had only 30-40 members, largely drawn from Copenhagen's soil and concrete industries. When 1,200 soil and concrete workers went on strike in the winter of 1911, their social-democratic union leaders resigned, leaving the inexperienced syndicalists in charge of directing the strike. The social-democrats attempted to delegitimise the strike by alleging that the workers had been manipulated by the syndicalists, a claim which Christensen rejected.\nIn the spring of 1911, in response to a series of lockouts in Copenhagen, members of the FS called sympathy strikes in support of the affected workers. Over the subsequent years, the FS made notable progress in increasing its trade union presence, gaining the adhesion of blacksmiths, mechanics, dockworkers and construction workers in the Danish capital. But the advancement of collective bargaining procedures by the social democrat-led unions, both among skilled and unskilled workers, caused difficulties for the growth of the FS. Attempts to gain a foothold in the provincial towns were also largely unsuccessful, with the FS mainly gaining members in Copenhagen.\nThe social democrats came to see syndicalists as the main threat to their political party's leadership over the trade unions. Social democrats infiltrated syndicalist meetings to disrupt their proceedings and report on their activities to the party leadership, with one interrupting a speech by Christensen on syndicalism in France to defend the social-democratic unions in Denmark and Germany. In 1912, Carl Madsen, the general secretary of the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions, published a critique of the syndicalists' program of direct action, industrial unionism and decentralisation, claiming it would cause the \"breaking up of the economic community\".\nThe FS was closely connected to the Central Organisation of Swedish Workers (SAC), a relatively powerful syndicalist union with 32,000 members in several industries.

    "Palace in Grosseto, Italy\nThe Palazzo delle Poste (transl.\u2009Post Office Building) is an administrative building which serves as the Poste Italiane headquarters in Grosseto, Tuscany. It was designed by architect Angiolo Mazzoni and completed in 1932. The building features an exterior in a monumental style, typical of the Fascist architecture, while the interior is characterized by a closer alignment with the modern principles of Italian rationalism. It also houses sculptures by Napoleone Martinuzzi and Domenico Ponzi.\nLocation\nThe building is situated in the suburb of Porta Nuova, outside the city walls, and is bordered by Via Roma and Viale Giacomo Matteotti, overlooking Piazza Fratelli Rosselli, formerly Piazza Umberto I, and commonly known as Piazza della Vasca. It serves as a key visual landmark aligned with Via Fallaci, leading into the historic center. The square features significant architecture from different periods and styles: the neo-classical Palazzo del Governo; Ludovico Quaroni's modern multi-purpose building from the 1970s; the Villino Panichi with its Renaissance Revival and Art Nouveau-style elements; and the austere former Royal Normal School (now \"Giovanni Pascoli\" middle school).\nHistory\nAs part of Benito Mussolini's plan to tackle unemployment, Decree No. 10102 on 8 July 1930, authorized the construction of the Post and Telegraph Building in Grosseto, designed by architect Angiolo Mazzoni. Mazzoni selected a site in a circular square named after Umberto I, outside the city walls in the suburb of Porta Nuova. After initial design revisions, the final project was completed by June 1930. Expropriations began in April, and demolition of existing buildings, including the recently built Art Nouveau-style Palazzo Barth, started in September.\nThe masonry contract was awarded to Milan's Rusconi Carlo company in September 1930, with a significant discount on the estimated cost. The work, which began on 4 February 1931, and involved around 120 workers daily, was completed by 20 October 1932. Marble, travertine, and granite were supplied by Societ\u00e0 Marmifera Nord Carrara of Montecatini group. The building was inaugurated on 13 November 1932, in the presence of King Victor Emmanuel III. Additional completion works were approved in August 1939.\nPost-war modifications included raising the central body of the building in 1953 (completed in 1955), constructing a new single-story section for mail carriers in 1963, and expanding the public hall and director's apartment in 1975. A request was made in 1983 to raise the eastern wing on Via Roma.\nDescription\nThe building's rear on Via Roma\nExterior\nThe clock tower\nThe main portal with the Tamed Maremma group by Napoleone Martinuzzi\nThe building is a city landmark with a monumental and rhetorical style. It has a trapezoidal plan due to the plot's shape, leading to an unconventional layout along the bisector of the angle formed by the adjacent streets. The main section, facing Piazza Rosselli, is clad in Rapolano travertine and features entrance arches. This section is connected to two nearly symmetrical wings along Via Roma and Viale Matteotti, with central spaces linking them and overlooking a rear service courtyard.\nThe main facade, about 20 meters high, is divided into three parts, highlighted by a monumental portal with a lintel supported by Ionic columns and topped by the marble group of Maremma Domata (\"Tamed Maremma\") by Napoleone Martinuzzi. A prominent elliptical tower, containing the main staircase, serves as a visual and functional hinge between the wings. The tower's verticality is accentuated by a central window illuminating the staircase and directing attention to small clock openings below the windowed loggia at the top.\nThe facade's slight concavity follows the square's circular shape, balanced by a convex granite staircase leading to a paved plaza in Rapolano travertine. This plaza features a circular fountain with a Portasanta marble basin and a central diorite sphere. Smaller portals, framed by Portasanta marble fasces, lead to elegant rooms with high-quality materials, including yellow marble from Mori and green Alpi marble benches.\nOriginal glass and brass lights are found by the entrances to the public hall, which has wooden paneling with integrated neon lighting. The right-side room, missing a marble bench, features a bronze statue of Saint Christopher by Martinuzzi.\nThe long facades on Via Roma and Viale Matteotti, rising over three floors plus a mezzanine, have regular window sequences: larger and arched on the ground floor, square on the mezzanine, and rectangular above. These facades are brick-clad with travertine accents, including floor bands, frames, and corner elements. Above the entrance arches to the small rooms, two large tripartite windows with thermal lunettes illuminate the public hall. The facade on Via Roma includes a service entrance arch and a small cross-shaped space paved with blue ceramic tiles. The eastern end feature",
    "Painting by Thomas Lawrence\nPortrait of Sir Edward Pellew is a portrait painting by the English artist Thomas Lawrence of the British naval officer Sir Edward Pellew, produced around 1797. \nPellew joined the Royal Navy as a boy in 1770 and served during numerous campaigns during the American War of Independence and French Revolutionary War. At the time Lawrence painted him Pellew had become known for his command of frigate HMS Indefatigable and it may commemorate a 1797 action fought against the much larger  French ship Droits de L'Homme which was driven ashore and wrecked on the coast of Brittany. Pellew won popular acclaim for the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816, a campaign to end the slavery practiced in North Africa.\nLawrence was an established young portrait painter and later became President of the Royal Academy. Pellew is shown wearing the full dress uniform of a Captain. Lawrence's portrait was the basis for an 1815 mezzotint print by Charles Turner, now in the National Portrait Gallery. The gallery also has a later 1804 portrait of Pellew by James Northcote.\nPortrait of Pellew by James Northcote, 1804.\nLawrence's portrait belonged to Edward Hawke Locker who acted as civil secretary for Pellew and was possibly given it as a gift by Pellew. It is now part of the collection of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.\nReferences\n^ Davey p.viii\n^ Art for the Nation: The Oil Paintings Collections of the National Maritime Museum.

The game's graphics were particularly praised, with many noting the impressive detail in the arenas and the diverse, albeit fictional, roster of wrestlers. The visual presentation was considered a high point, showcasing what the Commodore 64 could achieve.\nHowever, the game was not without its criticisms. Players described the in-ring action as simplistic and repetitive, which detracted from the overall experience. A common point of contention was the minimal involvement of Sgt. Slaughter in the game, which many fans found disappointing. This perceived underutilization of the popular wrestling figure led to some considering the game to be a missed opportunity.\nSee also\nList of professional wrestling video games\nReferences\n^ Djeljosevic, Danny (April 13, 2024). \"10 Bizarre Wrestling Video Games Gamers Forgot About\".

    "Tattooing among Albanians is a long-standing tradition that has been practiced since Illyrian times, kept alive in the mountainous areas of the western Balkans.\nHistory\nBased on the writings of ancient authors such as Herodotus (5th century BC), Cicero and Strabo (1st century BC), whose statements are also confirmed by archaeological findings, ethnographic studies have concluded that the practice of tattooing among the peoples of the Balkan peninsula was known since classical antiquity. This practice was found among the Illyrian and Thracian tribes, who used tattooing to distinguish tribal origins.\nEarly figurative representation of the Palaeo-Balkan custom of tattooing on 610-550 BC Daunian funerary stele from Apulia.\nLong bronze needles with wooden handles found in Glasinac and Donja Dolina  are considered to have been tools for practicing tattoos. Early figurative representations of this ancient Balkan tradition are found in Apulia, southeast Italy, in the material culture of the Daunians, who were of western Balkan provenance. The custom of tattooing among Daunians can be detected in Daunian stelae and in matt-painted ollae. It can also be conceivably identified on the wall of a late 4th-century tomb chamber from Arpi, in which a painting shows tattoos on the arms of the 'priestess' riding a quadriga. Daunian material culture shows that among them forearms were the most common tattooed parts of the body.\nIn the Graeco-Roman world tattooing was conceived as a barbaric custom that was used exclusively for punitive or ownership purposes, but the ancient Balkan peoples' perception of tattooing was different, as it was a deep and long-standing cultural embodiment distinguishing them from other cultures. The writings of ancient authors show that in the Balkans tattooing was in the purview of the elites. Iconographic and literary sources reveal in particular that it was especially practiced by the female members of society.\nThe tattooing practice is most often found in preliterate tribal communities, with women playing the chief role in this custom, both performing the ritual of applying tattoos and wear them. Among other things the tattoos may have been a symbol of sexual maturity, ancestry and tribal affiliations, as well as religious beliefs. In the western Balkans, isolated from outside influences, the practice of tattooing continued until the early 20th century in Albania and Bosnia, regions that in antiquity were part of the area of Illyria.\nEdith Durham's research\nIn the first half of the 20th century, British anthropologist Edith Durham visited northern Albania and other areas of the western Balkans, in particular collecting and studying cultural and folklore material of the Albanian tribal society.\nDurham found that in Bosnia tattooing was a practice restricted to the Catholic Slavic population, while the Orthodox Slavic population abhorred this practice, considering it \"Latin\". On the other hand, Durham found that in northern Albania it was widespread among Albanians regardless of their Catholic or Muslim faith.\nDurham reported that girls were tattooed on March 19, which falls in the days of the Albanian spring celebrations.\nGeographic distribution\nEdith Durham provided information about tattooing in northern Albania, but 20th century ethnographic research found that traditional tattooing was widespread throughout Albanian inhabited territories.\nSee also\nSicanje\nReferences\n^ Lelaj 2015, p.\u00a094; Tirta 2004, pp.\u00a068\u201370; Durham 2004, p.\u00a094; Norman 2018, pp.\u00a063.\n^ Lelaj 2015, p.\u00a094.\n^ Norman 2018, p.\u00a062.\n^ Norman 2018, p.\u00a061.\n^ a b Norman 2018, pp.\u00a061\u201362.\n^ a b Norman 2018, pp.\u00a063.\n^ Elsie 2010, p.\u00a0120.\n^ Lelaj 2015, p.\u00a094; Norman 2018, pp.\u00a063.\n^ Tirta 2004, p.\u00a0254.\n^ Lelaj 2015, pp.\u00a098\u2013100.\nBibliography\nDurham, Edith (2004).

    "Spanish-Argentine publisher\nFrancisco de Paula Oller Sim\u00f3n (1860\u20131940) was a Spanish and Argentinean publisher. Politically he supported the Carlist cause. He is known mostly as owner, manager and the moving spirit behind numerous Traditionalist periodicals, mostly El Legitimista Espa\u00f1ol (1898\u20131912) and Espa\u00f1a (1915\u20131929), both published in Buenos Aires. In Spain he briefly issued some Carlist Barcelona-based periodicals in 1889\u20131892; during this period he managed a publishing house Biblioteca Tradicionalista and published numerous propagandistic books, booklets and brochures. In 1898-1912 he was the chief Carlist representative for South America.\nFamily and youth\nfather\nThe Oller surname, possibly of French origin, was first noted in Spain in Catalan records from the 11th century; however, there is close to nothing known about Oller's distant ancestors. His paternal grandparents were Manuel Oller from Barcelona and Rosa Pallarol from San Vicente dels Horts, yet their social position remains unclear; according to their grandson, they formed a \u201cmodest family\u201d. Their son and the father of Francisco, Manuel Oller Pallarol (1810\u20131888), reportedly followed somewhat chaotic secondary education curriculum and ascended to middle strata, though it is not certain what he was doing for a living. In parish books he was recorded as \u201cpropietario\u201d and apparently he had enough financial means to engage in legitimist and Catholic propaganda and charity; fearing his economic contribution to the Carlist war effort, during the Third Carlist War the government embargoed his property. At unspecified date Manuel married Concepci\u00f3n Sim\u00f3n Ramonich (1824\u20131883), also from Barcelona.\nIt is not clear how many children Manuel and Concepci\u00f3n had and whether Francisco had any siblings. The family was fervently religious and he was brought up accordingly. He inherited also the Carlist zeal; following outbreak of the Third Carlist War he twice escaped from home trying to enlist in legitimist troops, but failed. The third attempt was successful, and in 1874, as a 14-year-old, he was able to \u201cchange my college cap for a Carlist beret\u201d. Francisco's war lasted barely a year; serving in 4. Batall\u00f3n de L\u00e9rida under Ceferino Escola, he took part in defense of Seo de Urgel and was taken prisoner there, according to his own account in the rank of alf\u00e9rez. Back in Barcelona he returned to school and some time in the late 1870s he obtained bachillerato in the local Escuelas P\u00edas. In 1880 he was due to perform military service, evaded by means of regular substitution payment of 2.000 pesetas.\nLo Crit de la Patria\nIn 1881 in Havana Oller married Carmen Anguis Carmona (1868-?). None of the sources consulted provides any closer information, e.g. it is not known whether the bride was Cuban, in what circumstances the two have met and why Oller travelled across the Atlantic. In 1883 latest the couple resided in Barcelona. Oller entered the editorial board of a freshly launched Catalan-language Carlist weekly, Lo Crit de la Patria; it was owned by Antonio Quintana, a local publisher and owner of the La Propaganda Catalana publishing house. According to some earlier historiographic works Oller founded or co-founded the weekly and himself he claimed having managed it since the early 1880s, but a present-day historian maintains he assumed management somewhat later. Francisco and Carmen lived in Barcelona. It is not clear how many children they had, but there is only one known, Concepci\u00f3n Oller Anguis, born in the late 1880s. She would later marry in Buenos Aires; Oller had one granddaughter, Concepci\u00f3n Amoedo Oller, an Argentinean citizen.\nSpain (1883-1892)\n Oller, late 1880s\nExcept an unsuccessful 1886 attempt to run for Diputaci\u00f3n Provincial of Barcelona, Oller focused on propaganda. Apart from a theatrical drama Combates del coraz\u00f3n (1884) he wrote La Espa\u00f1a Carlista (1885), a set of essays revolving around the Third Carlist War and largely formatted as polemics with Antonio Pirala. He also wrote few prologues and one translation from French. In 1887 he assumed management of Lo Crit de la Patria and steered it as a vehement Carlist propaganda vehicle, publishing venomous diatribes against the Madrid governments. However, in 1888 he faced a conflict within Traditionalist ranks, caused by secession of Nocedal-led faction named Integrists. Quintana assumed ambiguous stand, and Oller suspended his collaboration having declared that \u201cl\u2019estat de la lluyta actual dins lo partit carlista\u201d makes him re-consider. Eventually, when Lo Crit de la Patria sided with the rebels, Oller opted for total loyalty to his king and left the periodical.\nThough no longer behind the steering wheel of Lo Crit, in 1888 Oller was subject to legal investigation related to articles, published earlier during his tenure. Apart from open exaltation of Carlos de Borb\u00f3n as the king, he was also charged with barely veiled reference to the prime minister Sagasta as \u201ccanalla\u201d. The matter was examin",
    "American college football season\nThe 1961 Albright Lions football team was an American football team that represented Albright College of Reading, Pennsylvania, as a member of the Middle Atlantic Conference (MAC) during the 1961 college football season. In their seventh year under head coach John Potsklan, the Lions compiled a 7\u20130\u20131 record (4\u20130\u20131 in MAC games), finished second in the MAC Northern College Division, and outscored opponents by a total of 264 to 68.\nCoaches of the MAC Northern College Division selected quarterback Gary Chapman as the most valuable player in the division. Chapman and three other Albright players received first-team honors on the 1961 MAC Southern College Division all-star team. The other three honorees were end Gary Sheeler; tackle George Reagan; and guard George Sighman.\nChapman and Sheeler were also selected by the Associated Press as first-team players on the 1961 All-Pennsylvania football team. Reagan was named to the second team.\nThe Lions played their home games at Albright Stadium in Reading, Pennsylvania.\nSchedule\n\nStatistics\nThe team tallied 2,814 yards of total offense (351.75 yards per game), consisting of 1,708 rushing yards (213.5 yards per game) and 1,106 passing yards (138.25 yards per game). On defense, Albright held opponents to 1,186 yards of total offense (148.25 yards per game) with 648 rushing yards (81 yards per game) and 538 passing yards (67.25 yards per game).\nThe team's individual statistical leaders included halfback Tom Olivo with 561 rushing yards, quarterback Gary Chapman with 974 passing yards and 1,074 yards of total offense, end Steve Simon with 19 receptions for 360 yards, and halfback Doug Deicke with 57 points scored (7 touchdowns and 15 extra point kicks). Olivo broke Albright's all-time scoring record, surpassing the mark set by Dick Riffle from 1935 to 1937.\nReferences\n^ \"S.U. Stars Get All-Star Berths\". Sunbury Daily Item.

    "Extinct genus of starfishes\nAlkaidia is an extinct genus of sea stars which lived in the western Tethys Ocean from the Barremian to Cenomanian stages of the Cretaceous period. It was first described in 1998, and two species are currently assigned to it. The type species, A. sumralli, is known from both complete and fragmentary specimens collected in Texas, and fossils of an earlier species, A. megaungula, have been found in Morocco.\nDiscovery and naming\nThe fossilized remains of Alkaidia were first described by paleontologists Daniel B. Blake and Robert Reid, III in a 1998 publication describing some Albian-aged starfish fossils from north-central Texas. The authors determined that over 50 specimens (some complete and other fragmentary) originating from the Washita Group represented a new genus and species which they named Alkaidia sumralli. The generic name references Alkaid, a star in the constellation Ursa Major, while the specific name honors Colin Sumrall, who discovered and prepared some of the specimens, including the holotype. A complete specimen (1786TXI) found in deposits of the Del Rio Formation at Waco Dam Quarry was designated as the holotype, and was placed in the Texas Memorial Museum. Some additional fragments from the same locality and from the Paw Paw Formation were designated as paratypes.\nA second species of Alkaidia was described in 2020 by paleontologists Timothy A. M. Ewin and Andrew S. Gale based on material originating from the Taba Starfish Bed of the Barremian-aged Taboulouart Formation in Morocco and purchased from commercial fossil collectors. This species was named Alkaidia megaungula, the specific name meaning \"large hoof\" in Greek and referencing the large terminal ossicle of this species, which resembles a hoof. The studied specimens are well-preserved and represent numerous individuals of various growth stages, allowing an ontogenetic series to be shown.\nReferences\n^ Blake, Daniel B.; Reid, Robert (1998). \"Some Albian (Cretaceous) asteroids (Echinodermata) from Texas and their paleobiological implications\".

    "\nJoseph-Charles d'Almeida (November 11, 1822 \u2013 November 9, 1880) was a French experimental physicist who founded the Journal de physique in 1872 and the French Physical Society in 1873.\nBiography\nD'Almeida was the son of Portuguese rentier Francisco de Almeida Portugal, later Count of Lavradio, under the Franconized name of Louise Jos\u00e9phine Pierrette Miller who served as an advisor to the Portuguese embassy in Paris. He was a friend of Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand and Jean-Guillaume Hyde de Neuville.  \nD'Almeida studied first at a private school, the Pension de Reusse and then at the Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis and then at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV. He wanted to join the Ecole Polytechnique but estrangement from his family led to changes in his plans. He became a preparator for the professor Pierre-Henry Blanchet from 1843 and in 1848 he became an associate professor of physics at the Lyc\u00e9e Corneille. D'Almeida became a naturalized French citizen in 1844. His license to teach physics ran into bureaucratic troubles due to his citizenship and a period of political turmoil. The Lyc\u00e9e d\u2019Alger was established in Algeria and d'Almeida was recruited for it. In 1851 he was able to get help from Marcellin Berthelot who was a close friend and peer from college. Berthelot helped him find a position at the laboratory of Antoine-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Balard's in Paris. He received a doctorate for work on electrolysis. He gave lessons from 1853 to Nestor Gr\u00e9hant in his apartment on rue Royer-Collard.  He became an adjunct professor at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV which was now known as the Lyc\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on. Along with Augustin Boutan, he authored a physics textbook for secondary schools which was first published in 1862.\nD' Almeida met Jules Janssen (1824-1907) in 1855 and became interested in spectra. He also took an interest in anaglyphs using magic lanterns projecting in two colours and viewing them through two coloured filters in 1858. In 1860 he worked on electrolysis of alcohol and nitric acid along with Pierre-Paul Deh\u00e9rain. He visited Portugal and then the United States in 1862. He met William Douglas O'Connor, Rebecca Harding Davis, James Thomas Fields, Henry Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Louis Agassiz. In 1869 he went with Antoine-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Balard, Marcellin Berthelot, Jules Jamin, \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey to the inauguration of the Suez Canal. In 1870 he took part in a balloon flight and he tried along with Jean-Gustave Bourbouze to use the Seine river as an electrical conduction with a view to allow telegraphic messages to be sent from Poissy to Desains. In 1872 he founded, along with Charles Brisse, Berthelot and Desains, the Journal de Physique. The next year, he was among the founders of the French Physical Society and served as its general secretary.\nHe died of a heart attack and was buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. This was later moved to the P\u00e8re-Lachaise ossuary. A bust by Eug\u00e8ne Guillaume was placed in the meeting room of the Physical Society in 1881.\nPublications\nD\u00e9composition par la pile des sels dissous dans l'eau, Martinet, 1856 \u2014 Th\u00e8se de doctorat.\n(with Augustin Boutan) Probl\u00e8mes de physique, Dunod, 1862 \u2014 online quatri\u00e8me \u00e9dition (1874).\n(with Paul-Jean Coulier et Marcellin Berthelot), V\u00e9rification de l'ar\u00e9om\u00e8tre de Baum\u00e9, Gauthier-Villars, 1873.\n\u00ab\u00a0Nouvel appareil st\u00e9r\u00e9oscopique\u00a0\u00bb, Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, 1858, t.\u00a0XLVII, p.\u00a061\u201363\nCours \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de physique suivi de probl\u00e8mes, Dunod, 1874\n(with Augustin Boutan) Cours \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de physique, pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 de notions de m\u00e9canique et suivi de probl\u00e8mes, Dunod, 1863, 1867, 1884\n(with Augustin Boutan) Probl\u00e8mes de physique, Dunod, 1862\nTh\u00e8se de physique, sur la d\u00e9composition par la pile des sels dissous dans l'eau, Martinet, 1856\nRapport sur une mission confi\u00e9e \u00e0 Charles d'Almeida par le Gouvernement de la D\u00e9fense nationale dont l'objet \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00e9tablir des communications entre la Province et Paris lors de la Guerre de 1870-1871, Tours, Deslis Fr\u00e8res et Cie, 1913 .\nJournal de physique th\u00e9orique et appliqu\u00e9e.

    "\nChemical compound\n3-phenoxymandelonitrile (also 3-phenoxy-\u03b1-cyanobenzyl alcohol) is an organic compound belonging to the group of cyanohydrins. It is primarily used in the synthesis of pyrethroids, a class of insecticides.\nProduction\nThe synthesis of 3-phenoxymandelonitrile begins with the reaction of 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde with sodium cyanide and acetic anhydride in a water/dichloromethane mixture, using benzyltriethylammonium chloride as a phase transfer catalyst. This reaction initially produces the acetate, which can be hydrolyzed enzymatically with a suitable lipase to yield enantiomerically pure (S)-3-phenoxymandelonitrile through chiral resolution. The desired product can be extracted at this stage. The remaining enantiomeric acetate can undergo racemization via reaction with triethylamine in toluene or diisopropyl ether to improve yield. An alternative synthesis involves transferring a cyano group from acetone cyanohydrin to 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde. Again, enzymatic reactions through an ester can be used to produce the enantiomerically pure compound.\nUse\n(S)-3-Phenoxymandelonitrile serves as an important intermediate in the production of various pyrethroids, which are carboxylic acid esters incorporating the compound as an alcohol component, and are employed as insecticides. Notable examples within this group include deltamethrin and esfenvalerate. The presence of the 3-phenoxy group and nitriles enhances the efficacy of these compounds compared to other pyrethroids.\nDeltamethrin, an ester of 3-phenoxymandelonitrile used as an insecticide\nReferences\n^ \"(S)-2-Hydroxy-2-(3-phenoxyphenyl)acetonitrile\". pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.\n^ a b c Ayelet Fishman, Michael Zviely (January 1998), \"Chemo-enzymatic synthesis of (S)-\u03b1-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol\", Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, vol.\u00a09, no.\u00a01, pp.\u00a0107\u2013118, doi:10.1016/S0957-4166(97)00608-3\n^ a b Yongjin Chen, Jianping Wu, Gang Xu, Lirong Yang (October 2006), \"Separation of \u03b1-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol from \u03b1-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl acetate using solvent extraction\", Separation and Purification Technology, vol.\u00a051, no.\u00a03, pp.\u00a0424\u2013429, doi:10.1016/j.seppur.2006.03.006{{citation}}:  CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link)\n^ Tingzhou Zhang, Lirong Yang, Ziqiang Zhu, Jianping Wu (October 2002), \"The kinetic study on lipase-catalyzed transesterification of \u03b1-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol in organic media\", Journal of Molecular Catalysis B: Enzymatic, vol.\u00a018, no.\u00a04\u20136, pp.\u00a0315\u2013323, doi:10.1016/S1381-1177(02)00112-1{{citation}}:  CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link)\n^ Takamitsu Kobayashi, Keiichiro Nishimura, Toshio Fujita (November 1989), \"Effects of the \u03b1-cyano group in the benzyl alcohol moiety on insecticidal and neurophysiological activities of pyrethroid esters\", Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology, vol.\u00a035, no.\u00a03, pp.\u00a0231\u2013243, Bibcode:1989PBioP..35..231K, doi:10.1016/0048-3575(89)90084-9{{citation}}:  CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link)\n",

    "Road in Singapore\nTanjong Rhu Road is a minor arterial road in Tanjong Rhu, Singapore. A combination of the words Tanjong (meaning cape) and pokok rhu (casurina littoria), the earliest mention of the road is thought to be in Emanuel Godiho de Er\u00e9dia's 1604 map of Singapore where it was referred to as Tanjon Ru. In 1828, as a part of the Jackson Plan, Tanjong Rhu was made as a shipyard. However, there were squatters and water pollution in the shipyards, culminating in the government getting rid of them to build luxurious condominiums. \nHistory\nTanjong Rhu Road is named after the Malay words Tanjong (English for cape) and rhu (based on pokok rhu, where rhu refers to the casuarina littoria species of casuarina tree). Whilst it is unknown when the road was named Tanjong Rhu Road, it is known that the earliest source in which name appears is Emanuel Godiho de Er\u00e9dia's 1604 map of Singapore, titled, Discripsao chorographica dos Estreitos de Sincapura e Sabbam, ano 1604, which refers to the area as Tanion Ru. Colonial maps of Singapore in the first half of the 19th-century referred to the area as Sandy Point, which was gradually replaced by Tanjong Rhu. The \"Rhu\" in Tanjong Rhu likely referred to the abundance of casuarina trees in the area.\nVessels undergoing repairs at the shipyard in Singapore in January 1932\nIn 1828, as a part of the Jackson Plan, Sir Stamford Raffles intended for Tanjong Rhu to be a shipyard. Prior to the publication of the map, William Flint (who was a \" of the shipbuilding business\") decided to start a shipbuilding company in Tanjong Rhu in 1822. George Lyons and his brother also set up a shipyard in the 1850s. By the early 20th century, Tanjong Rhu became a venerable shipbuilding hub with many known companies having shipyards there such as Thornycroft and United Engineers as well as having clients such as the Singaporean Marine Police Force and the Ceylon Navy. As a matter of fact, bugis traders from celebes used to anchor their mosquito boats in the Kallang Basin by Tanjong Rhu for trade from the 19th century to the early 1960's before docking to the Telok Ayer Basin. In February 1977, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew ordered for the Kallang Basin (including the Tanjong Rhu shipyard) to be cleaned up since it was polluted. This resulted in only five shipyards remaining as they complied with the government's prerequisite of upgrading their facilities as well as complying with pollution regulations by 29 June 1985. Additionally, the coffin-makers, firewood and charcoal dealers, godowns, rubber and sawmills, and squatters in Kampong Arang (near Tanjong Rhu Shipyard) were phased out by 1982, with them receiving compensation following recent appeals to the Singapore Land Authority. By January 1987, the charcoal and firewood dealers moved Lorong Halus at the mouth of the Serangoon River whilst the rest (except for the squatters) were moved to factories with proper apparatus for their respective skill trade.\nDetails\nTanjong Rhu Road is a minor arterial road starting from Rhu Cross (a local access road) and ending at a junction with Meyer Road and Fort Road. It is estimated to be 2.56km long due to the road having a loop and a one-way access road, both with the name 'Tanjong Rhu Road'. It runs parallel with  the East Coast Parkway (ECP) whilst a section of the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) runs underneath Tanjong Rhu Road.\nLandmarks\nCamelot-by-the-Bay\nCasuarina Cove\nDunman High School\nPebble Bay\nExit 1 of Tanjong Rhu MRT Station\nThe following is a list of landmarks that are on or are in close proximity to Tanjong Rhu Road:\nCamelot\nCasuarina Cove\nDunman High School\nFort Road\nFortredale, a 19-storey condominium which stood at the junction of Tanjong Rhu Road and Fort Road. Architect and academic Robert Powell wrote in 2000 that the \"eye-catching\" tower block \"stands apart for its strongly individualistic expression.\" He further wrote that it \"exudes confidence and defiance of convention\" and \"struts its stuff along Tanjong Rhu Road while its neighbours look, in comparison, aesthetically geriatric.\"\nKatong Park MRT station (Exit 2)\nMeyer Road\nPebble Bay\nSingapore Swimming Club\nPebble Bay\nTanjong Rhu Bridge\nTanjong Rhu MRT station (Exit 1)\nReferences\n^ a b Thulaja, Naidu Ratnala (24 January 2018). \"Tanjong Rhu Road\".

    "Lake in the Philippines\nKayangan Lake is a brackish lake on Coron Island in the Philippines. Maintained by the local Tagbanwa people, the lake is one of the most popular tourist attractions on the island and has been regarded as the cleanest lake in Asia.\nHistory\nThe lake is named after the local name for the red-vented cockatoo, \"kayangag\", and is one of thirteen lakes that are sacred to the local Tagbanwa. They believe that nature spirits lived in the lakes and that it was disrespectful to swim or fish in the waters. After more tourists began to visit the islands, the elders opened up two lakes, Kayangan Lake and Barracuda Lake for tourism in 2001. To make sure the lake was still sacred, they performed a ritual called uliwansag to get permission from the nature spirits to allow outsiders in the lake. The tribe received ancestral domain for the lake and much of the island from the government in 2002, after a long and difficult process. Accessible by boat and requiring an entrance fee, the lake is maintained by the native Tagbanwa people and became one of the most popular tourist attractions on the island. It has been regarded as the cleanest lake in Asia.\nFeatures\nMany tourists and visitors to the lake partake in swimming and snorkeling, though this is only permissible in certain parts of the lake. Life vests have been mandatory since two Czech tourists drowned in 2017 after freediving. Scuba diving is also restricted due to the lake's strong underwater currents. The water is additionally very clear, with the rock formations and fish under the water being visible from the surface. Guides rent bamboo rafts to tour people around the lake. The lake is surrounded by many limestone karsts and connected to Awuyuk Cave, a nearly pitch black cavern. The lake comprises 70% freshwater and 30% saltwater, and few animals are found in the lake due to the brackish water, but crabs and snails are common. One of the most common fish that can be found is the freshwater garfish.\nReferences\n^ Martinez, Manoling (January 5, 2023). \"Kayangan Lake - What You Need to Know, How to Get There, & FAQs\".

    "2024 single by Hanumankind\nNot to be confused with Big Dawg.\n\"Big Dawgs\" is a song recorded by Indian rapper Hanumankind featuring producer Kalmi. It was released on July 9, 2024, under the label Universal Music India. The music video, in which Hanumankind performs within a classic carnival attraction known as the well of death, (\"Marana Kinar\" in the Malayalam language) was released on the same day.\n\"Big Dawgs\" quickly gained international acclaim, debuting at number 57 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song has amassed 65 million streams on Spotify and went viral on TikTok with 111 million views, and over 1,600,000 searches on Shazam. The song's success led to Hanumankind being featured on the cover of Spotify's Global Hip Hop Playlist and signing with Capitol Records.\nBackground\n\"As a producer I don\u2019t actually listen to a lot of hip-hop. I think that allows me to think outside the box and innovate more than I would be able to otherwise. If I'd known 'the rules' I might\u2019ve done something less impactful\".\n\u2014Producer, Kalmi talking about the song.\nHanumankind's breakthrough came with the 2023 track \"Go To Sleep\", featuring music by Parimal Shais and a nod to Fight Club. The song was praised for Hanumankind's daring style. In 2024, he released a song called \"Big Dawgs\", produced by Kalmi under Brown Crew Productions, and released under the label Universal Music India, which has been recognized as his biggest hit so far.\n\"Big Dawgs\" is a powerful anthem that embodies resilience and ambition. The song blends traditional Indian (naadan) swagger with Western musical influences. It features a dynamic combination of punk energy and intense drum beats, creating a powerful and hard-hitting sound. The lyrics reflect Hanumakind's personal journey and resonate with the aspirations of his generation. The song emphasizes themes of hard work and determination, showcasing Hanumankind's lyrical skill through clever wordplay and metaphors. Some have accused the song of supposedly ripping off the flow of American rapper Project Pat from Drake's song \"Knife Talk\", although Hanumankind makes a direct reference to Project Pat in the lyrics.\nMusic video\nDevelopment\nThe music video for \"Big Dawgs\", directed by Bijoy Shetty, was shot in Ponnani, Kerala at the Great Indian Maruty Circus in the \"Well of Death\", traditionally known as \"Marana Kinar\" in Malayalam language in Kerala. This rapidly vanishing carnival act showcases motorcyclists and drivers performing gravity-defying stunts within a cylindrical structure. Hanumankind's choice to film his video in this setting pays tribute to a dying art form, revitalizing a spectacle that has captivated regional audiences for decades.\n\"A lot of things are happening in this video. But mainly, if you want something, take that risk, man, or else it won't happen. Even if you fail, it's still the act of doing. For me, even if this video didn't work out, I get to tell my grandchildren that I actually sat inside the well of death and did this. At the very least, if nothing worked out, I'm happy about that\".\n\u2014Rapper, Hanumankind talking about the music video.\nAccording to creative director Bijoy Shetty, Sooraj initially proposed using cars and bikes in the video. Shetty was against this idea, believing it would blend in with other content and lack originality. This resistance led to a moment of inspiration: While Shetty was in a rickshaw; he heard a bike engine that resonated with the song's sample. Afterward, Shetty researched and conceptualized the video. Shetty remarked, \"It was an idea that everybody had in their mind but never executed. It was an idea waiting to be done\".\nSynopsis\nIn the video, the opening screen displays a typical \"Warning\" message indicating that the stunts were performed by professionals and advising viewers not to attempt them. However, Hanumankind interrupts this warning by saying, \"Hey, shut the fuck up\", effectively dismissing the message. The video cuts to Hanumankind standing at the edge of the cylindrical structure, surrounded by a group of stunt performers. As the song begins, the performers ride their motorcycles and drive a car around the well at high speeds. The performance scenes are interspersed with shots of the audience, who are mesmerized by the show.\nReception\nStreamer Shaquille Davis praised the song and its production, identifying Hanumankind's Texas rap influences. He also noted a striking resemblance between Hanumankind's outfit in the \"Big Dawgs\" music video and Freddie Mercury's style. Samaah Noor Sheikh, writing for The Print, criticized the American streamer IShowSpeed for repeatedly asking \"Why does he sound good?\" in his reaction\u2014 \"as if it was hard for him to believe that an Indian rapper could actually be good\". Despite this, Sheikh acknowledged that IShowSpeed's reaction helped platform the Indian music scene.\nCommercial performance\n\"Big Dawgs\" has reached number 23 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on the most recent chart, marking a significant achi",
    "H\u00ebna (Albanian indefinite form H\u00ebn\u00eb; Gheg: Hana, indef. Han\u00eb), the Moon, holds a prominent position in Albanian pagan customs, beliefs, rituals, myths, and legends. In Albanian traditions the Moon's cyclical phases have regulated many aspects of life, defining agricultural and livestock activities, various crafts, and human body.\nAlbanians were firstly described in written sources as worshippers of the Sun and the Moon by German humanist Sebastian Franck in 1534, but the Sun and the Moon have been preserved as sacred elements of Albanian tradition since antiquity. The symbolization of the crescent Moon, often combined with the Sun, is commonly found in a variety of contexts of Albanian folk art, including traditional tattooing, grave art, jewellery and house carvings.\nIn Albanian pagan beliefs and mythology the Moon is a personified female deity, and the Sun (Dielli) is her male counterpart. In some folk tales, myths and legends the Moon and the Sun are regarded as wife and husband, also notably appearing as the parents of E Bija e H\u00ebn\u00ebs dhe e Diellit (\"the Daughter of the Moon and the Sun\"); in others the Sun and the Moon are regarded as brother and sister, but in this case they are never considered consorts. In Old Albanian the name Hana/Han\u00eb was attested also as a theonym \u2013 the Albanian rendering of Roman goddess Diana.\nAlbanian beliefs, myths and legends are organized around the dualistic struggle between good and evil, light and darkness, which cyclically produces the cosmic renewal. The most famous representation of it is the constant battle between drangue and kulshedra, which is seen as a mythological extension of the cult of the Sun and the Moon. In Albanian traditions, kulshedra is also fought by the Daughter of the Moon and the Sun, who uses her light power against pride and evil, or by other heroic characters marked in their bodies by the symbols of celestial objects, including in particular the Moon. Among Albanians the dualism between black/darkness and white/light is also remarkably represented by the Moon's phases, which symbolize both fertility (increase) and sterility (decrease).\nName\nThe Albanian word h\u00ebn\u00eb (definite form: h\u00ebna; Gheg: han\u00eb, def. hana) is generally considered to be from the Late Indo-European *skond-nah\u2082 \"the shiny one\".\nAs an Albanian theonym, Hana/Han\u00eb is recorded as early as 1685, in the Cuneus Prophetarum (\"The Band of the Prophets\") by the Old Albanian writer Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani, as the Albanian rendering of Roman goddess Diana.\nHistory\nHuman's imagination has always been stimulated by the light of the Moon that pushes away the darkness of the night, as well as by the Moon's occult influence on the movement of the waters and on the life of plants and animals, giving rise to countless and suggestive myths, symbols, and legends across different cultures. Since ancient times the personified Moon has expressed maternity, and the celestial body has carried all these motifs in astrological symbolism.\nPrehistoric Illyrian symbols used on funeral monuments of the pre-Roman period have been used also in Roman times and continued into late antiquity in the broad Illyrian territory. The same motifs were kept with identical cultural-religious symbolism on various monuments of the early medieval culture of the Albanians. They appear also on later funerary monuments, including the medieval tombstones (ste\u0107ci) in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the burial monuments used until recently in northern Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, southern Serbia and northern North Macedonia. Such motifs are particularly related to the ancient cults of the Sun and Moon, survived until recently among northern Albanians.\nThe widespread deification of the Moon among Albanians is considered to have been related to the ancient worship of a local deity associated with agriculture and nature. Hana/Han\u00eb as a theonym is recorded by Bogdani as the Albanian rendering of Roman Diana. Of the Albanian mythological figures, Zana \u2013 usually associated with mountains, springs and streams, forests, vegetation and animals, human vital energy and sometimes destiny \u2013 is thought to have been originally a pre-Roman deity, and an Illyrian goddess equivalent of the Ancient Greek Artemis and Roman Diana. As such she would have been the personification of the Moon and the lady of the forests, protector of animals, guardian of springs and streams, protector of women, as well as distributor of sovereignty. Many statues and other items associated to this goddess have been found in the Shkodra region in northern Albania, maybe more than of any other goddess of the Illyrian pantheon. There is also an exceptional frequency of ancient inscriptions of the Roman era dedicated to the cult of Diana in Albania and the rest of the Balkans, which gives reason to think of an interpretatio romana of an indigenous pre-Roman goddess. Innumerable Albanian folk poems, myths and legends that are dedicated to Zana and her friends have been handed down to modern tim",
    "1853 train derailment in West Virginia\nThe Wheeling rail disaster refers to a train derailment that occurred near Wheeling, West Virginia in March of 1853.\nBackground\nIn January of 1853, Wheeling, West Virginia was officially connected by rail by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which was the first time that the ports of the Atlantic Ocean were connected by rail to the Ohio River valley. The Appalachian Mountain range proved to be difficult in term of forming a railway connection, however, when completed, rail travel across the mountainous area began immediately.\nThe completed railway included a rail bridge that crossed over the Cheat River; the bridge had a curved 116-foot grade, but the construction of the bridge included crossties being held in place by loosened nails.\nAccident\nOn March 27th, 1853, around 3 o'clock, P.M., a two-engine train carrying four cars (three of which were full of passengers) departed from Wheeling was crossing the bridge over the Cheat River. As the train passed over the already-loose crossties, the nails holding the beams in place detached. The train derailed as a result and sent the cars down the hundred-foot embankment.\nAs the passenger carriages tumbled down the embankment, furnaces in the passenger cars broke loose and spilled burning-hot coals onto the floor. The passenger coaches, which were made of wood at the time, proved to be weaker and would shatter and splinter in severe accidents; this combined with the spilled coals started a fire, further trapping passengers already caught in the disaster.\nThe initial death toll is stated as 8, but is believed to be as high as 17. This was the first time in the history of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad that passengers perished as the result of an accident.\nSee also\nAngola Horror - A train derailment that occurred in a similar manner in 1867.\nReferences\n^ Sibray, David (January 2018). \"B&O Railroad completed to Wheeling on Jan. 1, 1853\".

    "Historic noodle restaurant in Busan, South Korea\nNaeho Naengmyeon (Korean:\u00a0\ub0b4\ud638\ub0c9\uba74; Hanja:\u00a0\u5167\u6e56\u51b7\u9eb5) is a historic restaurant in Uam-dong\u00a0, Nam District, Busan, South Korea. It is named for and serves the cold noodle dish naengmyeon, but is reportedly most famous for its claim as being the first restaurant to serve milmyeon in South Korea. The restaurant is among the oldest active restaurants in South Korea, having been founded in 1919, during the Japanese colonial period.\nThe restaurant was first founded in a small coastal village in what is now North Korea. In 1950, after the outbreak of the Korean War, the owning family fled to Busan as refugees. They reopened the business there in 1953. It has remained in the same location since then.\nHistory\nThe restaurant was originally founded in 1919 as Dongchun Myeonok (\ub3d9\ucd98\uba74\uc625) by female restaurateur Lee Yeong-sun (\uc774\uc601\uc21c). It was originally located in Naeho-ri (\ub0b4\ud638\ub9ac), Hungnam-bu, Kanky\u014dnan-d\u014d, Korea, Empire of Japan (now Hamhung, North Korea). Jung Han-geum was the second-generation owner of the restaurant. The restaurant continued to operate there, through the colonial period and the 1945 division of Korea. In December 1950, after the outbreak of the Korean War, the family fled to Busan, South Korea as part of the Hungnam evacuation. The family sold snacks in order to prepare to reopen their restaurant. After raising enough money, they purchased a noodle machine. In March 1953, they reestablished the restaurant in Busan, this time with the new name Naeho Naengmyeon. The restaurant is named after their hometown, which they were reportedly homesick for and expected to soon return to.\nThe restaurant was at first operated as one of the many temporary refugee shacks in the city. The shack reportedly had no chairs and used wooden boxes for tables. It had space for five to ten guests at a time. They adapted the noodle recipe to their circumstances. Instead of the traditional potato starch, they used wheat flour, which was rationed out by the United States Army. In addition, they made the dish more spicy and salty, to appeal to the tastes of people from Gyeongsang Province. Their dish reportedly soon attracted national attention. It began to be sold in other restaurants in the city, and became seen as a local specialty of Busan. By 2024, there were around 500 milmyeon restaurants in the city. The restaurant grew to several times its original size, by purchasing adjacent properties. In 1975, third generation owner Lee Chun-bok took over the business.\nBy 2023, Yoo Jae-woo was the fourth generation of the family to be running the restaurant. It was reported that the noodles used around 70% wheat flower and 30% sweet potato starch around that time.\nInvention of milmyeon\nWhether the restaurant is the first to serve milmyeon has been disputed. There are a number of theories for how the dish came about. One theory is that the dish organically developed among the North Korean refugee population due to their shared circumstances in Busan at the time. Another theory is that the dish originated in the nearby city of Jinju and spread to Busan, although one reporter expressed doubt on this theory.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f \ubc15, \uc885\ud638. \"\ub0b4\ud638 \ub0c9\uba74(\u5167\u6e56\u51b7\u9eb5) - \ubd80\uc0b0\uc5ed\uc0ac\ubb38\ud654\ub300\uc804\".

He was also a Neo-Confucian scholar of the Satsunan school, and author of a number of books. He is especially noted as the author of an account of the history of firearms entitled Tepp\u014d-ki. and for T\u014d Ry\u016bky\u016b shi narabi ni jo (\"Verses and Preface on the Chastisement of Ryukyu\u201d) describing the history of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom and the justifications for the 1609 Shimazu invasion of Ryukyu.\nBiography\nNanp\u014d Bunshi was born in  Nang\u014d Sotoura, Obi, Hy\u016bga Province. His pseudonym \"Nang\u014d\" comes from this place of birth. A child prodigy, he showed extraordinary talent from an early age and was called Manju-d\u014d after the Buddhist bodhisattva of wisdom Manjushri. At the age of 12, he was tonsured and entered the Nichiren sect temple of Enmei-ji (now Saimy\u014d-ji) in Nichinan, under the given name Gensh\u014d. He studied Zen and Japanese Neo-Confucianism under Ichi\u014d Genshin of Ry\u016bgen-ji, a disciple of Keian Genju, and Song dynasty studies of the Four Books and Five Classics and the Book of Changes under Jiangxia Yuxian of the Ming dynasty. He excelled in the exegesis of chapters and verses. In 1569, at the age of 15 he went to Kyoto and became the successor of Kishun Ry\u016bki of Ry\u016bgin-an sub-temple of Tofuku-ji. In 1583 he returned to Kyushu and became head priest of Jing\u014d-ji in Osumi Province and then Sh\u014dj\u016b-in in Hy\u016bga Province. He also studied Neo-Confucianism under Koka Yuken, a Chinese scholar who had become a retainer of the Shimazu clan.\nIn 1599 he was invited to accompany Shimazu Yoshihiro to Kyoto. In 1602, he was invited by the Shimazu clan to be the founder of the temple of Dairy\u016b-ji, which was sponsored by Shimazu Iehisa. The following year, in 1603, he was appointed to serve as an envoy to Tokugawa Ieyasu at Sunpu, and at Ieyasu's recommendation, he held a purification ceremony at Kench\u014d-ji, and was summoned by Emperor Gomizunoo to give a lecture on new commentaries on the Four Books at the Imperial Court. He was known for his deep scholarship. He was in charge of the diplomatic correspondence of Satsuma Domain with Ming China and the Ryukyu Kingdom. He inherited the school of Neo-Confucianism known as the \"Satsuma school\", which was started by Keian Genju, and revised the annotations that Genju had added to the Annotated Four Books. He is also credited with coining the name Jigen-ry\u016b to a style of Japanese swordsmanship practiced by Satsuma Domain samurai.\nGrave of Nanp\u014d Bunshi\nNanp\u014d Bunshi's grave is located in the cemetery of the temple of Ankoku-ji in Aira, Kagoshima.

Joaquim, Almeida's father was a railway worker with origins in the neighborhood of Dongri in Mandur, Goa. Joaquim was known for his collaborations with the Konkani comedian Jacinto Vaz in tiatrs, a distinctive style of Goan theater. Furthermore, he was noted for his participation in raising toasts and performing \"toast songs\" (saude), a genre of Goan drinking songs. Almeida's mother, Clara, was known for her singing abilities. She was commonly requested to lend her vocal talents to wedding festivities in Goa, specifically during the traditional roce ceremony.\nAlmeida began performing publicly at a very early age. During her early childhood at around the age of 9, when she was in the 4th grade, she often entertained audiences with her singing talent at school assemblies and community events in her village, receiving invitations to perform from the young boys in the area. During this period, Agnelo D'Costa, a well-known singer originating from her town of Navelim, was also actively performing in the region. One day, Almeida encountered D'Costa riding a bicycle and, having heard him sing on the radio before, she approached him and asked him to share one of his songs with her. Rather than simply giving her a song to perform, D'Costa extended an offer for her to join him in his upcoming musical production that was to feature professional Goan theater artists. In this collaboration, Almeida was tasked with providing vocal accompaniment to D'Costa as the lead singer. Through this opportunity, she went on to participate in three of D'Costa's musical shows.\nCareer\nAlmeida's professional acting career began in 1988 at the age of 15, when she was invited to perform in the tiatr (Goan Konkani theater) production Gulam (Servant), directed by Peter de Benaulim. Following her debut, Almeida went on to act in various khells (street plays) produced by Menino De Bandar. This exposure led to further opportunities, and she subsequently performed in tiatrs (or theater productions) directed by a number of popular figures in the local theater scene, including Lino Dourado, Jack Ferry, Roseferns, C. D'Silva, her future husband Filipe Almeida, Joe Rose, Mario Menezes, Prince Jacob, Pascoal Rodrigues, Patrick Dourado, Meena Leitao, Premanand Sangodkar, Elvis-Carmin, and Wilmix-Sharon. Lino's work involved her participation in a minimum of three theatrical productions known as khell tiatrs. As Almeida's career progressed, she became a regular performer, often collaborating with her husband Filipe as well as other popular directors in the Goan theatrical tradition.\nAlmeida has been involved in various theatrical and cinematic productions in the region. In July 2015, she was cast in the tiatr (Goan theater) production titled Maink Paik Azilant Dovorat (Keep Parents At Eldercare). In this performance, she played the role of a wife opposite the Comedian Ambe. Additionally, she participated as a vocalist in a sextet ensemble that included Aurelio, Ambe, Franky Gonsalves, David, and Samenca. Two years later, in June 2017, Almeida was featured in the Konkani film Chori (Theft), directed by Jacinto Cruz. For this DVD-format movie, she was cast alongside her husband Filipe, with the two portraying comedic characters. A review published in the local newspaper O Heraldo observed that Almeida, Filipe, Comedian Selvy, Comedian Richard, and Comedian Agostinho combine to form a well-balanced quintet that excels in providing humor and entertainment. However, the reviewer proposed that the inclusion of extra comedic scenes might have elevated the overall quality of the film's presentation.\nIn February 2015, Almeida was cast in the role of Ashmusao in the tiatr production Pai (Father), directed by Comedian Agostinho. The play went on to win first place at the 6th Tiatr Academy of Goa's Popular Tiatr Festival. The following year, in 2016, Almeida appeared in another tiatr titled Apurbaiechim Fulam (Affectionate Flowers), produced by Lawry Travasso. This production was later released on DVD, and Almeida's performance in a comedic role was praised by reviewers. She continued to work in tiatr productions, and in January 2019 she was cast in the play Mera Bharat Mahaan (My India is Great), again directed by Comedian Agostinho. In this production, Almeida performed comedic scenes alongside several other well-known tiatr artists, including Agostinho, Comedian Selvy, Fiona, and Jose de Velsao. While her individual performance was noted, some reviews suggested her c",
    "Former church in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England\nChurch in Lincolnshire, England\nSt George's Church was a medieval parish church in the city of Lincoln in Lincolnshire, England. It was built around 1100 and served as one of the many parish churches for the city and surrounding area until 1499, when it was demolished. The site of the church and churchyard is now under a car park and partly occupied by the Lincoln Museum.\nHistory\nLincoln Museum occupies part of the estimated site of St Georges Church and its churchyard\nThe church was originally built around 1100 and had a churchyard. The church was located to the south of Lincoln Cathedral and it was located in the Abbey parish of the city but had few worshippers: roughly ten parishioners at a time. Around 1461, the parish was merged with St Michael's, and as a result the church was later demolished. The church was also built on land that was owned by Vives of Norwich, Elias Martrin's son, Issac Martrin and other land owners.\nPresent day\nSwallowbeck St George's Church, uses the same name as St George's Church, Lincoln\nThe site of the church and churchyard is now occupied by a car park and the Lincoln Museum. There is also a church in the suburb of Swallowbeck using the same name of the church, St George's Church.\nReferences\n^ \"Monument record MLI89655 - Site of St George's Church and Churchyard\".

    "Painting by Jan Willem Pieneman\nThe Battle of Waterloo (Dutch: De Slag bij Waterloo) is a large history painting by the Dutch artist Jan Willem Pieneman completed in 1824. It portrays the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 which marked the final defeat of Napoleon's French Empire and the end of the Napoleonic Wars. It focuses on the Allied commanders led by the Duke of Wellington.\nFollowing the success of his 1818 work The Prince of Orange at Quatre Bras the artist chose to depict another scene from the Hundred Days campaign. He traveled to London in February 1821 where he received assistance from the Duke of Wellingon who let him establish a temporary studio in Apsley House and posed for his own portrait. He also arranged sittings with other senior figures present at Waterloo and in addition had his horse Copenhagen brought to London so that Pieneman could capture its likeness. After spending nearly  nearly four months in London the artist returned to Amsterdam where he also painted the Prince of Orange in preparation for the work.\nThe work itself took almost three years to complete. Measuring eighteen and a half by twenty seven feet it was a giant canvas. It depicts the scene at the moment news reaches Wellington that Prussian forces under Blucher are arriving on the battlefield. The focus is on the Allies, particularly the British, the Dutch and Belgians of the Netherlands and the King's German Legion of Hanover. Wellington is the central figure of the scene, mounted on Copenhagen. The Prince of Orange is in the bottom left hand corner of the painting, wounded and being carried on a stretcher. Other figures portrayed include Lord Uxbridge, Rowland Hill and Miguel Ricardo de \u00c1lava. Behind them the battle rages on. To the left a British cavalryman waves a captured French Eagle in the air.\nAlthough Wellington may have planned to acquire the painting to hang at his country estate Stratfield Saye, it was bought instead by the Prince of Orange for 40,000 guilders. The sum was actually paid by his father William I as a gift for his son and heir. As a condition of the sale, Pieneman insisted that he be allowed to exhibit the painting in London.\nDue to the painting's large size it was decided to construct a specially-built pavilion in Hyde Park. This opened in early May 1825 proved very popular with the British public who turned out in large numbers. The work was on display for around ten months in total including the tenth anniversary of the battle on 18 June 1825. It was also exhibited in Brussels and Ghent. It is now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the largest work in the collection. Smaller versions exist at Apsley House and Cirencester Park in Gloucestershire where a copy was given to Wellington's political ally Lord Bathurst.\nReferences\n^ Reynolds p. 167\n^ Reynolds p.68\n^ Reynolds p. 168\n^ Wellesley p.200\n^ Reynolds p.168\n^ Reynolds p.168-70\n^ Wellesley p.58\n^ https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-1115\n^ Thompson p.233\nBibliography\nReynolds, Luke.

    "\nThe Battle of Ganzak was a clash between the Byzantine and Sasanian armies. The emperors of both empires personally took part in this battle. As a result, the Persians suffered a crushing defeat, and Khosrow fled leaving his army. As a result of this, Heraclius was able to move deeper into Persia.\nBackground\nAfter Khosrow refused the peace treaty, sending an insulting letter in response. Using Khosrow's letter as a tool of inspiration and propaganda for his army, Heraclius marched on Caucasus. Already on the way, he learned that Khosrow was with 40,000 soldiers in Ganzak.\nKhosrow's letter looked like this:\nChosroes, honored among the gods, lord and king of all the earth, offspring of the great Aramazd, to Heraclius, our senseless and insignificant servant. You have not wished to submit yourself to us, but you call yourself lord and king. My treasure which is with you, you spend; my servants you defraud; and having collected an army of brigands, you give me no rest. So did I not destroy the Greeks? But you claim to trust in your God. Why did he not save Caesarea and Jerusalem, and the great Alexandria' from my hands? Do you not know that I have subjected to myself the sea and the dry land? So is it only Constantinople that I shall not be able to erase? However, I shall forgive you all your trespasses. Arise, take your wife and children and come here. I shall give you estates, vineyards, and olive-trees, whereby you may make a living. And we shall look upon you with friendship. Let not your vain hopes deceive you. For that Christ who was not able to save himself from the Jews - but they killed him by hanging him on a cross - how can the same save you from my hands? 'For if you descend into the depths of the sea,' I shall stretch out my hand and seize you. And then you will see me in a manner you will not desire.\nBattle\nHeraclius sent the faithful Arabs forward, who defeated the guards of the Sasanian king. After this, Khosrow fled to the south, and Heraclius killed the remnants of his troops.\nAftermath\nKhosrow fled south to Dastagard, where his army finally dispersed. At this time, Heraclius took Ganzak, and after that he burned the famous temple Takht-i-Suleiman. Heraclius raided the region of Atrpatakan, as far as the King's residence at Gayshawan and continued his campaign.\nReference\n^ Greatrex 1991, p.\u00a0200.\n^ Kaegi 2003, pp.\u00a0126\u2013127.\n^ a b Kaegi 2003, p.\u00a0127.\nBibliography\nKaegi, Walter Emil (2003), Heraclius: Emperor of Byzantium, Cambridge University Press, ISBN\u00a0978-0-521-81459-1\nGreatrex, Geoffrey (1991).

    "American soldier\nJohn Malcolm Smith (April 2, 1922 \u2013 June 9, 1981) was an American combat pilot who was a United States Navy fighter ace during World War II. He was credited with shooting down 10 enemy aircraft during the war. Smith received his law degree in 1950 and served in the United States Naval Reserve until his retirement in 1972.\nEarly life\nSmith was born in Owatonna, Minnesota, on April 2, 1922 and graduated from Owatonna High School in 1939. He briefly attended Saint Mary's College in Winona, Minnesota, before he enlisted in the Navy in 1942.\nMilitary career\nSmith enlisted for flight training on May 22, 1942, and became a qualified naval aviator on June 1, 1943. He was commissioned as an ensign that same day. He was assigned to fighter squadron VF-17 in December which was flying the Chance Vought F4U Corsair in the South Pacific. The unit was in reserve at that time to rest and receive replacements; new pilots received 50 hours of advanced flight training during this time that incorporated the lessons learned from the squadron's first combat tour. The squadron flew to Torokina Airfield on Bougainville Island on January 24, 1944, to begin combat missions as part of the Allied campaign to neutralize the Japanese fortress at Rabaul, New Guinea.\nThe following day, VF-17 were part of the 88 Allied fighters assigned to escort a large group of Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers as they attacked Lakunai Airfield. The Japanese intercepted them with 92 fighters of their own and claimed to have destroyed 48 aircraft for the loss of 6 of their own. VF-17 claimed to have shot down 22 fighters in exchange for 2 Corsairs shot down, the only fighter losses suffered by the Allies that mission. The Allied aircraft returned to Lakunai on the morning of 27 January as 19 North American B-25 Mitchell bombers were escorted by 64 Allied fighters. The Japanese intercepted with 30\u201340 fighters. They claimed to have shot down 23 Allied fighters while losing 6. Allied fighter claims and losses mirrored the Japanese claims at 23 shot down for 6 lost. VF-17 contributed 8 fighters to the escort for the small airstrike against Lakunai later that afternoon that the Japanese did not attack. This established the pattern for the squadron's deployment on Bougainville; escorting bombers conducting daily attacks on targets around Rabaul such as Lanakai, Vunakanau and Tobera Airfields. Smith claimed a Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter probably destroyed on 29 January during a mission targeting Tobera that saw the Americans claim 17 Japanese fighters destroyed in the air although the Japanese only lost 5.\nReferences\n^ Staff\n^ a b c Olynyk, p. 562\n^ Cleaver, p. 267\n^ Blackburn, pp. 173\u2013174, 177\u2013178\n^ Blackburn, p. 185\n^ Dunn, pp. 527\u2013528\n^ Blackburn, pp. 203\u2013204\nBibliography\nBlackburn, Tom (1989).

    "In this Basque name, the first surname is  Medrano and the second is  Castej\u00f3n.\nGarc\u00eda de Medrano y Castej\u00f3n (c. 1550 \u2013 1604) was a noble from the House of Medrano, lord of San Gregorio, a Knight of the Order of Santiago, author, lawyer, criminal judge in the Royal Audience and Chancery of Granada, prosecutor and minister of the Council of Orders, a member of the Royal Council of Castile and the Royal Council of Justice, and procurator in the Cortes for the city of Soria.\nFamily background\nThe ancient and noble House of Medrano is recognized as one of the most powerful in the Sierra de Cameros and in Soria. The Medrano family, Lords of Cabanillas and Lords of San Gregorio, and Lords of many other entailed estates of the Medrano lineage in Soria and its region, are knights of great antiquity and nobility. The House of Medrano are listed under the Salvadores and Barnuevo lineages, incorporating them into the ancient 12 lineages of Soria . The House of Medrano managed their Lordships and maintained their main resources, maize cultivation and especially sheep farming.\nFor the first six years of his life, Garc\u00eda de Medrano y Castej\u00f3n lived under the reign of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and subsequently Kings Philip II and Philip III of Spain.\nParents\nGarc\u00eda de Medrano y Castej\u00f3n was born around 1550 in El Burgo de Osma, Soria, to Don Garc\u00eda de Medrano y Vinuesa and Catalina de Castej\u00f3n.\nHis parents were the Lords of San Gregorio, a Lordship and fortified castle in the Diocese of Osma-Soria built by his great-great-grandfather Don Diego L\u00f3pez de Medrano y Vergara, Lord of San Gregorio, in 1461. On September 1, 1552, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, issued the Carta Ejecutoria de Hidalgu\u00eda to confirm the noble status of the Medrano family.\nHis father Don Garcia de Medrano y Vinuesa later played a significant political role: he was a member of the Cortes of Segovia from 1592 to 1593, and the speeches he delivered are preserved in the protocols of those Cortes. In the trial against Don Rodrigo Calder\u00f3n, Marquess of the Seven Churches, judge Don Garcia de Medrano y Vinuesa was one of the few who voted against the Marquis's death.\nEducation\nColegio Mayor de San Bartolom\u00e9 of Salamanca\nGarc\u00eda de Medrano y Castej\u00f3n began his formal education in law at an early age. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Law and was subsequently admitted to the prestigious Colegio Mayor de San Bartolom\u00e9 of Salamanca on March 1, 1573. During his time at the college, he demonstrated exceptional academic skill, quickly obtaining a licentiate degree and a PhD in Law. He remained at the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolom\u00e9 until 1584, when he was appointed to a judicial position.\nAccording to The History of the Old College of San Bartolom\u00e9, as noted by Ruiz y Vergara in Volume II, page 407:\nDon Garc\u00eda de Medrano, a native of San Gregorio..., son of Don Garc\u00eda de Medrano and Do\u00f1a Cathalina Castej\u00f3n, was received on March 1, 1573. He graduated from the College with a degree in Law.\nCareer\nOn February 17, 1584, Garc\u00eda de Medrano y Castej\u00f3n was appointed as a criminal judge (alcalde del Crimen) in the Royal Audience and Chancery of Granada, taking over the position from Licentiate Escobar, who had moved to the Contadur\u00eda Mayor de Hacienda on December 23, 1583. However, during an inspection of the Chancery of Granada in 1591, he was suspended from his duties and exiled to Soria.\nLate career\nEight years later, in 1599, Garc\u00eda de Medrano y Castej\u00f3n's career saw a revival when he was appointed as the prosecutor of the Council of Orders. He was sworn into this position at the court on May 4, 1599. His tenure as prosecutor was brief, as he soon took office as a minister of the Council of Orders on March 3, 1600.\nIn recognition of his service, he was granted the habit of the Order of Santiago in the same year. On 18 August 1604, he left his position in the Council of Orders for a position in the Council of Castile.\nOn February 21, 1604, he was promoted to an extraordinary position in the Royal Council of Castile, remaining in this position until his death. Shortly before his death, he served as a procurator in the Cortes for the city of Soria. On August 23, 1604, while already ill, he requested to be granted the encomienda of Oca\u00f1a of the Order of Santiago.\nCompilation of the Chapter Laws of the Order of Santiago\n\"The rule and establishment of the knighthood of Santiago of the Sword, with the history of its origin and principle thereof\" by Garc\u00eda de Medrano y Castejon (1627 edition)\nIn 1599, Don Garc\u00eda de Medrano y Castej\u00f3n became a knight of the  Order of Santiago. Don Garc\u00eda held a seat in the Council of Orders since March 3, 1600. In 1600, he also received a habit of the Order of Santiago. He authored a book for the Order called \"Regla y establecimientos de la Caballer\u00eda de Santiago de la Espada: Historia y origen de ella,\" printed in Valladolid, by Juan S\u00e1nchez in 1603.\nA second edition of the book was made, entitled \"La regla de la cavalleria de Santia",
    "\n21 Paths to the Kingdom of Darkness (Finnish: 21 polkua pimeyden valtakuntaan) is a collection of essays in Finnish that largely presents the tenets of David Myatt's Order of Nine Angles movement. The movement supports accelerationism, i.e. promoting the collapse of society through terrorism and sabotage. The movement's worldview combines theistic Satanism and far-right ideology; the movement despises the typical forms of Satanism in Western countries. The idea of the Order of Nine Angles, represented by the book 21 Paths to the Kingdom of Darkness, is also marginal in the circles of both esotericists and extreme right-wingers. However, the current gained somewhat more visibility in Finland around the years 2018\u20132024.\nAccording to researcher Jussi Sohlberg, 21 Paths to the Kingdom of Darkness was published in 2018. Myatt's writings were published in Finnish on Ylilauta already in 2017. The translators urged readers to rise up in armed rebellion. The police have regarded the book as a guide on the \"satanic path\" to human sacrifice and terrorism. The author of the Finnish work is unknown, and there may have been several authors. The author of the book is named \"Louhi lodge\", not to be confused with the Louhi Lodge of the Star of Azazel satanist movement that supports civil rights and egalitarianism.\nContents\n21 Paths to the Kingdom of Darkness presents practical tips for planning murders and recommends different ways of doing it. The book suggests supporters of democracy, human dignity and equality, anti-fascists, sex offenders, foreign drug dealers or people called \"economic refugee\" as targets for murder. According to the book itself, it represents a fanatical, elitist and violent world view. The book considers God to be non-existent, but declares a belief in the \"Powers of Darkness\", which are \"forces operating on the acausal level of existence\".\nThe book describes the Sinister Path, to which those who begin the initiation are called \"adepts\". The book describes various rituals, which include, among other things, perpetrating a human sacrifice. In the chapter \"The Culling\" it is argued that human sacrifice is a tradition that unites all of humanity, signs of which have been found all over the world. According to its introduction, 21 Paths to the Kingdom of Darkness seeks to guide people to actions that would bring the current age to its conclusion. At the end of the book, the \"Ceremony of Recalling \" is described, where a 21-year-old man is sacrificed by slitting his throat on the summer solstice every 17 years. The \"Ceremony of Recollection\" is taken from the Grimoire of Baphomet of the Order of Nine Angles. It requires voluntary submission from the human sacrifice and after the murder, pastries are recommended to be made from the victim's blood for ceremonial purposes.\nThe guide also discusses, among other things, learning close combat skills and survivalism.\nPublic hearing and criminal investigations\nThe book attracted attention in Finland after the police linked it to far-right terrorism in their investigations. The book was part of the reading list of the suspects in both the Lahti terrorism case and the Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4 terrorism arrests. The police believed that the leader of the group suspected of terrorism in Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4 had started to go through the path presented in the book. The person who received the longest sentence for the Lahti terrorism case, who talked about the murder of Sanna Marin among other things, had 21 Paths to the Kingdom of Darkness in his possession. The ideological current of the terrorist incident in Lahti was the extreme right trend known as Siege-culture.\nThe author of the book states that he is from the Tampere region and that he was 16 years old in 1996. In the spring and summer of 2023, the police feared that a forty-year-old man from Yl\u00f6j\u00e4rvi was preparing a ritual murder according to the book's teachings. The National Bureau of Investigation monitored the man's phones and watched his home due to the suspicion. The same person was suspected of sending letter bombs to the party offices of Social Democrat, Green and Left party offices in several cities in February 2023. Based on the messages they found on the phone of the man from Yl\u00f6j\u00e4rvi and the nickname \"Herra Kansa\" (Herrenvolk) associated with the man, the police began to suspect that the man from Yl\u00f6j\u00e4rvi had also participated in writing the book. An altar belonging to him was found in a forest. The eventual charges were incitement to commit a crime and illegal threats made with terrorist intent. The man is known to have published satanic fiction, analyses written for a far-right online publication and articles for the Finns Party think tank. He is a former member of Finns Party and had written texts on the party's blog page that have since been deleted. The texts had discussed security issues and accelerationism. Riikka Purra, leader of the Finns Party condemned the plans described by the police and considered them delu",

    "Christian martyr\nEudokia the Martyr (in Ancient Greek: \u0395\u1f50\u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 \u1f21 \u039c\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c2) is a Christian saint and martyr from the 3rd century. According to Christian hagiographic accounts, she was deported along with thousands of other Christians by Shapur I. After strengthening her fellow believers in the face of persecution and converting Persian women, she was reportedly tortured in various ways, imprisoned multiple times, and eventually executed by beheading. She is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, which commemorates her on August 4th. However, some modern Orthodox hagiographers believe she might actually be a fictional character.\nShe should not be confused with the martyr Eudokia of Heliopolis.\nBiography\nHagiographic accounts\nKnown exclusively through Christian hagiographic accounts, which begin with her capture by the Persians, she is believed to have originated from Asia Minor or Anatolia. After being captured along with a relatively large number of Christians, up to 9,000, during a military campaign by Shapur I, Eudokia was reportedly deported to Persia and placed in the service of a Persian officer's family. Through her Christian actions, she managed to soften her captors before converting them. She then became involved in providing moral support to other deported Christians and in converting many Persian women. These activities attracted the wrath of the Persian authorities, who flogged her before imprisoning her for two months. After these two months, she reportedly appeared again before the Persian officials and refused once more to renounce Christianity, leading to her being beaten with thorny rods before being sent back to prison for six months. Upon her release, the episode allegedly repeated itself; this time, she would have been bound in thorns pressed against her naked body, tearing away strips of flesh, and then tied to a gibbet with ropes used to break her bones. Finally, the saint was beheaded by her executioners.\nLegacy\nHer memory is celebrated on August 4 by the Eastern Orthodox Church; however, some modern Eastern Orthodox hagiographers express doubts about her existence. They believe she might possibly be confused with Eudokia of Heliopolis.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f \"Martyr Eudokia of Persia\". www.oca.org. Archived from the original on 2024-08-04.

    "Website about potentially active volcanoes in Iceland\nThe Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes (CIV) is a web resource that was created to serve as an official source of information about potentially active volcanoes monitored by Iceland. The creation of the website followed the disruptive 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull and allows access to a database of recent eruptions and their details. The website's design was subsequently used in creating the website European Catalogue of Volcanoes that covers a larger area, and which has much, but not all the functionality of the Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes.\nCurrent Status\nThe website displays information on 32 Icelandic volcanic systems in English or Icelandic. It also provides information on the Beerenberg volcano.\nHistory\nVolcano observatory functionality in Iceland was prior to the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption partially joint funded by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) The initial June 2010 meeting of the International Volcanic Ash Task Force (IVATF), created by the ICAO after the eruption, had a working paper on improvement of volcanic monitoring and advice presented by the World Organization of Volcano Observatories that recommended increased support for the volcano observatories of the world.\nSeed funding originally came from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2010, for what was projected as a 3-year project to collate relevant knowledge and create a comprehensive catalogue readily available to decision makers, stakeholders and the general public. In September 2011 this project analysing and categorising volcanic activity in Iceland was noted to be beneficial for the larger long term risk assessment project funded by the Icelandic government. Later funding also came from the European Commission with the FUTUREVOLC project.\nBy 2012 the task mainly financed by the ICAO, to improve the knowledge and behaviour information in the then catalogue of Icelandic volcanoes supplemented by information about ash particle grain-size distribution was reported to be underway.\nPrepublication extracts of the new catalogue were being used by 2014.\nThe web site was showcased in April 2015 to praise and a beta version launched later that year with data on B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga, Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn, Hekla and Katla.\nThe website was launched formally internationally in 2016, and is official. The Global Volcanism Program website recognises it as an additional web resource.\nIn 2019 the Icelandic version of the website was launched.\nBy November 2020 the almost identically formatted Catalogue of European Volcanoes website went live, initially with information on active volcanoes or volcanic areas monitored by France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain as well as Iceland.\nIn 2024 the two websites were recognised in a peer-reviewed academic paper on tephra dispersion as important resources for modelling this. As of 2024, of the two similar websites, only the Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes has an additional data portal functionality.\nSee also\nVolcanoes portal\nReferences\n^ a b c d Engwell et al. 2024, Section:Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes (CIV).\n^ \"Contributors\".

    "\nThomas Benton Smith was an American judge serving for 20 years in the federal and state courts of Florida. He inspired the creation of Florida's first specialized business court, and was considered a leader on improving the quality and efficiency of business litigation.\nJudicial service\nState court judge\nIn December 2001, Florida Governor Jeb Bush appointed Smith as a judge of Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court, covering Orange and Osceola Counties. He was later successfully elected as a circuit court judge. He served as a circuit court judge from early 2002 until 2011, when he became a Magistrate Judge in the United States District Court of the Middle District of Florida. He was replaced on the Ninth Circuit by John Jordan.\nSmith first served in the court's criminal division and then its domestic division. During his early time on the court, in 2003, Smith pursued the concept with Chief Judge Belvin Perry of establishing a specialized business court in the Ninth Circuit. This would be a specialized court program with jurisdiction over complex business and commercial cases, with a single judge hearing the case from beginning to end. Smith's goal was to \"give Orlando-area businesses greater certainty, consistency and efficiency in the courtroom -- with judges who know business law, make consistent rulings and move cases through the system quickly.\"\nLater in 2003, Perry issued orders creating the Specialized Business Court Sub-Division of the Civil Division of the Circuit Court, which would become operational in January 2004.  This was the first functioning business court in Florida's state court system. Judge Renee A. Roche served as the first business court judge. In 2009, Smith himself served as the Ninth Circuit's Business Court judge. The Ninth Circuit Business Court inspired other Florida circuits to create their own business courts.\nNationally, Smith was a founder and director of the American College of Business Court Judges (ACBCJ), and he, Perry, and Roche all participated in the first meeting of the ACBCJ in 2005.\nWhile a Florida state court judge, the Florida Supreme Court made him the first chair of its newly established Committee on Standard Jury Instruction\u2013Contract and Business Cases.\nFederal judiciary\nIn 2011, the Judges of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida unanimously selected Smith to serve as a Magistrate Judge for the Middle District of Florida. He retired from that position in 2019, but was recalled for two more years, fully retiring in 2021.\nThe position of federal magistrate judge was created by Congress in 1968. Magistrate judges are federal judicial officers, but they are appointed by a vote of United States District Court Judges in a judicial district, rather than by the President of the United States and the United States Senate. Although not as broad as the powers held by district court judges, magistrate judges have a wide range of authority, and can even preside as judges over civil trials if the parties all agree. Among their many functions, they often entertain pretrial motions and hearings.\nSmith was considered \"a pioneer known both statewide and nationally for his cutting edge innovations in the field of business litigation\" in part based on his expertise in addressing developing technologies and electronic discovery.  As a magistrate judge, his written decisions on discovery of electronically stored information have been looked to for guidance on grasping issues dealing with this type of technical discovery.\nMore generally to all cases, Smith provided the following advice in a 2019 federal judicial order, on how opponents should and should and should not communicate during the litigation process: \"Both sides need to learn that frequently the best response to immature behavior is to ignore it. Don't react, don't sink to the other side's level, don't try to fight fire with fire. There are disagreements in every case, that is what litigation is about. Most adversaries work out their disagreements while remaining calm and professional.\"\nLegal practice\nSmith was admitted to the Florida bar in 1978, and began his legal career as a solo practitioner that same year. He became an Assistant State Attorney in Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit in 1979. In 1982, he became a business litigator at the private law firm of Maguire, Voorhis & Wells, P.A. for 16 years. In 1998, he became a law partner at the national and international law firm Holland & Knight, LLP.\nEducation\nSmith obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of South Florida in 1974, and his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Florida College of Law (now the University of Florida Levin College of Law) in 1977.\nPositions and honors\nSmith has held the following positions and received the following honors, among others;\nMember (20 years), Executive Council of the Business Law Section of the Florida Bar\nFirst chair appointed to Florida Supreme Court Committee on Standard Ju",
    "A Military Government Junta briefly ruled Guatemala from 24 to 26 October 1957. Its members were:\nColonel \u00d3scar Mendoza Azurdia\nColonel Roberto Lorenzana Salazar\nColonel Gonzalo Yurrita Nova\n1957 Guatemalan coup\n\u00d3scar Mendoza Azurdia, chairman of military juntaGonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez, the deposed president\nOn July 26, 1957, General Castillo Armas, the president of Guatemala, was assassinated by a presidential guard. His vice-president, civilian Luis Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez, was designated provisional president and sworn in the following day. Gonz\u00e1lez's goal as interim president and first presidential designate was to call elections within 4 months.\nThe presidential elections were called on October 20, which gave victory to the civilian Miguel Ortiz Passareli against the military Miguel Yd\u00edgoras Fuentes. General Yd\u00edgoras denounced the results as electoral fraud. Protests and riots by Yd\u00edgoras supporters broke out across the country. The Guatemalan government declared a 30-day state of siege. On October 23, Colonel Juan Francisco Oliva and the army pressured President Gonz\u00e1lez to hold new elections to settle the crisis.\nThe electoral impasse ended abruptly on October 24. A new military movement or coup forced the resignation of Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez. A group of 80 officers marched into the National Palace. Under pressure from Defense Minister Juan Francisco Oliva, President Gonz\u00e1lez resigned. That night, a long meeting with hundreds of military officers of the Guatemalan army discussed the formation of a military junta. Finally, a three-man junta composed of colonels \u00d3scar Mendoza Azurdia, Roberto Lorenzana and Gonzalo Yurrita Nova seized power.\nFollowing the coup, the election results were nullified by the Guatemalan junta. Guatemala's congress refused to recognize the military junta, leading to another impasse. The Guatemalan Congress sent a delegation to consult with Ambassador Sparks and General Yd\u00edgoras on a plan to replace the deposed President Gonz\u00e1lez with his second presidential designate, Guillermo Flores Avenda\u00f1o.\nIn mediation with the junta, General Yd\u00edgoras called on his supporters to stop the demonstrations to solve the crisis. On October 26, the Guatemalan junta agreed to hand over the presidency to Colonel Flores Avenda\u00f1o. Another election was called in 1958, in which General Yd\u00edgoras\u00a0was elected by congress after a political impasse in which none of the candidates received a majority of the votes.\nReferences\n^ \"Our leaders in the period 1954 to 1986 (Guatemala)\".

    "Social media debate\nIllustration of the \"bear\" scenario on the left and the \"man\" scenario on the right\n\"Man or bear\" (also called \"man vs. bear\") is a viral social media debate and Internet meme centered on a scenario for women to consider: whether they would prefer to be alone in the woods with a man or a bear. The meme originates from a popular TikTok video by Screenshot HQ posted in April 2024. The prominence of responses choosing the bear has been associated with the widespread violence against women.\nBackground\nThe meme originated from a TikTok video published by Screenshot HQ in April 2024 which interviewed eight women on the question, with seven out of them picking the bear. The post went viral and gained over 16 million views in two months.\nResponse\nOnline reception\nThe online reception to the Screenshot HQ video was divided. Most women responded to the meme saying they would also choose the bear. One of the main reasons they chose this answer was that men are more likely to commit sexual violence against women than bears. Other popular arguments included that bears are unable to commit acts worse than murder, that they are more predictable, and that they treat women as people.\nWhen posed the same question, many men also chose the bear. Many men also negatively responded to the common choice of the bear among women.\nCommentary from journalists\nSome journalists compared the response of women sharing their assault experiences online with the #MeToo movement. Femi Oluwole of The Independent argued that the debate showed that men need to be more informed about the dangers women face in society. Journalists highlighted various murder cases such as Grace Millane's and Futura Junko's.\nRachel Ulatowski of the feminist magazine The Mary Sue called men's backlash to women picking the bear \"bizarre\" and \"laughable\" due to weak arguments with misused statistics and claims of misandry. Some journalists compared it to the #NotAllMen meme. Clarissa-Jan Lim of MSNBC argued that discussion focusing on the actual hostility of bears misses the point, which she said was the \"dangers that women experience in  world\" with men.\nWilfred Reilly of the National Review criticized the bear-favoring statistics people shared as an example of the base rate fallacy that he stated was widespread in modern American politics. Megan McArdle of The Washington Post argued that those statistics were a confusion of the inverse fallacy that \"reinforce harmful stereotypes\" of women being \"irrational, neurotic and bad at math\".\nLegacy\nLater in July, the influencer Amanda Wylie shared a video to TikTok about her encounter with a bear in the woods. She compared it to the \"man or bear\" meme, saying she would still \"choose the bear\". In addition, the influencer Sir Carter referenced the meme in the most viral LGBT TikTok of mid-2024.\nKayleigh Donaldson of Paste associated the novel Bear (1976) by Marian Engel with the meme. According to Tamlyn Avery of The Conversation, Julia Phillips's 2024 book Bear alludes to the debate during a scene with the main character Sam at a family funeral.\nStatistics\nThe World Health Organization states that one in three women face sexual or physical violence in their lifetime, overwhelmingly by men. In contrast, there have been 664 bear attacks over fifteen years with most being non-fatal, which means bear attacks are far less common. Bear expert Jean-Jacques Camarra says that bears have evolved to fear humans, and would therefore most likely run away.\nReferences\n^ a b c d Murray, Conor. \"Man Or Bear?

    "Hospital in Attica, GreeceThe General Hospital of Athens \"Elpis\" is a hospital in the center of Athens. It is the oldest active hospital in the country.\nThe foundation stone of the Municipal Hospital of Athens \"Elpis\" was laid in June 1836 at 50 Akadimias Street, where today the Spiritual Center of the Municipality of Athens is housed. The plans were by the German architect F. Stauffert, with some modifications by his compatriot Eduard Schaubert (1804\u20131860). The construction was undertaken by the Danish architect Christian Hansen, making some additional modifications. The central part of the building was completed in 1842, through the support of fundraisers and donations from King Ludwig of Bavaria (Otto's father), the Duchess of Plaisance and many other Greeks such as Konstantinos Bellios, Alexandros Mavrokordatos, Konstantinos Galatis, Rallou Mourouzi and others.\nIt operated on Akadimias Street until 1971 when it moved to its current premises, on Dimitsanas Street in Ampelokoipoi, just behind the refugee camps on Alexandra Avenue. A relocation that was considered as far back as 1892 and was initially attempted in June 1904, with the foundation stone of the new hospital building being laid on the then municipal plot of Ampelokoipoi. However, the relocation to the new building will take place about 70 years later as it will be used initially by the Hellenic Red Cross for the care of the wounded of the Balkan Wars and then handed over to the Ministry of Defense.\nIn the hospital many figures of the medical science of Greece started their medical careers who later participated in the establishment of many of the newest hospitals in Athens, such as Theodoros Aretaios, Spyridon Magginas, Nikolaos Makkas, Marinos Geroulanos, Alivizatos and others. He treated, among others, the wounded of the 1893 war, the Thessalian and Cretan refugees, the wounded of the Balkan Wars, the Asia Minor refugees, the soldiers of the Greco-Italian War and the Athenians during the famine of the occupation.\nIt has been part of the National Health System since 1983.\nReferences\n^ \u0397 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae - \u03a4\u03b1 \u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\n^ \u039d\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u0395\u039b\u03a0\u0399\u03a3.

    "Theatrical comedy by Miguel M. Abrah\u00e3o\nAlta-Sociedade is a theatrical comedy in two acts, written by Brazilian dramatist Miguel M. Abrah\u00e3o in 1978 and published first in 1982 in Brazil.\nPlot summary\nRich widow, Jandira Prates Gouveia de Morais, 87 years old, sacrifices her wealth by maintaining a romantic relationship with the \u201cbon vivant\u201d Lulu, 22 years old. Daughter Jussara L\u00edlian and granddaughter L\u00edlian Jussara vehemently oppose this exploitative relationship and end up being admitted to a psychiatric hospital on the elderly woman's orders. Years later, the two women, guided by lawyers and supported by a medical report, return to the mansion to demand their rights and, this time, willing to banish Jandira if necessary. The problem is that the treatment given by the hospital to two women with excellent mental health left L\u00edlian Jussara and Jussara L\u00edlian with sequelae and personality disorders. Their return to the Prates de Morais mansion will provoke radical twists that will involve the butler Alfred, the fashion designer Rangel and the enemy lawyers, identical triplet brothers, in a hilarious plot and surprising ending.\nBibliography\nCOUTINHO, Afr\u00e2nio; SOUSA, J.

    "Shipping route across the Bass Strait\nFor the former designation along the Atlantic Seaboard, see Ocean Highway.\nFor the former state highway in New Jersey created in 1909, see Ocean Highway (New Jersey).\nA container ship in the Port of Melbourne\nThe Sea Highway is an Australian colloquialism and figurative shipping route used to describe the sea lines of communication between the state of Victoria on the Australian mainland and island state of Tasmania across the Bass Strait.\nSince the mid-1970s, there have been measures taken by the Australian Government to formalise and integrate the Sea Highway into the nation's National Highway network as a means to ensure equal transport opportunities and economic integration across the entire country.\nBackground\nSee also: History of tariffs in Australia, Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme, and Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme\nThe Princess of Tasmania in 1958\nAs an island, Tasmania heavily relies on maritime trade to sustain its communities and economy, with a dependency on interstate shipping that is two and a half times greater than any other Australian state.\nBefore federation, the Colony of Tasmania depended on intercolonial tariffs for revenue. However, post-federation, only the Commonwealth could impose tariffs, and only on overseas goods. During the 1898 referendum, Tasmania's Premier, Edward Braddon, fought to ensure continued tariff revenue for the colony. The referendum failed in the Colony of New South Wales, leading to a 'secret' Premiers' conference where amendments were agreed upon. These amendments, known as the \"Braddon Clause,\" became Section 87 of the Constitution of Australia, enabling the return of revenue from customs and excise to the states.\nThe term \"Sea Highway\" was being used colloquially to describe the merchant shipping route by the early 20th century. The premise of the \"Sea Highway\" became popularised following the advent of the MS Princess of Tasmania ferry services departing the Port of Melbourne. The MS Princess of Tasmania was the largest roll-on/roll-off passenger ship in the southern hemisphere at its launch in the 1950s and greatly enhanced Tasmania's popularity as a tourism destination.\nWith over 99% of Tasmania's freight by volume moved by sea, the federal government introduced the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme in 1976 to assist subsiding shipping costs. The Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme was implemented in 1996 to further subsidise passenger shipping costs.\nNational Highway subsidy rationale\nPort of Burnie in 2008\nShipping goods to and from Tasmania involves additional costs compared to road or rail transport on the mainland. These costs include fuel, freight charges, and the need for specialised transport infrastructure like sea ports and ferries. Additionally, Tasmania's smaller population and economy mean there is less demand for goods and services compared to larger states. This lower demand can lead to higher per-unit costs for goods and services due to less bulk purchasing and production.\nAs Australia's National Highway System is federally funded, except for the sea route to Tasmania, advocates for the Sea Highway seek for its formal recognition as part of the National Highway based on transport equity, aiming to enhance sea connections between Tasmania and mainland Australia. Similar to land highways that connect Australian regions, such as the Eyre Highway or Hume Highway, the Sea Highway requires considerable federal support to provide reliable, affordable services crucial for Tasmania's economic activities and smooth Bass Strait transportation.\nSea Highway operators\nThe Sea Highway is routinely traversed by several shipping and ferry companies that provide vital transport and logistics services to Tasmania and its Bass Strait islands. Major Tasmanian ports include Devonport, Burnie, Bell Bay and the Port of Launceston. These shipping companies play a primary role in Tasmania\u2019s economy, handling both passenger and freight services, supporting industries such as agriculture, retail, and manufacturing, while also maintaining the flow of essential goods and services. These companies collectively ensure connectivity between Tasmania and the Australian mainland. \nTT-Line Company\nPrimarily known for passenger and vehicle ferry services, TT-Line Company ferries MVs Spirit of Tasmania I and Spirit of Tasmania II, operate between Geelong, Victoria and Devonport, Tasmania. The vessels also transport freight, including commercial vehicles, trailers, and other large cargo. \nSeaRoad Holdings\nSeaRoad Holdings specialises in freight services across the Bass Strait. SeaRoad ships cargo between Melbourne and Devonport, including a variety of goods such as containers, heavy machinery, and refrigerated cargo on MVs SeaRoad Mersey II and Liekut, both modern roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) vessels.\nStrait Link\nFormally part of Toll Domestic Forwarding, Strait Link provides extensive freight services wi",
    "Ambassadors of Austria to South Africa\nThe Ambassador of the Republic of Austria to South Africa is the Republic of Austria's foremost diplomatic representative in South Africa. As head of Austria's diplomatic mission there, the ambassador is the official representative of the president and government of Austria to the Prime Minister and the government of South Africa.

    "Pioneer of monotheism in pre-Islamic Arabia\nUmayyah ibn Ab\u012b as-\u1e62alt (Arabic: \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0644\u062a) was a poet of pre-Islamic Arabia who advocated for monotheism instead of the worship of idols. He was thought to be a member of the Banu Thaqif tribe, with Qurayshi descent on his maternal side. During the rise of Islam, Umayya is said to have become a claimant to prophethood and rivalled Muhammad, which earned him a controversial position in Islamic tradition.\nBiography\nUmayya was born in Taif. His full name is Umayya ibn Abi as-Salt al-Thaqafi, and his full lineage is Umayya ibn Abi as-Salt ibn Abdullah ibn Abi Rabi'ah ibn 'Awf ibn Thaqif. Hence, his lineage is traced back to the tribe of Banu Thaqif. His mother was a woman named Ruqayya, the great-granddaughter of the Arabian patriarch Qusayy ibn Kilab, thus maternally he has descent from the Quraysh.\nReligious beliefs\nSee also: Monotheism in pre-Islamic Arabia\nUmayya believed in monotheism, and rejected the worship of idols that classical tradition has described as being prevalent amongst his contemporaries. According to 11th-century historian Ibn Asakir, Umayya lived during the rise of Islam in the 7th century but refused to convert either out of spite, hatred, or confusion; all three reasons have been presented in the Tarikh Dimashq. In the Tazkirul Quran, it is stated that Umayya was an opponent of Muhammad who also claimed Prophethood out of jealousy when he realized the revelation was not given to him. Hadith scholar Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani affirms that Umayya did not accept Islam at all until his death in 626 CE (the ninth year of the Hijra).\nPoetry\nMain article: Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry\nIn 1934\u20131936, the Lebanese scholar Bashir Yamut collected several poems attributed to Umayya, compiling them in a book known as the D\u012bw\u0101n Umayyah ibn Ab\u012b al-\u1e62alt. Another Diwan has also been published in Beirut, Lebanon by Dar Sadr in 1998. The authenticity of the poems and its attribution to Umayya have been put into question.\nThemes\nAs a poet, Umayya wrote poems on the pre-Islamic wars, such as the wars between the Aws and Khazraj and the Basus War between the Banu Bakr and Banu Taghlib. In his Diwan, the poetry featured there focuses on themes of wisdom and beauty.\nComparison to the Quran\nUmayya's poetry overlaps with some of the content of the Quran. Both Umayya and the Quran treat similar prominent topics in the domains of creation, eschatology, and episodes of biblical prophetology. For example, both treat the story of the tribe of Thamud and the she-camel. Likewise, both include the idea that demons or jinn attempt to ascend to the firmament before being pelted by heavenly defense systems.\nSee also\nIlyas ibn Mudar\nWaraqah ibn Nawfal\nZayd ibn Amr\nReferences\n^ a b c Ibn Kathir (1 January 2015). \"On the news of Umayya ibn Abi as-Salt\".

As a scholar at the Institute he authored the Hungarian chapters in the monumental History of the Eastern European Literatures after WW II (in the second volume his co-author was Yury Gusev\u00a0).\nAt the same time, Viacheslav Sereda started his collaboration with the prominent Soviet publishing houses Khudozhestvennaya Literatura and Raduga as an editor and literary translator. In the 1980s Sereda edited collections of Tibor D\u00e9ry, Andor Endre Gell\u00e9ri, Gyula Kr\u00fady, S\u00e1ndor We\u00f6res, and other Hungarian authors.\nWith the start of a new political epoch in Russia in 1992 when state archives started opening, Viacheslav Sereda plunged into documents related to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and published such important collections of documents as The Soviet Union and the Hungarian Crisis of 1956 in Russian and Hi\u00e1nyz\u00f3 lapok 1956 t\u00f6rt\u00e9net\u00e9b\u0151l (ISBN 963-11-7085-3  1993) and D\u00f6nt\u00e9s a Kremlben, 1956.

Works by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai , the third of contemporary Hungarian literary giants, followed: Sereda's Russian Satantango was published in 2016 and  The Melancholy of Resistance in 2019. Sereda's translation of Baron Wenckheim's Homecoming remained unfinished.\nAs an editor, Viacheslav Sereda produced in 2002 collection of essays Hungarians and Europe that showed how close Hungarians were to the Russians in their very problematic belonging to Europe. In 2005, he compiled and edited the largest collection of Attila J\u00f3zsef's poetry available in Russian. Till his last days Sereda thought of how to keep publishing Russian translations of the authors he worked with \u2013 thus, the Russian volume of P\u00e9ter N\u00e1das' essays on art The Lady in Gold  was published in St. Petersburg in 2023.\nBesides, Viacheslav Sereda translated into Russian works by Lajos Parti Nagy, Istv\u00e1n Orosz, P\u00e9ter G\u00e1rdos, G\u00e9za Sz\u0151cs, \u00c1d\u00e1m N\u00e1dasdy, Gy\u00f6rgy Spir\u00f3, and many others.\nAwards\nIn 1998 Viacheslav Sereda was awarded the Imre Nagy memorial plaque for his research on the Hungarian revolution of 1956.

    "Former movie theater in Hollywood, Los Angeles\nThis article is about the former theater in Hollywood, California. For other uses, see Ritz Theatre.\nHollywood's Ritz Theatre, formerly News View Theatre, Newsreel Theatre, Hollywood Newsreel, New View Theatre, Pacific New View, Pussycat Theatre, and briefly Hologram USA Theater, is a historic former newsreel and movie theater located at 6656 W. Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California.\nHistory\nThe building that would become the Ritz Theatre was originally built for retail in 1930. In 1939\u20131940, it was repurposed into the 386-seat News View Theatre (also known as Newsreel Theater), designed by Norton & Wallis and featuring a streamline moderne interior and art deco lettering on its exterior.\nThe theater opened on May 2, 1940, boasting a policy of screening newsreels air-expressed from New York in 15 hours and London in 40. The theater's first screening included views of the siege of Warsaw, a special reel that applied words of Washington to European events of the day, and lighter fare such as sports, woman's issues, Lew Lehr commenting on bathing beauties, and various other items. The Bear's Tale, a Merrie Melodies cartoon, was also screened, as was Carey Wilson's commentary on A Door Will Open and Pete Smbth's Spots Before Your Eyes.\nBy 1944, the theater was owned by ABC Theatres. In 1949, the theater starting going by Hollywood Newsreel, and in 1954, it changed its name to New View Theatre as it transitioned from newsreels to features. In 1968, Pacific Theatres acquired the theater and renamed it Pacific New View, and the theatre was renovated, including the addition of a snack bar, in 1969.\nIn 1974, the theater was taken over by the porno theater chain Pussycat Theaters, where Deep Throat would play for more than ten years, ending in 1989. Additionally, from August 1977 to January 1978, the theater's neighbor housed Los Angeles's first punk rock club in its basement, with a secondary access point through a staircase from this theatre.\nIn 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and while this theater is in the district, it was not listed as a contributing or non-contributing property.\nIn 1989, the theater became the Ritz Theatre, which closed in 1991. It was managed by Johnny Legend and Eric Caidin.\nIn 1994, the theater became a church, which closed in 2015. In November 2017, the building was reopened by Alki David as Hologram USA Theater, which closed one year later.\nIn 2020, the building was used as a marijuana lounge.\nIn popular culture\nThis theater has been featured in numerous films, including Lethal Weapon, Alex in Wonderland, Death Wish II, Exit Through the Gift Shop, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e \"News-View / New-View / Pussycat / Ritz Theatre\". losangelestheatres.blogspot.com.

    "Nauruan sprinter\nWinzar Jedidiah Shadrack Kakiouea (born 30 April 2001) is a Nauruan sprinter. He qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympics and was the only Nauruan selected.\nBiography\nKakiouea was born on 30 April 2001 in Nauru. He is of the Iruwa tribe. Nauru, with a population of around 10,000, is the world's third-smallest country and does not have a single racetrack, only what Kakiouea called a \"dirt oval\". He grew up in the country and won a national powerlifting competition, also being one of Nauru's top Australian rules football players, although he told The New York Times his accomplishments were \"not so impressive. Nauru is very small.\" Outside of sport, he works as a telecom cable repairman.\nKakiouea competed at the 2018 Melanesian Championships in Athletics, placing fifth in the 100 metres, and won a silver medal at the 2018 Micronesian Games in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay. He also participated in the 100 metres at the 2019 Oceania Athletics Championships, placing fourth. He holds the national record in the event and began training regularly in 2021; The New York Times noted that: smallness \u2014 most everyone knows each other, or at least a cousin or two \u2014 compelled Kakiouea to hide his training regimen, lest people gossip about his ambitions. He stayed away from the dirt oval and went instead into the forested hills, where he shared an earthen straightaway with the occasional car. He had no coach, but a cousin came often to time him. To fortify his body, he ate crab and noddy, a kind of tropical seabird. He fished and sliced the flesh into sashimi slabs.\"\nKakiouea was selected to compete in the 100m at the 2023 World Athletics Championships, where he was the sole Nauruan participating and served as the nation's flag bearer. Later that year, he competed at the Pacific Games in three events, winning a bronze medal in the 100m. In March 2024, he competed in the 60 metres at the 2024 World Athletics Indoor Championships in Glasgow; he trained in Australia to prepare for the competition, purchasing his only pair of running shoes, pink Nike cleats, for 240 Australian dollars.\nIn June 2024, Kakiouea participated at the 2024 Micronesian Games and won four medals \u2013 three gold and one bronze. There, he achieved his personal best in the 100m while winning gold, with a time of 10.82 seconds. The following month, he received a universality selection to compete for Nauru at the 2024 Summer Olympics, being the only Nauruan chosen. At the time, he had a world ranking of 3,701. As the only Nauruan at the games, he served as the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony, joined by his coach and two team officials. He finished sixth in his heat in the men's 100 metres with a time of 11.15s and did not advance.\nReferences\n^ Nauru Electoral Commission (9 November 2021). \"ELECTORAL COMMISSION\" (PDF).

    "\nErnest-Adolphe Bichat, often called Ernest Bichat, born on (1845-09-17)September 17, 1845 in Lun\u00e9ville and died on July 26, 1905(1905-07-26) (aged\u00a059) in Nancy, was a French physicist, member of the Higher Council of Public Instruction, president of the General Council of Meurthe-et-Moselle, dean of the Faculty of Sciences, and correspondent of the institute.\nBiography\nErnest-Adolphe Bichat was born on (1845-09-17)September 17, 1845 in Lun\u00e9ville, the son of Ernest Bichat, a gardener, and Barbe Luce Jeanroy, his wife.\nErnest Bichat proved to be a brilliant student, first at the school in Flainval, then at the college in Lun\u00e9ville. He then prepared for his baccalaureate in Nancy, before being admitted to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in 1866.\nHe married, on 31. of July 1872. at the town hall of the fifth arrondissement of Paris, Marie Eug\u00e9nie H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bertin-Mourot, the daughter of his thesis supervisor. The couple's witnesses were chemist Henri Sainte-Claire Deville, philosopher Ernest Bersot, former Minister of Public Instruction Victor Duruy, all three from the Institut de France, and Louis Pasteur. The couple had three children:\nAlbert, born in 1873 in Paris, a military chief of staff who died in the Somme in 1916, knight of the Legion of Honour.\nHenry, born in 1877 in Nancy, a doctor, mayor of Lun\u00e9ville, general councillor of Meurthe-et-Moselle, officer of the Legion of Honour.\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne-Jeanne, born in 1879 in Nancy, a military officer's wife who, after being widowed, became the Superior of the Hospice des Dames du Calvaire in Paris, knight of the Legion of Honour.\nIn 1889, along with other personalities from Nancy, Bichat participated in the creation of L'Est r\u00e9publicain, a republican newspaper to combat Boulangism. An uncontested leader of the opportunist anti-clerical party of the Lun\u00e9ville district, Ernest-Adolphe Bichat later evolved in the opposite direction and died piously in Nancy on July 26, 1905(1905-07-26) (aged\u00a059).\nMunicipal councillor of Nancy from 1886 to 1892, he was president of the General Council of Meurthe-et-Moselle from 1892 to 1895, where he had been a councillor since 1880.\nAn Officer of Public Instruction, he was a member of the Higher Council of Public Instruction for many years, then appointed correspondent of the Academy of Sciences for the general physics section in 1893 until his death.\nKnighted in 1892, he was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1900.\nScientific career\nThanks to the gradual opening of education provided by the Republic, he accessed higher education despite coming from a modest background. After obtaining his baccalaureate in Sciences in 1863, he entered the special mathematics class at the Lyc\u00e9e de Nancy with his classmate Gaston Floquet, a future mathematician, and they both took chemistry courses from Camille Forthomme whom they later encountered as a collaborator at the faculty of sciences. He had to give up entering the Polytechnique for health reasons and instead entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in the Science section in 1866 where Pierre Auguste Bertin directed him towards physics. In 1869, he was ranked first in the agr\u00e9gation in physical sciences competition. He frequented the Bertin-Mourot family and in 1872 married his daughter Marie Eug\u00e9nie H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\nFrom 1869 to 1871, he taught physics and chemistry in Angoul\u00eame at the high school. From 1871 to 1873, he taught in Bourges. He then obtained a position as a lecturer at the faculty of sciences of Nancy, where he taught electricity, magnetism, optics, and acoustics.\nAppointed professor in 1877, then dean of the Faculty of Sciences in 1890, he directed this faculty until 1905. He participated in the creation of the university of Nancy in 1902, alongside professors Paul-\u00c9mile Appell and Lucien Cu\u00e9not. Very attached to the principles of laicity and the dissemination of knowledge, he set up free public courses on new electricity developments, the relationship between electricity and light, and X-rays, including scientific demonstrations.\nIn 1904, he chaired the 8th congress of the French Society of Physics organized in Nancy, notably in the premises of the Institut d'\u00e9lectrotechnique Nancy (future ENSIEG) where he had collaborated with Arthur Moritz Schoenflies.\nA bridge in Nancy is named in his honor.\nReferences\n^ Birth certificate on the L\u00e9onore base\n^ Marriage certificate no. 643 on archives.paris.fr\n^ a b Fran\u00e7oise Birck, \u00c9tienne Bolmont.

    "Northern Irish Gaelic footballer and manager (1936\u20132024)\nHugh Joseph O'Neill (17 August 1936 \u2013 3 August 2024), known as Jody O'Neill, was a Gaelic footballer and manager from Northern Ireland. At club level he played with Coalisland Na Fianna and at inter-county level with the Tyrone senior football team.\nPlaying career\nO'Neill first played Gaelic football to a high standard as a student at St Patrick's Academy in Dungannon. He was part of the first team to have success for the school when the Corn na n\u00d3g title was claimed, while he also earned selection to the Ulster Colleges team. He later studied at the College of Technology in Belfast but declined an offer from Queen's University to line out with them in the Sigerson Cup. By that stage O'Neill had begun his club career with Coalisland Na Fianna. He won two Tyrone MFC medals in 1950 and 1952, before winning his sole Tyrone SFC medal in 1955.\nO'Neill first appeared on the inter-county scene with Tyrone as a member of the minor team in 1951. It was the first of four successive years with the under-18 team before later lining out with the junior team. O'Neill began his association with the senior team in 1952. He was just 19 when he captained Tyrone to their very first Ulster SFC title in 1956. O'Neill won a second successive provincial title in 1957, as well as claiming Dr McKenna Cup and Dr Lagan Cup successes. He retired from inter-county activity in 1968 after serving as player-manager for his last season with the team.\nO'Neill's inter-county performances earned his inclusion on the Ulster inter-provincial team on 10 occasions. His five Railway Cup wins came in 1960, 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1966.\nManagement career\nO'Neill first became involved in team management in the twilight of his inter-county playing career. He managed the Tyrone junior team to the All-Ireland JFC title in 1968. He also took charge of the Tyrone senior team for the first time that year. O'Neill's team claimed their first Ulster SFC since his own playing days in 1973. He also served as under-21 team manager at this time and secured back-to-back Ulster U21FC titles in 1972 and 1973. O'Neill stepped down from his position in 1975, before returning for a second stint as manager between 1977 and 1980. He later returned or a second spell as under-21 manager.\nO'Neill was also heavily involved in coaching and management at club level with Coalisland Na Fianna. He guided the club's minor team to Tyrone MFC titles in 1985, 1991 and 1995. O'Neill was appointed co-selector for Ireland's successful three-game test against Australia in the 1986 International Rules Series.\nDeath\nO'Neill died on 3 August 2024, at the age of 87.\nHonours\nPlayer\nSt Patrick's Academy\nCorn na n\u00d3g: 1952 (c)\nCoalisland Na Fianna\nTyrone Senior Football Championship: 1955\nTyrone Minor Football Championship: 1950, 1952\nTyrone\nUlster Senior Football Championship: 1956 (c), 1957\nDr McKenna Cup: 1957\nDr Lagan Cup: 1957, 1958\nUlster\nRailway Cup: 1960, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966\nManagement\nCoalisland Na Fianna\nTyrone Minor Football Championship: 1985, 1991, 1995\nTyrone\nUlster Senior Football Championship: 1973\nAll-Ireland Junior Football Championship: 1968\nUlster Junior Football Championship: 1968\nUlster Under-21 Football Championship: 1972, 1973\nReferences\n^ \"Joseph (Jody) O'Neill\".

In western Galicia, the 9th and 3rd Russian armies advanced to the Dunac and pushed back the 4th Austro-Hungarian army between Krakow and the northern slopes of the Beskids. A counterattack by retreating Austro-Hungarian troops in the northern section of the Vistula was repulsed by the Russians, and then came to a standstill. As a result of the inconclusive battles of the 9th German Army in the decisive Battle of Lodz, the battles for Krakow were interrupted by both sides after two weeks of fighting. At the end of November, the chief of the General Staff of Austria-Hungary, Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, hastily began to regroup for a new counteroffensive at Limanova-Lapanov to stop the Russian breakthrough in northern Hungary.\nBackground\nMain article: Battle of the San river (1914)\nIn October 1914, a series of battles took place, as a result of which the armies of the central powers were defeated, the Russians returned almost all the lands in Poland, seized part of the lands in eastern Prussia, besieged Przemysl again and wanted to launch an invasion of Silesia, for this they needed take Krakow. In October, the numerical advantage was on the side of the Austrians, but they were drained of blood, and two armies that had previously operated against the Germans returned to the disposal of the Russians. They now had almost triple the numerical superiority. The task of the Austrians was to gain time and wait for reserves, And after that, go on the offensive. To slow down the Russians, the central powers burned everything in the district, which led to deaths and displacement of civilians.\nFirts Stage of Battle\n16 November\nOn November 1 (14), the Russians organized a cavalry breakthrough near the city of Krzeszowice, Two days later the 4th army crossed the Pilica River and began to move towards the German border. General Voirsch tried to launch a counterattack against these troops, but achieved only minor success and was forced to retreat. \nThe 9th army advanced very quickly, the Austrians literally ran away from it and did not offer any organized resistance.\n17 November\nRussian troops put up serious resistance to the Russians, inflicting constant counterattacks and heavy losses, however, the Russians did the same, counterattacks were fought off and the Germans were forced to constantly retreat. On this day, the Austrians launched a counterattack. However, they ran into the Russian guard and fled. The Russians took 1,800 prisoners.\nThe Austrians hoped that the next day they would be able to stop the Russians, the directive stated: \nThe outcome of tomorrow's attacks (November 18) by all three armies is crucial for success in the war. There is no superior opponent in front of us. The enemy is tired, he has problems with ammunition and supplies. His staff is also downsized. Everyone should be aware that lost time cannot be returned. Adamant in the opinion of all superiors, their personal contribution to the battle should bring and increase success The Austrians received reserves, they decided to occupy the city of Skala at any cost.\n18 November\nThe central powers were preparing an offensive, and the enemy did not know about it, but the Germans were able to intercept Russian telegrams, which put Russia at a disadvantage.\nVoirsh's group launched a decisive offensive and achieved some success, they occupied several settlements. At the same time, the Austrian strikes were met with stubborn resistance, the maximum that the first army could pass was 400 meters, the German troops acted more successfully.\nHowever, the central powers could not develop success, the 3rd cavalry corps moved back a little, but its front was not broken through. The Russians lost 4,500 prisoners, 18 machine guns and 2 guns\nCentral Powers attacks on November 18 brought the Austrians little success, although the Russians returned some of the territories, by the end of the day there was nothing left of the numerical superiority of the Russians, now the central powers had the initiative.\nSecond stage of Battle\n19 November\nThe Germans were worried about the Russian threat, they were pulling more and more of their troops from the western front, which would later turn out to be a cancerous mistake. By November 22, it was planned to throw 12 divisions against Russians\nThe front of the 4th Russian army stabilized, the enemy's attacks on that day were repulsed and on November 20 it was planned to go on the offensive.\nEverything was worse for the 9th army, there was a massacre near the city of Yangrota, but the enemy was able to break through only in one place, the guard hurried here and returned the positions with a short counterattack, capturing 500 prisoners.\n20 November\nThe central Powers' offensive continued.

    "Moroccan footballer (born 2002)\nAkram Nakach (Arabic: \u0623\u0643\u0631\u0645 \u0646\u0642\u0627\u0634; born 7 April 2002) is a Moroccan professional footballer who plays as a left-back for AS FAR.\nClub career\nUnion de Touarga\nNakach joined the Mohammed VI Football Academy training center at a young age, where he also received his schooling.\nOn 1 September 2021, Nakach signed his first professional contract by joining Union de Touarga for three seasons. He played his first season in Botola 2 and was crowned vice-champion in his first season. On 2 September 2022, he played his first match in Botola Pro against DHJ, coming on in the 81st minute in place of Omar Namsaoui (defeat, 1\u20130). On 2 October, he received his first start in Botola Pro against MA T\u00e9touan (draw, 1-1). Five days later, on 7 October, he gave his team victory by scoring the only goal of the match against SCC Mohamm\u00e9dia thanks to an assist from \u00c9ric Mbangossoum (victory, 1\u20130). His club finished the 2022\u201323 season in eighth place in the championship standings.\nAS FAR\nOn July 5, 2024, Nakach joined AS FAR on a four-year contract.\nInternational career\nNakach first received a call-up to the Morocco U-17 team in 2018 from manager Jamal Sellami to participate in the UNAF Championship qualifying for the UNAF U-17 Tournament. Facing Algeria U-17 (victory, 5\u20132), Tunisia U-17 (victory, 1\u20130) and Libya U-17 (victory, 1\u20130), the Moroccans won the tournament thanks to three wins out of three matches. Against Tunisia, Nakach scored the only goal of the match. In April 2019, Nakach was officially selected to take part in the African Cup of Nations in Tanzania. The Moroccans were eliminated in the first round, finishing in fourth and last place in the standings of their group composed of Cameroon U17 (defeat, 2\u20131), Guinea U17 (defeat, 1\u20130) and Senegal U17 (draw, 1-1).\nOn 9 June 2023, Nakach was on Issame Chara\u00ef's final list to take part in the U23 African Cup which took place in Morocco. He made his first minutes in two friendly preparation matches against Mauritania (victory, 4\u20131) and Zambia (victory, 4\u20132), on 15 and 19 June respectively. The group stage matches took place at the end of June against Guinea, Ghana and Congo at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat. On the bench for the opening match against Guinea (victory, 2\u20131), Nakach was absent from the match sheet during the second match against Ghana in place of Oussama El Azzouzi. Morocco thus validated its ticket for the semi-finals of the competition after a victory of 5\u20131. In the semi-final against Mali, he was absent from the match sheet, while the Moroccans managed to win the match on penalties after a draw of 2-2. The Moroccans then automatically qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris and the final of the CAN against Egypt. The final was won by Morocco in extra time against Egypt thanks to a goal by Oussama Targhalline (victory, 2\u20131).\nSelected in September 2023, Nakach entered the game in a friendly match on 7 September against Brazil in Fez (victory, 1\u20130). A second friendly match scheduled for 11 September in the same city was canceled by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation following the earthquake in Morocco.\nOn 4 July 2024, Nakach was selected by Tarik Sektioui in a list of 22 players with Morocco to take part in the 2024 Olympic Games.\nHonours\nMorocco U23\nU-23 Africa Cup of Nations: 2023\nSummer Olympics Bronze Medal: 2024\nMorocco U17\nUNAF U-17 Tournament: 2018\nReferences\n^ Presse (MAP), Agence Maghreb Arabe (16 May 2022). \"Botola: l'Union Touarga promu en premi\u00e8re division\u00a0!\".

They believed that the Shah's regime changed the phase of the struggle with the demonstrations of 15 Khordad 42. According to Mohammad Hanifnejad, \"the killing of people who were empty-handed showed that I can no longer continue fighting with the old methods.\" In addition to the struggle, they studied Islam and Western schools and the struggles of the people of Iran and the rest of the world, and reached armed struggle and founded the organization.\nHanifnejad and the early members of the People's Mojahedin Khalq Organization have done a lot of work in examining new answers to old and new issues from the heart of Islam, and in this way achieving a new and coherent reading of Islam and compiling and presenting it. They were trying To find a way to fight with the new era from the heart of Shia history. Together with Saeed Mohsen and Ali Asghar Badiazadegan, he learned the first lessons of Islam that is compatible with the new era and responsive to new issues from Engineer Bazargan, Ayatollah Taleghani and Dr. Sahabi.\nD\u0435\u0430th\nIn September 1971, he was arrested by Iran's SAVAK organization and sentenced to death for the crime of acting against the country's security.

    "\nTeungku Ishak Daud (12 January 1960 - 8 September 2004) is the Commander of GAM in the Peureulak region. He was once imprisoned by the Indonesian government, but was released again during the reign of president Abdurrahman Wahid on 21 May 2000. Subsequently, he rejoined GAM, and died in an ambush by the TNI, in 2004.\nBiography\nIshak was born in Blang Glumpang Kuala Idie Village, Idie Rayeuk District, East Aceh on January 12, 1960. He is the first child of Muhammad Daud bin Tengku Basyah and Nuriah. As a child, Isaac lived in a village where the average life was below the poverty line. His father worked as a fisherman, while his mother sold cakes. Ishak Daud felt that he was never satisfied with this condition.\nIn early 1984, when he was 24 years old, Ishak decided to migrate to Malaysia. In the neighboring country, Isaac Daud worked odd jobs, as a construction worker or restaurant keeper. Because he couldn't stand living like that in Malaysia, Ishak Daud decided to migrate to Singapore. Moreover, there are many Aceh people in that country. Just like in Malaysia, Ishak Daud also works odd jobs, from construction worker to transport driver. It was also in Singapore that Ishak Daud became aware of the Free Aceh Movement, especially at that time many Free Aceh activists held political meetings. Practically, while working in Singapore Ishak often attended these meetings. This also opened his insight into the history of Aceh.\nIn June 1987, Ishak was finally sworn in by Tengku Abdullah Musa as a member of GAM. Moreover, Hasan Tiro, who controls GAM from Sweden, needs Acehnese youth to be trained in military education and sent to Libya. Ishak Daud was part of a group of 40 Acehnese youth who were sent to Libya. After returning from Libya, he stopped in Singapore for 12 days.\nIshak Daud decided to return to Aceh via the Port of Tanjung Balai. From there he took a bus and returned to his hometown of Idi Rayeuk. Initially he worked as a fish trader and secretly recruited young people to become involved in GAM. Ishak was one of the first figures to raise the Aceh Merdeka flag at Idi Rayeuk High School, East Aceh on December 4, 1989, after Hasan Tiro raised the flag on Mount Halimun, Pidie on December 4, 1976.\nDied\nOn May 20, 1990, Ishak Daud attacked an ABRI post in Buloh Blang Ara, North Aceh. In the attack, two soldiers and a junior high school student died. Ishak Daud's group also succeeded in taking 22 M-16 weapons and Minimi weapons. For his actions, Ishak Daud was sentenced to 20 years in prison by the Lhokseumawe District Court. The trial was held in Sabang because in several previous trials, Ishak Daud was always hailed by his sympathizers. At that time, Ishak was said to be the Head of the Free Aceh Information Bureau. However, Ishak Daud only served two years, because during the leadership of President Abdurrahman Wahid, on May 21, 2000, Ishak Daud was released. Ishak decided to re-join GAM, his final position being GAM Commander in the Peureulak-Teumieng Region. Ishak died in an ambush by the TNI at the end of 2004.\nReferences\n^ News Liputan 6: Ishak Daud tewas, diakses 21 Feb 2015\n^ Penapost: Pejuang GAM paling ditakuti, diakses 21 Feb 2015\n^ News Detik: Tembak mati Ishak Daud, 14 anggota TNI naik pangkat, diakses 21 Feb 2015\n^ http://penapost.com/2014/05/7-pejuang-gam-paling-ditakuti.html\n",
    "\nPatricia A. McInerney is a retired American judge who served for over 20 years in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania's First Judicial District. She served for 7 years in its Commerce Case Management Program, a specialized business court docket, including three years as its supervising judge. She handled a number of high-profile cases, such as a dispute over control of Philadelphia's major newspaper and the distribution of over $125 million from a tobacco settlement.\nJudicial service\nMcInerney was a trial judge on the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas from 1996 until her retirement in 2018. After joining the court in 1996, she was successful in ten-year retention elections in 2005 and 2015. She originally served in the court's criminal division, and later in the general civil division.\nIn 2011, she was assigned by administrative judge John W. Herron to the Commerce Case Management Program (Commerce Court) to replace the late Albert W. Sheppard Jr. The Commerce Court is a business court docket within the Court of Common Pleas civil trial division, with a specialized jurisdiction primarily focused on business and commercial disputes. McInerney became one of three specialist judges assigned to this program, eventually being appointed its supervising judge in February 2016, a position she held until her 2018 retirement.  She had earlier served for a short period in Commerce Court in 2001, making her the first woman to serve as a judge in the Commerce Court.\nAmong her most notable cases, McInerney ruled that Pennsylvania was due $125 million more than arbitrators had allowed from a tobacco master settlement agreement, a decision that was upheld on appeal in 2014.\nMcInerney was the judge in the bitter dispute among the ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer. The battle was primarily between Lewis Katz and Gerry Lenfest on the one hand, and George Norcross, seeking control over Philadelphia's major daily newspaper. Among her rulings, McInerney rejected a request that she defer from resolving the dispute in Philadelphia's courts in favor of adjudication in the Delaware Court of Chancery; and she reversed the firing of the Inquirer's editor, Bill Marimow, which was the specific issue in the litigation.\nThere are approximately 100 of her Commerce Court opinions and orders posted on the Court of Common Pleas judicial opinion webpages.\nLegal practice\nMcInerney was admitted to the practice of law in Pennsylvania in 1981. She was an attorney at the Defender Association of Philadelphia from 1981 to 1987, after which she went into private legal practice. Since retiring as a judge in 2018, she provides services as an arbitrator, mediator, and referee/special master with the private alternative dispute resolution provider JAMS.\nEducation\nMcInerney received a Bachelor of Arts, with honors, and Masters of Arts from Colgate University. She received her Juris Doctor degree from Temple University School of Law (now Temple University James E. Beasley School of Law) in 1981.\nFrom 1999 to 2017, McInerney was an adjunct professor in trial advocacy at Temple University Beasley School of Law.\nAwards, honors, and positions\nMcInerney has received the following honors or held the following positions, among others;\nDistinguished Leaders Award from The Legal Intelligencer (2017)\nInaugural portrait, Philadelphia LGBTQ Bar Association's Judicial Portrait Project (2023)\nBusiness Court Representative, American Bar Association Business Law Section (2013-2015)\nPresident, Temple American Inn of Court (2018-2019)\nMember, Board of Advisors, Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts (2021-2023)\nMember, Pennsylvania state trial judge ethics committee\nMember, American College of Business Court Judges\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Judge Patricia A.

    "\nSecularism in Kosovo has a complex history and is influenced by political and social developments in the country. Since the declaration of independence in 2008, Kosovo has followed a clear course towards the separation of religion from the state, promoting freedom of belief and human rights.\nThe Constitution provides that secularism is a key element in building a democratic and just society, ensuring that all religious communities and individuals have the right to freely exercise their faith, while the state remains neutral and separate from religious matters.\nHistory\nYugoslav period\nDuring the period of Yugoslavia, especially under the Constitution of 1974, Kosovo had an autonomous status within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Yugoslavia's constitution provided for the separation of religion and state and guaranteed religious freedom, but the state remained largely secular. Religion had a limited role in public life, and religious institutions were separated from state affairs.\nAfter the Kosovo War and Independence\nAfter the Kosovo war in 1999 and NATO intervention, Kosovo went into a period of international administration under UNMIK. During this time, the foundations were laid for building democratic institutions and respecting human rights, including religious freedom.\nUpon declaring independence in 2008, Kosovo adopted a constitution that reflected these principles. The Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo guarantees the separation of religion from the state and promotes a secular state where all religions are treated equally.\nLegal framework\nConstitution of Kosovo\nArticle 8 of the Constitution of Kosovo defines the state as secular and guarantees the separation of religion from the state. Article 38 guarantees freedom of belief, conscience and religion, giving citizens the right to practice their faith freely and without interference.\nAdditional Legislation\nLaws in Kosovo support these constitutional principles by ensuring that every individual has the right to religious freedom and not to be discriminated against on the basis of religious belief. Religious communities have the right to register and operate in accordance with the laws of the country, managing their assets and institutions.\nSecularism in Practice\nIn practice, Kosovo has a religiously diverse population where the majority are Muslim, but there are also Christian and other religious communities. Secularism in Kosovo means that the government does not interfere in religious matters and maintains a neutral approach to all faiths. This is evident in public education, where religious instruction is not part of state school curricula, and in the way holidays and religious symbolism are treated in state institutions.\nChallenges and controversies\nHowever, the clear separation of religion and state has also encountered challenges and contestations, especially in contexts where religious beliefs clash with secular practices and laws. Some such cases include issues of women's rights, the rights of the LGBTQ+ community and the use of headscarves in public places.\nSee also\nConstitution of Kosovo\nSecularism in Albania\nIrreligion in Albania\nSeparation of church and state\nSecularism in Turkey\nReferences\n^ a b c \"KUSHTETUTA E REPUBLIK\u00cbS S\u00cb KOSOV\u00cbS\". gzk.rks-gov.net (in Albanian).

    "Ancient Greek physician\nAsclepiades (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c0\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2) Titiensis or Citiensis was a physician of Ancient Greece who must have lived in or before the second century CE, as he is quoted by the Greco-Roman medical writer Caelius Aurelianus at that time. Caelius describes him as an authority regarding his pre-eminence in identifying apoplexy with paralysis.\nWhile this name is rendered \"Titiensis\" in many of the early editions of Caelius's work, it has been suggested his name was originally \"Citiensis\", and that \"Titiensis\" was an error introduced by an earlier copyist. Later editions are split whether to call him \"Titiensis\" or \"Citiensis\".\nSome scholars such as Daniel Le Clerc were doubtful this Asclepiades was distinct from all of the other obscure ancient physicians who shared this name. He may be the same person as Apollonios of Kition.\nReferences\n^ Caelius Aurelianus, De morbis acutis et chronicis 3.5, p. 201\n^ a b c Irby-Massie, Georgia L.; Keyser, Paul T., eds.

It is a terpenoid and acetal that functions as a pheromone in bark beetles and elephants.\nOccurrence\nAsian elephant in Laos\nFrontalin acts as an insect pheromone in bark beetles of the genus Dendroctonus, including Dendroctonus frontalis (Southern Pine Beetle) and Dendroctonus brevicomis (Western Pine Beetle), as well as the Mountain Pine Beetle. The biologically active form is predominantly (-)-frontalin. However, (+)-frontalin also occurs in some cases. In Dendroctonus frontalis, the female mainly produces (-)-frontalin, the male mainly (+)-frontalin. In Dendroctonus rufipennis the distribution is reversed.\nIn addition to its role in insect pheromones, frontalin also serves as a pheromone in Asian elephants. It is secreted by adult male elephants during musth, with secretion levels increasing with age. It signals mating readiness, particularly attracting females who are also in the receptive phase of their sexual cycle.\nBiosynthesis\nUnlike many pheromones in bark beetles, which are derived from terpenes present in host plants, frontalin does not follow this pathway. The biosynthesis in Dendroctonus jeffreyi and other species of the genus was studied using isotope labeling. The biosynthesis is believed to originate from acetate, with geranyl pyrophosphate and 6-methyl-6-hepten-2-one being probable intermediates.\nSynthesis\nBoth enantiomers of frontalin can be synthesized starting from the ester of 8-phenylmenthol with pyruvic acid. The alcohol component acts as a chiral auxiliary. In the presence of lithium perchlorate, methylmagnesium bromide can be added to the reactant. The resulting hydroxy group can then be reacted with the Cornforth reagent (pyridinium dichromate), followed by the addition of a Grignard compound derived from 5-bromo-2-methylpent-1-ene. Reduction with lithium aluminum hydride removes the chiral auxiliary, yielding a diol. Subsequent reaction with ozone and reductive work-up with dimethyl sulfide produces (-)-frontalin. By reversing the order of the Grignard reagents, i.e., adding methylmagnesium bromide second, (+)-frontalin can be obtained.\nAn alternative synthetic route begins with a Diels-Alder reaction between 3-buten-2-one and methacrylic acid methyl ester. The methyl ester can be reduced to a hydroxymethyl group using lithium aluminum hydride. Oxymercuration with mercury(II) acetate, followed by treatment with potassium hydroxide/ sodium borohydride, hydroxylates the double bond and allows for direct cyclization to frontalin.\nReferences\n^ a b James K.

    "\nDominican soldier (1824\u20131913)\nRas\u00edn Isur\u00fan (1824 \u2013 1913) was a Dominican revolutionary and military commander. He was a hero of two independence wars of the Dominican Republic. \nEarly life\nHe was born in 1824 in the city of Puerto Plata. He was the son of a Dutch emigrant and a native  Dominican. Not much is known about his childhood or adulthood, but it is acknowledged that he was a soldier in the Dominican War of Independence.\nDominican Restoration War\nWhen the Dominican Restoration War erupted and the patriots started fighting in Puerto Plata, on August 27, 1863, Isur\u00fan, who was already recognized as a man of action, returned to arms and marched into combat. At first the city was under the control of the restorers, who forced the occupants to lock themselves in and remain besieged in the San Felipe Fortress. However, and as reports of the fighting that began on the Line in mid-month, had reached the respective captain generals of Cuba and Puerto Rico, since the two Caribbean islands under the control of Spain, had been dispatched with important reinforcements, which began to disembark in Puerto Plata on the night of August 27, 1863. Those troops reinforced the besieged, and a war broke out in fierce battle for control of the city, which was the scene of indescribable cruelties and horrors, of murders and the pillage committed by the invaders. Given the ostensible numerical and material superiority of the invading Spanish army, the patriots were forced to retreat to the fields to continue the resistance.\nThe Spanish maintained control of the ruined city, and from there, under the command of the Spanish general Mariano Cappa and Juan Suero, they started the march towards Santiago, in aid of those who were under siege in that city. Isur\u00fan, together with commanders Pedro Gregorio Mart\u00ednez and Juan Bonilla, settled in the J\u00e1cuba camp, on the road from Puerto Plata to Santiago, through Palo Quemado. These forces caused heavy casualties to the columns of the invaders, part of which they had to retreat in their first attempt to make their way to Santiago. When the fronts were stabilized in Puerto Plata, Isur\u00fan was appointed Plaza Assistant from the active camp of Maluis, in which almost every one fought days. During the war, Ras\u00edn Isur\u00fan had different bosses, among which included generals Carlos Medrano, Juan Noues\u00ed and General Gaspar Polanco himself, who was the Chief Operations Superior throughout that line.\nIsur\u00fan, a soldier in two patriotic wars, acquired the rank of general by the end of the Dominican Restoration War.\nDeath\nAccording to his biographer, Rufino Mart\u00ednez, Isur\u00fan died in 1913, at the age of 89.\nHistoriography\nMart\u00ednez also comments on the modifications suffered by the original surname of this character. Thus, Iseroen or Iserven was lost as it suffered alterations in people's speech and use. Iseru\u00e9n, first; Isur\u00fan later. Ultimately it has remained in Sur\u00fan, which is how the descendants of the ancient warrior use it and how it has spread throughout the areas of Puerto Plata and other regions of the country.\nSee also\nCarlos Medrano\nFrancisco Reyes Mari\u00f3n\nPedro Gregorio Mart\u00ednez\nJuan Noues\u00ed\nReferences\n^ Mej\u00eda, Rafael Chaljub (2007).

    "American rock band\nHoly Roman Empire was an American rock band formed in Chicago in late 2003. It was founded by musicians from the late-1990's hardcore scene: guitarists Neeraj Kane and Jay Jancetic, and bassist Geoff Reu, with drummer Tony Tintari of Shai Hulud joining the group a few months later. Classically trained singer Emily Schambra joined about a year later, which was followed by the recording of a demo and them beginning to play live shows.\nThey released their first EP Lost in Landscapes in 2005. Punknews.org's Aubin Paul described it as \"pleasant and unassuming but relatively forgettable\". AllMusic reviewer Stewart Mason shared this sentiment, calling it \"competently executed post-hardcore\" and \"strictly for serious fans interested in Holy Roman Empire's growing pains\". It was followed by their debut album The Longue Dur\u00e9e in 2007, produced by Matt Allison. AllMusic praised the vocals and the production, and said that it is \"tuneful without being blatantly commercial, thoughtful without being ickily emo, and a generally rocking good listen\". Brian Shultz of Punknews.org stated \"it's as solid a debut full-length can usually be produced; its style is a pleasant surprise considering its members' preceding projects; and it could be a great breakout release for Hewhocorrupts, Inc\". Alternative Press magazine rated it 4/5.

    "Prehistoric site in Suffolk, England\nFreston is a Neolithic causewayed enclosure, an archaeological site near the village of Freston, in Suffolk, England. Causewayed enclosures were built in England from shortly before 3700\u00a0BC until at least 3500\u00a0BC; they are characterized by the full or partial enclosure of an area with ditches that are interrupted by gaps, or causeways. Their purpose is not known; they may have been settlements, meeting places, or ritual sites.\nThe Freston enclosure was first identified from aerial photographs in 1969, and was excavated in 2019.\nBackground\nFreston is a causewayed enclosure, a form of earthwork that was built in northwestern Europe, including the southern British Isles, in the early Neolithic period.  Causewayed enclosures are areas that are fully or partially enclosed by ditches interrupted by gaps, or causeways, of unexcavated ground, often with earthworks and palisades in some combination.  The function of causewayed enclosures is debated.  The causeways are difficult to explain in military terms since they would have provided multiple ways for attackers to pass through the ditches to the inside of the enclosure, though it was suggested they could have been sally ports for defenders to emerge from and attack a besieging force.  Evidence of attacks at some sites provided support for the idea that the enclosures were fortified settlements. They may have been seasonal meeting places, used for trading cattle or other goods such as pottery.\nThere is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains was deliberately deposited in the ditches.  The construction of these enclosures would have required substantial labour for clearing the land, preparing trees for use as posts or palisades, and digging the ditches, and would probably have been planned for some time in advance, as they were built in a single operation.\nOver seventy causewayed enclosures have been identified in the British Isles, and they are one of the most common types of an early Neolithic site in Western Europe.  About a thousand are known in all.  They began to appear at different times in different parts of Europe: dates range from before 4000\u00a0BC in northern France, to shortly before 3000\u00a0BC in northern Germany, Denmark, and Poland. The enclosures began to appear in southern Britain shortly before 3700\u00a0BC, and continued to be built for at least 200 years; in a few cases, they continued to be used as late as 3300 to 3200\u00a0BC.\nSite\nMap of the causewayed enclosure, showing the road passing through it, the location of the trench, and the possible Neolithic longhouse in the northeast corner\nThe Freston enclosure is in Suffolk, near the village of Freston, south of Ipswich. It lies 31\u00a0m (102\u00a0ft) above sea level on the Shotley peninsula in southeast East Anglia, between the estuaries of the Orwell and Stour rivers.  It was identified from aerial photographs taken in 1969 and 1972.  The ditch circuits, as revealed by cropmarks, consist of two concentric circles, with numerous gaps in the ditches.  Cropmarks also show faint traces of a line between the ditches which may indicate where a palisade once stood, though this is only clear in the north and northeastern parts of the circuit.  The remains of a rectangular structure, 37 by 9 metres (121 by 30\u00a0ft), can be detected within the enclosure in the northeastern corner.  The structure has not been dated, but if it were found to be Neolithic it would be the first causewayed enclosures in the UK with a Neolithic structures inside its circuit, though examples are known from the continent.  The B1080 road passes through the site from south to northeast.  Farm buildings (part of Potash Farm) along the southwest part of the circuit date from the 17th century, and in the 19th century two cottages (known as Latimer Cottages) were built to the south-east of the centre of the enclosure.\nThe enclosure is 8.55\u00a0ha (21.1 acres), which makes it one of the largest causewayed enclosures known.  The site has no features that are visible above ground; all banks and ditches have been levelled by ploughing for many years.\nNeolithic practices began to reach Britain in about 4050 BC, spreading across the channel, and reaching south-eastern England, including Suffolk, early in the process.  Freston is about 13\u00a0km (8\u00a0mi) from the sea; it would have been about 18\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) from the sea at the start of the Neolithic.  The location between two river valleys would have made it more easily accessible to the seafaring groups that crossed from the continent, and a spring within the enclosure would have made the site attractive, for practical reasons, and perhaps also for the ritual or symbolic significance of springs.\nArchaeological investigations\nDiscovery, fieldwalking, and watching briefs\nAerial photographs taken by the RAF in 1944 showed no sign of cropmarks, and the site was not discovered until 1969. That year J. K. St Joseph, who ran the  C",

    "American author and anti-suffragist (1869\u20131926)\nGrace Duffield Goodwin (October 2, 1869 \u2013 January 8, 1926) was an American anti-suffrage activist, writer, and poet. \nServed as president of the District of Columbia Anti-Suffrage Association and holding a position on the executive committee of the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage. Her contributions to the movement included public speaking, writing influential articles, and engaging in debates. Goodwin also authored the treatise Anti-Suffrage: Ten Good Reasons in 1914, in which she argued against women's suffrage, advocating for traditional gender roles and the idea that women were better suited to the domestic sphere.\nAlongside her activism, Goodwin was a prolific writer, contributing to various newspapers, magazines, and literary publications. Her literary works included poetry and essays that explored themes of suburban life, nature, and societal roles.\nEarly life and education\nGrace Duffield was born on October 2, 1869, in Adrian, Michigan, to Reverend Samuel Willoughby Duffield and Harriet Hayward Duffield. She attended Bishopthorpe Seminary in South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and later pursued additional courses at Pembroke College, the women's college affiliated with Brown University.\nAnti-Suffrage advocacy\nGrace Duffield Goodwin played a significant role in the anti-suffrage movement by actively participating in and supporting anti-suffrage campaigns. She served as the president of the District of Columbia Anti-Suffrage Association and was a member of the executive committee of the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage.\nIn 1912, she was the chairman of the District of Columbia Auxiliary of the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage.\nGoodwin participated in a notable suffrage debate against Carrie Chapman Catt during the City Club's fifth season in 1913\u201314. This debate was a significant event, attracting a large audience and contributing to the club's prominence in political and social discourse.\nShe was featured as a speaker at various anti-suffrage events, including mass meetings in Utica and Gloversville, where she worked alongside other prominent anti-suffragists like Alice Hay Wadsworth. Goodwin's involvement included public speaking and participating in organized efforts to sway public opinion against women's enfranchisement. Her efforts extended to responding to the shifting political climate during World War I, particularly the framing of suffrage as a \"war measure,\" which she and her fellow anti-suffragists opposed.\nGoodwin's article, \"The 'Feminist' Woman \u2014 A Thorough Radical Who Repudiates All Restraint,\" published in The New York Times on November 9, 1913, Goodwin critiqued the use of the term \"feminist\" in contemporary discourse. She argued that \"feminist\" had come to signify the most radical and revolutionary women who rejected traditional customs, social norms, and moral limitations. Goodwin distinguished between feminists and suffragists, suggesting that while all feminists are suffragists, not all suffragists are feminists. She criticized the feminist movement as overly radical and dangerous, asserting that it aimed to liberate women from all forms of restraint, extending beyond just the suffrage movement.\nGoodwin argued that feminists were mentally defective, comparing their intellectual capabilities to that of an eleven-year-old. She suggested that adopting feminist ideals would increase women's risk of psychiatric disorders by 25%, based on the assumption that public life would exacerbate their supposed mental and emotional vulnerabilities.\nGoodwin, along with other anti-suffrage activists, utilized medical language to reinforce their arguments. They claimed that women's so-called \"temperamental disabilities,\" lack of \"endurance in things mental,\" and insufficient \"nervous stability\" would lead to debilitation if they engaged in public life. This rhetoric was used to argue that women required special care and education, as opposed to participating equally in society. This view was rooted in the belief that women's supposed disabilities justified their exclusion from public life, and that only medical experts could properly address these issues.\nAnti-Suffrage: Ten Good Reasons (1915)\nIn 1914, she contended that government stability relied on physical enforcement, which women were not involved in, and claimed that suffrage was a matter of policy, not a fundamental right. Goodwin believed that the push for women's suffrage came from a minority and would only worsen political corruption. She argued that women had advanced significantly without the vote and were more effective as political outsiders. Her views were grounded in a belief that suffrage would disrupt natural gender roles, fail to improve public morals, and diminish women's existing privileges.\nGoodwin argued that women's natural role in the home and motherhood justified their exclusion from politics. She asserted that engaging in political activit",
    "\nBougainville playwright, journalist and politician (1941 - 2018)\nLeo Hannett (17 July 1941 \u2013 18 June 2018) was a Bougainvillean and Black Power activist, playwright, journalist and politician who played a significant role in Papua New Guinea's anti-colonial struggle and movements for the autonomy and independence of Bougainville. He was regarded as Bougainville's \"most important secessionist leader of the 1970s.\"\nEarly life\nHannett was born on 17 July 1941 in Nissan Island within the Australian-administered Territory of New Guinea, shortly before the Japanese occupation of New Guinea. Evacuated to the Solomon Islands during World War Two, he returned with his father and two brothers, his mother having died while in the Solomons.\nPolitics\nHannett was one of a group of Bougainvillean students living in the territorial capital of Port Moresby who in 1968 called for a referendum to be held on Bougainville's future. He served as the group's spokesman and issued a statement requesting a vote by 1970 \"to decide whether Bougainville should be independent, should unite with the Solomon Islands to constitute a separate unit, or should remain with PNG\".\nIn 1969, the Australia Party sponsored Hannett to undertake a four-state speaking tour in Australia, at the invitation of party leader Reg Turnbull. Interviewed by The Sydney Morning Herald he declared himself committed to non-violence and cited his influences as James Baldwin, Tom Mboya, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld and Mahatma Gandhi.\nIn 1973, PNG chief minister Michael Somare asked Hannett to chair the Bougainville Special Political Committee. The committee comprised 36 local leaders and was tasked with gauging public opinion on Bougainville's political future, with a report to be delivered to the Constitutional Planning Committee chaired by John Momis. Hannett made clandestine visits to Honiara around the same time, exploring the possibility of Bougainville's union with the Solomon Islands.\nIn September 1975, following dissatisfaction with proposals for PNG's new constitution related to the distribution of profits from the Panguna mine, Hannett joined with others in Bougainville in proclaiming the unilateral declaration of independence of the Republic of the North Solomons.\nIn 2006, Hannett was elected to the national parliament in a by-election for the provincial seat of Bougainville. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Chair of the Public Accounts Committee. As the sitting member, he unsuccessfully sought re-election at the 2007 general election, coming second with 23.04% of the vote.\nBetween 2010 and 2015, Hannett served in two ministries in the Autonomous Bougainville Government: Minister of Police and Minister for Public Services.\nFollowing his death, the National Parliament observed a moment of silence in respect on 17 July 2018.\nReferences\nFootnotes\n^ Wesley-Smith 1992, p.\u00a0414.\n^ Post Courier 2018.\n^ a b Pritchard 1969.\n^ Regan, Anthony J.

    "Boxing match\nTony Tubbs vs. Tim Witherspoon, billed as King's Dream was a professional boxing match contested on July 19, 1986, for the WBA heavyweight title.\nBackground\nUndefeated Tony Tubbs had captured the WBA heavyweight title in his previous fight, defeating reigning champion Greg Page in what was Page's first defense on April 29, 1985. For his first defense, Tubbs was now obligated to face the WBA's #1 ranked heavyweight Tim Witherspoon, who had become the mandatory challenger after defeating James \"Bonecrusher\" Smith on June 15 that same year. The fight was delayed for several months as the bout's promoter Don King faced legal charges for tax evasion and conspiracy, causing him to temporarily reduce the number of fights he promoted. When King was acquitted of all charges in November, the fight was officially announced the following month to take place on January 17, 1986. King also announced that the bout would celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., which was January 15; two days before the fight and take place in King's native Atlanta at the Omni Coliseum.\nThough it was not officially a part of it, the Tubbs\u2013Witherspoon fight was a precursor to the heavyweight unification series, which aimed to crown a new undisputed champion, that King had announced plans for only 10 days prior. The unification series was officially announced at press conference held on the day of the fight, with the winner of the Tubbs\u2013Witherspoon fight automatically joining the series.\nThe fight\nWitherspoon was the aggressor of the fight, pressing the action while Tubbs, weighing 244 pounds, 15 pounds heavier then he was when he won the title in his previous fight, fought at a much reserved pace. Though there were no knockdowns in the fight's 15 rounds, Witherspoon had little trouble landing punches as Tubbs took a more defensive approach, backing up and not forcing anything offensively. Despite Witherspoon's relative dominance, the three scorecards were extremely close. One judge scored the bout a draw at 143\u2013143 (each fighter winning seven rounds apiece with one round even) while the other two scored the fight narrowly in favor of Witherspoon with scores of 144\u2013143 (seven rounds to six with two even) and 144\u2013141 (nine rounds to six).\nAftermath\nSaid Witherspoon about Tubbs after the fight \"He didn't do nothing. He didn't really fight like a champion. I had to chase him down.\" Tubbs himself offered no excuses stating \"There ain't no excuses in the game of boxing. Either you win or you lose. And I take my losses like I take my wins.\"\nShortly after his victory, Witherspoon ran into trouble after a post-fight drug test revealed traces of marijuana in his system. Facing a possible suspension and being stripped of his title, Witherspoon admitted to smoking a single joint in November while celebrating with friends after signing the contract for the title shot against Tubbs and stated \"I would never know it would trace up so many months later.\" Witherspoon, his promoter Don King and manager Carl King were first summoned to go before the Georgia Boxing Commission to explain the positive test after which Witherspoon was issued a one-year probation and a $500 fine. Witherspoon would then face a disciplinary hearing with the WBA in March. Though Tubbs and his team insisted Witherspoon be stripped of the title, WBA president Gilberto Mendoza opted to keep Witherspoon as champion and instead to issued him a $25,000 fine and ordered a Witherspoon\u2013Tubbs rematch.\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For WBA heavyweight title\nBroadcasting\nReferences\n^ \"Tim Witherspoon vs. Tony Tubbs\". boxrec.com.

    "In this Chinese name, the family name is  Tong.\nTong Guowei (died 1719) was a Qing dynasty official. He was a maternal uncle of Kangxi Emperor.\nLife\nTong Guowei was the second (or the third) son of Tulai. According to the Comprehensive history of Eight Banners (\u6b3d\u5b9a\u516b\u65d7\u901a\u5fd7), The Tong (\u4f5f) family from Fushun was a sinicized Jurchen clan, they were incorporated into the Han Chinese Plain Blue Banner. However, Pamela Kyle Crossley stated that they were actually Han Chinese and falsely claimed to be related to the Manchu Tunggiya (\u4f5f\u4f73) clan of Jilin, using this false claim to get themselves transferred to a Manchu banner in the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. The Tong family was the most powerful family during the Kangxi period, thus got the nickname \"Tong Ban Chao\" (\u4f5f\u534a\u671d), which meant \"the Tong who fill up half the Court\".\nIn 1674, after the Revolt of the Three Feudatories had begun, Wu Yingxiong, the eldest son of Wu Sangui, plotted a riot in Beijing. Hearing of the plan, Tong Guowei quickly arrested the ringleaders with the aid of thirty guards. He was appointed the commander of the imperial bodyguard (\u9818\u4f8d\u885b\u5167\u5927\u81e3) and Deliberative Ministers in 1682. In 1689 he was granted the hereditary rank First class Duke (\u4e00\u7b49\u516c). He fought against Dzungars in the Battle of Ulan Butung, in which his brother Tong Guogang was killed in action. Tong Guowei was held responsible for not taking advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy during the battle, and was dismissed from his post as Deliberative Ministers. He accompanied Kangxi on both of the latter's expeditions against Galdan in 1696 and in 1697.\nTong Guowei died in 1719. He was given the posthumous name Duanchun (\u7aef\u7d14) and awarded posthumous appointment of Grand Tutor (\u592a\u5085) by Yongzheng Emperor in 1723.\nTong Guogang and Tong Guowei were said to believe in Christianity, though their political lives prohibited their formal conversions. They maintained close relationships with two Jesuit missionaries, Lodovico Buglio and Gabriel de Magalh\u00e3es.\nFamily\nFather: Tulai\nMother: Lady Gioro\nSiblings:\nElder sister: Empress Xiaokangzhang (mother of Kangxi Emperor)\nElder brother: Tong Guoji (\u4f5f\u570b\u7d00)?\nElder brother: Tong Guogang (\u4f5f\u570b\u7db1)\nWife: Lady He\u0161eri\nChildren:\nEldest son: Yekeshu (\u8449\u514b\u66f8), father of Sunggayan (\u821c\u5b89\u984f)\nSecond son: Dekesi (\u5fb7\u514b\u65b0)\nThird son: Longkodo\nFourth son: Hongshan (\u6d2a\u5584)\nFifth son: Qingyuan (\u6176\u5143)\nSixth son: Qingfu (\u6176\u5fa9)\nDaughter: Empress Xiaoyiren\nDaughter: Imperial Noble Consort Quehui\nReferences\n^ a b c \"\u6e05\u5185\u5927\u81e3\u4f5f\u56fd\u7eb2\u6392\u884c\u957f\u5b50\u5417\uff1f\". www.axjlzp.com.\n^ a b c d  Works related to \u6e05\u53f2\u7a3f/\u5377287 at Wikisource (Draft History of Qing Volume 287)\n^  Works related to \u6b3d\u5b9a\u516b\u65d7\u901a\u5fd7/\u5377135 at Wikisource (Comprehensive history of Eight Banners, Volume 135)\n^ a b Crossley, Pamela (June 1983). \"restricted access The Tong in Two Worlds: Cultural Identities in Liaodong and Nurgan during the 13th-17th centuries\".

    "American soccer player (born 2001)\nHeather Hinz (born June 27, 2001) is an American professional soccer player who plays as a goalkeeper for the Houston Dash of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She played collegiately for the South Carolina Gamecocks before being drafted by the Dash in the 2024 NWSL Draft.\nEarly life and college career\nHinz was born in Columbia, Maryland, to Laura and Lance Hinz. She has three older sisters, one of whom, Megan, played soccer as a goalkeeper at Michigan before turning professional and then becoming a college coach. Hinz started out as a striker before being asked to play in goal because of an injury to her Olympic Development Program team's keeper. She played high school soccer at Our Lady of Good Counsel and ECNL club soccer for Bethesda Union.\nSouth Carolina Gamecocks, 2019\u20132023\nFollowing one season as a backup, Hinz became the starting goalkeeper for the South Carolina Gamecocks during the abbreviated 2020 season. In the 2021 postseason, she had to make only three saves to upset North Carolina in the first round of the NCAA tournament and went on to record a career-high eleven saves in their quarterfinal loss to BYU. She led the country with 13 clean sheets in the 2022 season, part of the strong defense on a Gamecock team that ranked as high as third nationally. In that year's SEC championship, she saved three penalty kicks in a semifinal shootout against Georgia and made a last-minute save to keep her shutout against Alabama in the  title game, being named the tournament's most valuable player. She recorded ten shutouts in 2023, leading her conference in save percentage and goals against average, and was recognized as the SEC Goalkeeper of the Year and first-team All-SEC.\nClub career\nHinz was drafted 38th overall by the Houston Dash in the third round of 2024 NWSL Draft. She was signed to a one-year contract with a one-year option, becoming one of the backups for reigning Goalkeeper of the Year winner Jane Campbell. Hinz made her professional debut on July 28, 2024, in the group stage of the 2024 NWSL x Liga MX Femenil Summer Cup, and recorded six saves in a 3\u20130 win over Tigres UANL.\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Heather Hinz\".

    "\nThe State Archives in Slavonski Brod (Croatian: Dr\u017eavni arhiv u Slavonskom Brodu) is the primary public institution responsible for preservation of archival materials in the Brod-Posavina County and Po\u017eega-Slavonia County located in Slavonski Brod in eastern Croatia.\nHistory\nDue to the accumulation of documents at the city museum and the need for systematic collection and proper storage, an initiative to establish an archive in Slavonski Brod was launched in 1957. This was part of a broader plan to create a new network of archives in the People's Republic of Croatia. The Croatian Archival Council supported the initiative, leading to the establishment of the Historical Archive of Slavonski Brod on March 16, 1959, by the decision of the People's Committee of the Slavonski Brod district. After the independence of Croatia, the Ministry of Culture took over the role of founder of the archives on May 27, 1994. Following directives from the Ministry of Culture on January 21, 1993, the archive was renamed from the Historijski arhiv u Slavonskom Brodu to the Povijesni Arhiv u Slavonskom Brodu. The term \"Historijski\" was replaced with \"Povijesni,\" both of which translate to \"historical\" in English. While \"Povijesni\" is derived from exclusively Croatian lexicons, \"Historijski\" is a shared version throughout Serbo-Croatian language area. This change signified a broader trend of shift towards emphasizing national linguistic identity at the time. The archive was renamed once again in 1997 to its current name. In 2024 the archive organized a ceremony to mark 65 years of its work.\nSee also\nList of archives in Croatia\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nReferences\n^ \"Dr\u017eavni arhiv u Slavonskom Brodu\".

    "CSL-TV was the callsign of a television station operated by the American Forces Network in the Lajes Field in the Azores. The station was the first regular television station under the aegis of the AFRTS, being founded in 1954. It last operated in 2011, by then acting as a relayer of AFN Prime Atlantic.\nHistory\nUp until 1954, the US Armed Forces exclusively provided radio broadcasts. Plans to introduce a television station were proposed to Gen. Curtis E. LeMay to boost morale for servicemen in US Air Force bases.\nTo this end, AFRS was renamed AFRTS on April 21, 1954.:\u200a81\u200a CSL-TV became the first television station set up by them, and started broadcasting on October 17, 1954, after receiving a permit from the Portuguese Government.:\u200a81\u200a The station was the first television station of any kind in Portugal (two and a half years before RTP started regular broadcasts) and the Azores (nearly 21 years before the start of RTP A\u00e7ores). Until its launch, Portuguese people had never seen television before. In theory, it was the second AFN station overall (after the first experiment at Loring Air Base in December 1953), in practice, it was the first in a series of stations catering overseas bases. Lajes was selected as a \"proving ground\" for television broadcasts due to its relative isolation. The government dictated that television sets were limited to U.S. and Portuguese military personnel, as there was no Portuguese TV available locally in the area. Television receivers were heavily controlled and were registered like firearms. Equipment was provided by the DAGE company on the cheap, which was inadequate for broadcasting.\nThe station broadcast on VHF channel 8 using a low-power transmitter and an ERP of 30 watts (50 watts in some sources). Following the Limestone Air Base 20-watt experiment, it was determined that all AFRTS television stations would operate on low-powered transmitters. CSL's transmitter signal covered a radius of 3.5 miles from the transmitter to the shore line. The station broadcast seven hours a day on average.\nCSL-TV moved to new facilities in mid-1958 on a hilltop overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and the base. The station also started using kinescopes while other stations in the AFRTS circuit were starting to air videotaped content.\nAs of 1964, the station was operating daily from 6pm to midnight. It also produced a live evening newscast with pictures sourced from newspapers and magazines rather than film. At the time, it was one of the seven stations in the USAFE tri-continental network. Programming was received in tapes from the United States until the entrance of the station to the AFRTS SATNET system. The station had two newscasts, a half-hour bulletin at 6pm with news coming from the United States, as well as sports and a local weather forecast; but news about the Azores and Portugal were few to none. One of the few cases where CSL-TV did cover a local event was during an earthquake that almost destroyed the island in 1980. CSL-TV joined the SATNET system in November 1983, enabling live coverage.:\u200a112\u200a\nThe station used to have a tremendous influence on the local Portuguese population in Praia da Vit\u00f3ria, alongside other imported goods that were available there first before the rest of the country.\nOver-the-air broadcasts ended in 2011 due to its old age and inconvenient location; the building was torn down in November. 2015 was marked by the reduction of the contingent of American military staff working at the base.\nCurrently the base is served by an internal closed-circuit cable system limited to personnel, carrying the eight AFN channels, a radio station and a community channel.\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Lajes more than speck in television history\".

    "2016 song cycle by Wolfgang Rihm\nReminiszenz is a song cycle for tenor and large orchestra by Wolfgang Rihm composed in 2016 for the opening of the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg. It is subtitled Triptychon und Spruch in memoriam Hans Henny Jahnn, setting poems by Hans Henny Jahnn, Peter Huchel and Walter Muschg. It was premiered on 11 January 2017.\nHistory\nWolfgang Rihm received a commission from the NDR broadcaster to compose a work for the opening concert\u00a0 of the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg. It was the only world premiere for this occasion.\nHe created a song cycle for tenor and large orchestra in 2016, based on four poems by Hans Henny Jahnn, a playwright, author and organ builder from Hamburg, Peter Huchel, a German poet, and Walter Muschg\u00a0, a Swiss author. It is subtitled Triptychon und Spruch in memoriam Hans Henny Jahnn, in memory of Jahnn. The duration is given as 15 minutes.\nThe song cycle premiered at the Elbphilharmonie on 11 January 201, performed by tenor Pavol Breslik\u00a0 and the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra conducted by Thomas Hengelbrock. A reviewer from The Guardian noted that the texts were bleak and the music \"characteristically eclectic\". A reviewer from the New York Times described the music as \"rangy, difficult\", \"broody\" and \"arresting\".\nReferences\n^ Brown 2024.\n^ Elbphilharmonie 2017.\n^ a b c d Schott 2017.\n^ Engel 2017.\n^ a b Kettle 2017.\n^ a b Universal Edition 2024.\n^ Spiegel 2017.\n^ a b Fonseca-Wollheim 2017.\nCited sources\nBrown, Jeffrey Arlo (29 July 2024). \"Wolfgang Rihm, Prolific Contemporary Classical Music Composer, Dies at 72\".

    "Lifeboat station in Scotland\nOban Lifeboat Station is located at the harbour town of Oban, on the Firth of Lorn, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland.\nIn terms of the overall history of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), the placement of a lifeboat at Oban is a relatively recent decision. An Inshore lifeboat was first stationed here in 1972.\nThe station currently operates 13-50 The Campbell Watson (ON 1357), a Shannon-class All-weather lifeboat, on station since 2024.\nHistory\nWith a general increase in leisure boating activity, and with the nearest lifeboat stations at Islay and Mallaig being over 50 miles (80\u00a0km) away, following a coastal review in 1971, the RNLI decided to place one of their larger Inshore lifeboats at Oban.\nAn 18-foot A-class (McLachlan) Inshore lifeboat A-505 (previously given the All-weather designation 18-005) arrived at Oban on 5 May 1972. The boat was kept at a mooring off the wooden pier, and a small 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) inflatable dinghy was donated by local architect and hotelier Bill Crerar, to be used as the boarding boat. A tin-roofed shed on the South Pier leased from the local council would become the 'lifeboat station', as a place to store all essential equipment.\nThe first call for the lifeboat was just 19 days later on 24 May 1972, when three children, who had set out in their parents' sailing dinghy, found themselves unable to return in the strong winds, and were rescued as their boat headed towards the rocks of Creag Island.\nA new A-class (McLachlan) lifeboat (A-511) was sent to the station in 1973. A contribution of \u00a35000 towards the cost of the boat was received from the North British Hotel Trust. The North British Hotel Trust was set up in 1902, with half the shareholding placed in trust, to ensure that a percentage of the profits were distributed to charitable organisations.\nA service on 24 June 1974 resulted in the lifeboat towing a 16-ton vessel. Another call to two fishing boats, aground at Ardmore Point on Mull, took over two hours to reach the vessels. By 1976, it was clear that the lifeboat was being pushed to her operational limits, and sometimes beyond. In August 1978, Oban became an All-weather lifeboat station, with the arrival of a 42ft Watson-class lifeboat, the Watkin Williams (ON 922). The boat was already 22-years old at that time, but had served well at Moelfre, and been involved in at least two RNLI Gold Medal rescues under the command of Richard Evans. The Inshore boat would remain on service.\nWatkin Williams served Oban for 3 years, before being transferred to the relief fleet in 1981, and sold out of service in 1983. She was replaced for just one year by the Dorothy and Philip Constant (ON 967), another 42ft Watson-class heading for retirement, but this boat had the advantage of being equipped with radar. However, at 8.25 knots, speed was still an issue.\nIn 1982, the A-class (McLachlan) lifeboat was withdrawn, and Oban was the first station to get a new class of lifeboat to replace the Dorothy and Philip Constant. The Brede-class was a 33\u00a0ft (10\u00a0m) intermediate size lifeboat, with a crew of four, designed to meet operational requirements between the rigid inflatable Atlantic 21 class, and the larger lifeboats. Built by Lochin Marine of Rye, it had a GRP (Glass Reinforced Polymer) hull, and her twin Caterpillar 3208NA diesel engines would deliver 19 knots.\nKeen seafarers James and Ann Ritchie, of the Isle of Man brewing company Heron and Brearley, funded a lifeboat for Ramsey, the James Ball Ritchie (ON 995), which arrived on service in 1970, shortly after James' death. Ann Ritchie, n\u00e9e Gough, President of the Ramsey Ladies Lifeboat Guild, decided to fund two more lifeboats: one for Port St Mary, 54-06 Gough Ritchie (ON 1051), and one for Oban. The new Oban lifeboat was named 33-02 Ann Ritchie (ON 1080). Ann formally named the boat at a ceremony on 7 May 1983, and after a short trip on the boat, she was presented with a painting and a Caithness Glass bowl. These were returned to the station on her instruction, following her death in 1990. The residue of her estate became the Gough Ritchie Charitable Trust. One third of its income is distributed to the RNLI for use on the Isle of Man, and has so far funded two more lifeboats.\nAt 03:32 on 31 January 1985, the Oban lifeboat Ann Ritchie was called to the aid of the 80-ton fishing vessel Shemara, aground on Lady's Rock, to the south west of Lismore Island. In poor conditions and shallow water, and in the dark, the 8 crew were rescued after 14 attempts. Awards were made to the coxswain and crew.\n1990s onwards\nTrent-class lifeboat14-23 Mara Edith Macdonald (ON 1227)\nOn 16 July 1997, Oban received the 14.30\u00a0m (46\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) Trent-class lifeboat 14-23 Mara Edith Macdonald (ON 1227). This was a much larger, and much more powerful lifeboat, her twin MAN diesel engines giving a top speed of 25 knots (29\u00a0mph; 46\u00a0km/h). The Trent-class lifeboat served Oban for more than half of the time the station has existed. In ",

    "Scheme between mainland Australia and Tasmania\nSpirit of Tasmania I berthed in Devonport, Tasmania\nThe Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme (BSPVES) is an Australian Government initiative that offers uncapped federal funding to subsidise the cost of ferry travel across Bass Strait. This scheme primarily supports services operated by the Tasmanian Government-owned TT-Line Company Pty Ltd, linking the state of Victoria on the Australian mainland with the island state of Tasmania. The BSPVES also includes provisions for commuters who must fly between mainland Australia and King Island or the Furneaux Group due to the absence of ferry services.\nIn 2022-2023, the BSPVES expended a total of $59.2 million. The most recent adjustment to the scheme\u2019s rebate amounts was made on 7 May 2024, with the new rates effective from 1 July 2024.\nHistory\nIntroduced by the Commonwealth Minister for Transport and Regional Development in September 1996, the BSPVES aimed to bridge the gap in transport costs, making sea travel as equitable as road travel. The Scheme's implementation is seen as the first step in formalising the Sea Highway, a figurative highway linking Tasmania to the Australian mainland's National Highway.\nThe Bureau of Transport Economics (BTE) released its third monitoring report in April 2000, which evaluated the scheme's impact for the 1998/99 period. The report noted that the scheme significantly increased demand for sea travel, resulting in a 12% rise in vehicle numbers and a 9.3% increase in total passenger numbers for TT Line, the primary ferry operator.\nAs a result of the Australian Government temporarily increasing the BSPVES, passengers on the Spirit of Tasmania ferry between Melbourne and Devonport were able to bring their vehicle at no extra charge from 1 March 2021, to 30 June 2021. The free vehicle fares also applied to motorbikes and bicycles, while caravans and camper vans received a discount equivalent to a standard vehicle fare. The initiative was part of the Government's efforts to boost Tasmanian tourism, and encourage Tasmanians to travel interstate and stimulate the Australian economy post-COVID-19.\nRebates\nAdministered by Services Australia on behalf of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts, the scheme operates under Ministerial Directions. Rebates are calculated to match the cost of driving the equivalent distance by highway and are adjusted seasonally. Rebates are generally provided to drivers in the form of reduced fares charged by service operators. If the fare charged by the operator is below the applicable rebate, the rebate amount is capped at the fare charged.\nScheme criticism\nThe original intent of the BSPVES was to ensure transport equity by making the cost of travelling and transporting goods across Bass Strait comparable to that of traveling similar distances on the mainland. However, several modifications and a focus on limited interests within Tasmania have undermined this goal. The scheme has evolved to primarily benefit passenger vehicles, excluding foot passengers and various types of freight, such as southbound consumables and international exports. Critics of the Scheme say it has been rebranded to focus on tourism, benefiting \"driving holidays for mainlanders\" rather than broader economic needs. Unlike land highways, the Sea Highway has not received equivalent funding, undermining its reliability and accessibility. Policy reversals and a lack of implementation have further deviated from the original promises. Administrative inefficiencies and a lack of alignment with public mandates have compounded these issues, hindering Tasmania's economic integration with the mainland.\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme\".

    "Road in Cuba\nThe Sancti Sp\u00edritus\u2013Yaguajay Road (4\u2013531) is a north-south national highway in Sancti Sp\u00edritus Province, Cuba, connecting Sancti Sp\u00edritus to the town of Yaguajay. The road has two sections, the southern half of the road is the Circunvalaci\u00f3n/Autopista Sancti Sp\u00edritus, the motorway section, also known as the 4-66, north of the intersection with the Autopista A1, is the regular Sancti Sp\u00edritus\u2013Yaguajay two lane road, built before the revolution.\nHistory\nIn 2017, from October to November, the Autopista A1 closed past the intersection with the 4\u2013531, for repairs, making it so you had to either go down the circunvalaci\u00f3n Sancti Sp\u00edritus or north to Yaguajay, instead of being able to go straight until Taguasco, then ending at the Maja\u2013Taguasco Road, which was also closed. \nIn 2018, there was damages in the road due to the landslides in the El Yigre area, and inter-municipal transport services where temporary closed due to the weather throughout the province.\nRoute\nThe symbol  indicates the motorway section.\nReferences\n^ \"cuba mapa .com - Sancti Spiritus Province map\". www.cubamapa.com.

    "Baseball promotion for women baseball fans\nThis article is about the baseball promotional even. For the other topics of the same name, see Ladies' Day.\nLadies' Day, also referred to as Ladies' Night if held during night games, was a baseball promotional event in Major League Baseball aimed at women baseball fans from early to mid 20th century. It was a common fixture at baseball stadiums until the rise of the Women's Liberation Movement in the 1970s, after which it was eventually discontinued as it was seen as being discriminatory to men.\nHistory\nFuture Hall of Famer Bucky Harris signing scorecards for women attendees on Ladies' Day, 1925\nThough Ladies' Day had existed in baseball since the 19th century, the idea was to create an environment in the stands free of unsavory characters and conduct and to make baseball a family-oriented event. The New York Gothams reportedly held the first Ladies' Day in 1883.\nLadies' Day was reintroduced in 1913 by Helene Hathaway Britton, the owner of the St. Louis Cardinals and the first woman to own a baseball team. The Cardinals Ladies' Day promotion allowed women free entry to the park if accompanied by a man.\nThe promotion gained popularity after World War I. This was due, in part, to Charles Weeghman, owner of the Chicago Cubs. Weegham had used the promotion during his time with the short-lived Federal League as owner of the Chicago Whales and to promote the park which would eventually become known as Wrigley Field.\nLadies Day promotions began to decline after the case of Abosh v. New York Yankees, Inc. in 1972, where the New York State Human Rights Appeal Board ruled that Ladies' Day was discriminatory \"in a modern technological society where women and men are to be on equal footing as a matter of public policy.\"\nNotable games on Ladies' Day/Night\nSeptember 21, 1933: by a score of 2\u20131, the Washington Senators clinch the pennant on the final day of the season against the 1933 St. Louis Browns on Ladies' Day.\nMay 13, 1940: Johnny Mize of the St. Louis Cardinals hits three home runs against the Cinicinnati Reds. The game ended in an extra-innings tie, called due to darkness. The attendance was noted in The Cincinnati Enquirer as \"6,606 paid, 9,370 women.\"\nMay 18, 1957: At Crosley Field, Willie Mays steals four bases and hits a home run against the 1957 Cincinnati Redlegs.\nMay 11, 1963: Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers no-hits the San Francisco Giants on Ladies' Night at Dodger Stadium, winning 8\u20130. It was his second career no-hitter.\nMay 1, 1965: during a game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, Dodgers' star hitter Tommy Davis breaks his ankle on a slide into second base, putting the Dodgers' pennant chances in jeopardy.\nAugust 26, 1981: Garry Templeton, star shortstop of the St. Louis Cardinals twice makes obscene gestures to fans who are booing him on Ladies' Day. Manager Whitey Herzog physically removed Templeton from the field and had a scuffle with him in the dugout. Templeton was fined $5000 and suspended for three weeks, during which he underwent psychiatric evaluation. The incident caused Templeton to be traded to the San Diego Padres for shortstop Ozzie Smith, who would go on to have a Hall of Fame career with the Cardinals.\nSee also\nWomen in baseball\nReferences\n^ Getzenberg, Alaina (August 14, 2017). \"'Ladies Day' connected women to baseball\".

    "\nBilateral relations\nThe Australia\u2013United States sporting rivalry is one which spreads across multiple sports due to similar sporting cultures within the two countries.\nBasketball\nDue to an explosion of basketball popularity in Australia in the 1980s, a rivalry between the Australians and Americans formed in the ensuing decades. In 1996, Australia was set to compete against the US Dream Team II in the lead up to the 1996 Summer Olympics and NBA star Charles Barkley boldly claimed before the match that \"We are the best country in the world. We\u2019re the best at basketball. We have got to kill them all.\" During the game, Australian guard Shane Heal hit a remarkable 8-from-13 from three-point range and when lining up for one of his shots in the third quarter, Charles Barkley arrived late and aggressively undercut Heal sending him sprawling to the floor in front of the Australian bench. Undaunted by the height and weight differential, Heal, who opponent stood six inches shorter than Barkley, chased the American star back down the court, letting fly with a volley of verbal barbs and bumped chests with Barkley.\nIn August 2019, Australia defeated the United States 98\u201394 for the first time. In recent years, Australia has seen many more players getting drafted into the NBA who have committed to playing for the national team, which has raised the standard of the international play and has resulted in more competitive performances against the United States.\nSurfing\nAustralia and the United States are the two most successful nations in the history of professional surfing and four of the biggest rivalries in surfing history formed in the early 21st century involving Americans Kelly Slater and Andy Irons as well as Australians Mick Fanning and Joel Parkinson.\nSwimming\nAustralian Ian Thorpe famously chased down American Gary Hall Jr. in the final leg of the 4 x 100 metre freestyle relay at 2000 Summer Olympics.\nThe United States and Australia are the two most successful nations in Olympic swimming history and often share the podium with one another at each international meet. An intense rivalry has developed as a result and swimmers from both nations have acknowledged the opposing country as their biggest rival.\nLeading into the 2000 Summer Olympics held in Sydney, Australia, American sprint swimmer Gary Hall Jr. commented on the upcoming 4 x 100 metre freestyle relay event and confidently stated that the US team would \"smash them (Australia) like guitars.\" The US had never been beaten in the near 40-year history of the event and Hall faced a 17-year-old Ian Thorpe in the last leg of the relay. Hall had the better start and came up a body length ahead of Thorpe before clocking a 0.23 second lead at the turn. Thorpe then fought back in the final lap and both swimmers were even with 15 metres to go in front of a raucous Australian crowd. Thorpe would finish first by a hand-length and the Australian swimmers would celebrate the win by playing air guitar on the pool deck.\nThe rivalry reached its most intense level in the lead up to the 2024 Summer Olympics when Australian Cate Campbell stated on a national broadcast that \"It is just so much sweeter beating America. There were a couple of nights, particularly the first night of competition, where we did not have to hear \u2018Star-Spangled Banner\u2019 ring out through the stadium, and I cannot tell you how happy that made me.\" She also mentioned that \"the U.S. have this infernal cowbell they ring. And as someone leaves to go to the competition pool, they ring out, \u2018USA, USA,\u2019 and I have never wanted to punch someone more.\" These statements infuriated the US team with Lilly King stating \"Is it going to be worse if they beat us than somebody else? Yeah.\" Former American swimmer Michael Phelps was also asked to comment on the statements made by the Australian and was visibly deturbed by the comments responding that if he was on the team he'd \"watch  every single day to give me that little extra.\"\nAustralia has not finished ahead of the US in the Olympic swimming medal tally since the 1956 Summer Olympics.\nTennis\nThe United States and Australian Davis Cup are the two most successful nations in Davis Cup history with 32 and 28 titles respectively. The two nations first played each other in the World Group final of the 1905 competition with the United States claiming a clean sweep 5\u20130 victory. The Australian team claimed their first victory over the US team two years later and went on to defeat Great Britain to claim its first ever Davis Cup title.\nThe decades that followed were dominated by the Australian and United States teams and the two nations developed an intense rivalry with one another during a 36-year stretch between 1937 and 1973 in which one of the two nations claimed the Davis Cup title, including 16 straight year in which they played each other in the final. As of the completion of their 2017 meeting, the ledger stands at 26\u201321 in favour of the US. Outside of Davis Cup, countrymen",

    "Australian neopagan organization\nThe First Anglecyn Church of Odin was founded in 1936 in Melbourne, Australia by Alexander Rud Mills, an early proponent of modern Odinism. Mills, a barrister and writer, sought to revive what he considered the ancient religion of the \"British race\", which he believed was more natural and spiritually fitting than Christianity. His theological framework centered on Odin as the supreme deity, integrating elements of Norse mythology with an ideological blend heavily influenced by Aryan and racialist thought.\nMills authored several influential texts, including The First Guide Book to the Anglecyn Church of Odin (1936) and The Odinist Religion: Overcoming Jewish Christianity (1939). These works provided liturgical guidelines and hymns for the church, drawing heavily on Anglican liturgical forms while infusing them with anti-Christian and anti-Semitic sentiments. During World War II, Mills was interned by the Australian government for his Nazi sympathies, which suppressed the church's activities. Despite this, his writings continued to influence later generations of Odinist and \u00c1satr\u00fa practitioners.\nOffshoots\nOne significant offshoot inspired by the First Anglecyn Church of Odin was the Odinist Fellowship, founded by Else Christensen in the United States. Christensen, often referred to as the \"Folk Mother\", was heavily influenced by Alexander Rud Mills's writings and vision for a racially-focused Odinism. She established the Odinist Fellowship in the 1960s, aiming to promote the practice of Odinism within a framework that emphasized the cultural and racial heritage of people of European descent. Christensen's organization became a key player in the modern Odinist movement, spreading Mills's ideas and integrating them into a broader neopagan context.\nKerry Bolton, a New Zealand-based far-right activist and writer, also drew inspiration from the First Anglecyn Church of Odin. In 1980, he founded the Church of Odin as a branch of Mills's original church. Bolton's Church of Odin also considers Christensen's Odinist Fellowship as a parent organization, maintaining strong ideological and organizational ties. Bolton's iteration of the church continued to emphasize the racial and cultural aspects of Odinism, aligning with Mills's original vision and integrating it with his far-right political activities.\nReferences\n^ a b Introvigne (2016).\n^ Winter (2005); Bird (2014).\n^ Bird (2014).\n^ a b c \"Odinism and the History of \u00c1satr\u00fa\".

    "2023 American film\nThe Philadelphia Eleven is a 2023 American documentary about the first women ordained as priests in the Episcopal Church. The long-form documentary was developed by Time Travel Productions to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the ordination of the eleven women who presented themselves for ordination at the Church of the Advocate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 29, 1974.\nSynopsis\nThe ordination of the Philadelphia Eleven was an act of civil disobedience as they were ordained despite the Episcopal Church's prohibition at that time against the female priests. In 1974, there was actually no canon that specifically forbade women from becoming priests, but the Episcopal Church's diocesan standing committees and bishops almost always rejected women's requests for ordination. Prior to their ordination, there had been two failed legislative votes at General Convention to allow the ordination of women. Of the Philadelphia Eleven, only one had received the backing of her standing committee and their bishops refused to ordain them. Three retired bishops agreed to ordain the eleven women despite the fact that it could be seen as a violation of canonical law and church tradition.\nFinding a venue for the ordination was challenging, but the Church of the Advocate, a Black church in Northern Philadelphia invited the group to hold the ordination in their sanctuary. The women were harassed and threatened. Nonetheless, more than 2000 people attended the ordination service of the Philadelphia Eleven and there was a lot of press from all major television networks and print media outlets. The ordination was so controversial that there were threats of violence. The Black Panthers and a group of lesbian bodyguards provided security. To begin the service, the eleven women entered the church through the back door as a security precaution, whereas the traditional approach was to process from the front entrance of the church through the pews.\nAfter their ordination, the new priests continued to receive backlash and even violent threats, and some were ostracized by some friends, family and parishes. The retired bishops, who had ordained them, were censured by the House of Bishops. Several priests, who had invited the new female priests to celebrate Eucharist at their parishes, were charged and convicted of violating church canon.\nNonetheless, the women had allies and more women were also ordained in other parts of the country. This wave of new female priests challenged the patriarchy within Christendom, sought a \"new way\" of providing leadership in the church, and created a blueprint for lasting institutional change.\nFor several years after the ordinations, church leaders debated the validity of the women's ordinations. In September 1976, at General Convention, a new section of the church's ordination canons was approved stating its provisions \"shall be equally applicable to men and women.\" At that time, the ordinations of women in 1974-1975 were approved.\nProduction\nThe Philadelphia Eleven is an unrated American film. It has a running time of 86 minutes.\nMargo Guernsey is the director and producer of the film. Nikki Bramley is the co-producer and the director of photography. The executive producer is Katie Eccles, the editor is Rabab Haj Yahya and the composer is Saul Simon MacWilliams.\nRelease\nThe feature-length documentary premiered in September 2023 at the Church of the Advocate.\nThe Philadelphia Eleven was screened at the Athena Film Festival, Sidewalk Film Festival and the Sedona International Film Festival. It was also screened at special events around the country to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ordination of the Philadelphia Eleven. This included a special screening at the Washington National Cathedral.\nThe film received favorable reviews and numerous honors. It was named \"Best Documentary\" by The Boston Globe's Globe Docs. At the Centre Film Festival, it received the \"Juror's Choice Award.\" At the Dunedin International Film Festival, it won a \"Best Documentary Honorable Mention.\"\nReferences\n^ \"Making Room at the Table: The Story of the Philadelphia Eleven\". discovernewfields.org.

    "\n2020 studio album by JJ Lin\nDrifter / Like You Do (Chinese: \u5016\u5b58\u8005 \u00b7 \u5982\u4f60; pinyin: X\u00ecngc\u00fan Zh\u011b \u00b7 R\u00fa N\u01d0) is the fourteenth studio album and first double album by Singaporean singer JJ Lin, released on 20 October 2020, through Warner Music. The first disc, Drifter, contains six Mandarin songs including the single \"No Turning Back\", which reached number one on the China TME Uni Chart. The second disc, Like You Do, contains eight English songs including the single \"Bedroom\" featuring Anne-Marie, which was released on 22 April 2021.\nBackground and release\nJJ Lin's thirteenth album, Message in a Bottle, was released in December 2017 to commercial success. In early 2020, JJ Lin revealed in the variety show I Am a Singer that he would release a new album by the end of the year.\nSpeculation of the album and the concept of the new album began on 23 August 2020, when JJ Lin posted a new post introducing the idea of \"parallel continuum\" on Weibo and other social media. On 3 September 2020, JJ Lin posted a poster with tag \"#No Turning Back#\" on Weibo as a teaser for Drifter / Like You Do's title song, \"No Turning Back\". The song and its music video was released on 16 September 2020. On 13 October, JJ Lin announced his fourteenth album would be released on 20 October 2020; he would hold a global online listening party for the album the night before the release.\nConception\nJJ Lin assumed creative control over all aspects of the record. The release of Drifter / Like You Do contains two EPs, each with its own storyline. The two storylines were conceived to run parallel and eventually intersect with one another.\nIn Drifter / Like You Do, it brings the idea that time and space are not continuous from quantum theory. The theory leads to the conjecture about the parallel spacetimes. The conception of this album is based on the assumption of the existence of parallel spacetime. JJ Lin mentioned his interpretation to this record on the global listening party and press release. He said that there were light and darkness in our life, and there were also tendency to hold on and to let it go in our conscious. The album is about a rediscovery of our life and tells a story about everyone in this world. He commented, \"My voice could be you, as your voice could be mine.\"\nTitle\nThe name of the first EP Drifter in Chinese means \"survivor\" (Chinese:\u5e78\u5b58\u8005). On the global online listening party JJ Lin held before the album released, JJ Lin believed that everyone living in this universe is a survivor. He stated that he has been prepared this album for three years. Drifter / Like You Do record images and experience JJ Lin experienced during the three years. JJ explained that during this long journey, there were things that people gained, lost and felt regret. There are many regrets that happened under the different circumstance in this album. But, the album is themed on exploring the meaning of time, space, you and me and telling survivors who have many regrets to have a restart.\nTrack listing\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nReferences\n^ \"Singer JJ Lin releases 14th album entitled 'Drifter / Like You Do'\".

    "Czech coachbuilding company\nAero 50 Dynamik with coachwork by Sodomka\nTatra 600 Cabriolet with bodywork by Sodomka\nSodomka was a Czech coachbuilding company founded in 1895. They bodied cars and buses from various Czech companies (Aero, Laurin & Klement, Praga, \u0160koda, Tatra, Walter), as well as foreign cars (e.g. Bugatti, Ford, Graham, Lancia, Nash, Rolls-Royce, LaSalle (for the British royal family), Studebaker and others).\nHistory\nThe Sodomka company was founded in Vysok\u00e9 M\u00fdto in 1895 by Josef Sodomka Sr. It was originally called the First East Bohemian Carriage Manufacture of Josef Sodomka. After the First World War came the Great Depression and the search for another production programme began. Josef Sodomka persuaded his father to start car bodywork. In 1925, they produced the first car body according to their own design on a Praga Mignon chassis. In 1928, the company produced their first bus body on a \u0160koda 125 chassis with a capacity for fourteen passengers and other bus bodies on Praga, \u0160koda, Tatra and Walter chassis. By the end of the year, a total of six buses had been produced at the factory. In the 1930s, Karoserie Sodomka became a successful company, winning elegance competitions and car shows. In total, the company produced 40 buses by 1936. In 1947, the \u0160koda 706 RO bus model began production. In 1948, the company was nationalised and became the national company Karosa. In 2020, the plant belongs to Iveco and buses are produced there.\nLiterature\nJan \u010cern\u00fd: Automobily Tatra s karoseriemi Sodomka, Vysok\u00e9 M\u00fdto, Region\u00e1ln\u00ed muzeum ve Vysok\u00e9m M\u00fdt\u011b, 2007, ISBN\u00a0978-80-239-9453-7\nJan \u010cern\u00fd: Automobily Aero s karoseriemi Sodomka, Vysok\u00e9 M\u00fdto, Region\u00e1ln\u00ed muzeum ve Vysok\u00e9m M\u00fdt\u011b, 2008, ISBN\u00a0978-80-254-2190-1\nJan \u010cern\u00fd: Autobusov\u00e9 karoserie Sodomka na podvozc\u00edch Tatra, Vysok\u00e9 M\u00fdto, Region\u00e1ln\u00ed muzeum ve Vysok\u00e9m M\u00fdt\u011b, 2008, ISBN\u00a0978-80-254-2189-5\nJan \u010cern\u00fd, Martin \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n: Automobily Praga s karoseriemi Sodomka, Vysok\u00e9 M\u00fdto, Region\u00e1ln\u00ed muzeum ve Vysok\u00e9m M\u00fdt\u011b, 2009, ISBN\u00a0978-80-254-4587-7\nJan Tulis: Sodomka, Brno, Autoklub p\u0159i pedagogick\u00e9 fakult\u011b Masarykovy university v Brn\u011b, 1990\nKul\u00ed\u0161ek, V\u00edt\u011bzslav (2018).

    "Enver Pasha's Rebellion (Uzbek:Enver poshoning qo'zg'oloni) refers to an armed uprising that was a part of the much larger Basmachi Revolt. It was conducted by the former Ottoman Minister of War, Enver Pasha.\nThe uprising started in the summer of 1921 when Enver Pasha arrived in Bukhara to negotiate with the Basmachi. He ended up defecting to the Basmachi and began fighting the Bolsheviks. During this period of the Basmachi movement, they reached their peak, but by May 1922, with the start of Bolshevik counteroffensives in Turkestan, the Basmachi began to fall apart. By mid-June, Ibrahim Bek revolted against Enver, sparking a civil conflict that divided the Basmachi. The rebellion was ultimately crushed by August 4, 1922, when Enver Pasha himself was killed.\nBackground\nNegotiations with basmachi in 1921\nAfter the end of World War One, Enver Pasha, along with Djemal Pasha and Talaat Pasha, fled to Germany, where he had to change his identity to 'Ali Bey' due to a military tribunal in Istanbul sentencing the Young Turk trio to death. In 1919, he met with Karl Radek, a representative of the Comintern in Berlin, who offered him a new future\u2014leading the Red Army against the Basmachi. In early 1920, Enver Pasha traveled to Moscow, where he worked for the Society for the Unity of the Revolution with Islam. He promised a marriage between Islam and Communism, aiming to establish a Communist-Muslim union, and pledged to stop the Basmachi and turn them to their side. In June 1921, he arrived in Bukhara with some representatives and officers. Upon his arrival, he wrote a letter to Moscow demanding the immediate withdrawal of troops from Bukhara. When he did not receive a response, he executed the captured men there, thereby starting his rebellion.\nThe uprising\nEnver Pasha soon found his ideas of Muslim socialism popular among the farmers and working class of Eastern Bukhara, but this led to him being shunned by the nobility and many of the Kurbashi. The nobility indirectly supported Ibrahim Bek over Enver, laying the groundwork for a civil conflict between the two. This culminated in Enver Pasha being disarmed and captured during a meeting with Ibrahim Bek. He was later released by the Emir of Bukhara, Seyyid Alim, who appointed him as naib (deputy). In his new position, Enver attempted to gather arms from countries hostile to the local Bolshevik presence, with Afghanistan and the United Kingdom being the most notable, as both were eager to send him supplies. However, the Bolsheviks prevented this and blockaded Bukhara. Despite these setbacks, Enver started his campaign with 20,000 soldiers. His first and biggest victory was in Dushanbe, which he successfully captured after a three-month-long siege. Although they attempted to open the border with China to end the blockade however they failed, they still achieved several victories, including the capture of Karshi and an advance on Bukhara. These defeats greatly alarmed the Bolsheviks, who spent massive resources on a counteroffensive. By May 1922, the Red Army launched a major counteroffensive, recapturing Vakjubent, Gijduvan, Kermine, Baysun, Baljuvon, Korfuk, and on June 14, 1922, the Basmachi suffered arguably their biggest loss with the fall of Dushanbe. Around this time, a civil conflict finally broke out between Ibrahim and Enver, leading to significant losses for Enver. By July, he attempted to retreat to Afghanistan, but he was caught in an ambush near Dushanbe in Baljuvan and died in combat against the Armenian Bolshevik commander, Yakov Melkumov, Ending his revolt.\nAftermath\nThe Basmachi movement reached its peak under Enver Pasha and never quite returned to the same strength afterward. The Bolsheviks resumed their conflict with Ibrahim Bek, and at this point, the main strategy of the Basmachi involved cross-border operations along the Afghan-Soviet border. These operations ultimately culminated in direct Soviet interventions into Afghanistan, such as in 1929 when the Soviets attempted to prevent the Saqqawist takeover. The Basmachi movement truly came to an end by 1938 with the death of Junaid Khan.\nReferences\n^ a b c \"\u0411\u0410\u0421\u041c\u0410\u0427\u0415\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0415 \u0414\u0412\u0418\u0416\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0415 | \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\". www.krugosvet.ru (in Russian).

Per the stipulation, since Kamitani was the last wrestler eliminated, AZM, Hina, Lady C, and Amasaki all had to leave Queen's Quest, assenting Kamitani to remain the sole member of the unit in the process. AZM and Miyu Amasaki attracted the attention of Crazy Star's Suzu Suzuki and Mei Seira, and Starlight Kid who spent a couple of months as a solitary wrestler after being kicked out of Oedo Tai.\nOn the first night of the Stardom Sapporo World Rendezvous from July 27, 2024, Kid, AZM, Seira, Suzuki and Amasaki officiated the birth of the \"Neo Genesis\" unit as they defeated Stars (Hazuki, Koguma, Hanan, Saya Iida and Momo Kohgo) in a ten-woman tag team match as their inaugural bout.

    "United States historic place\nThe United States Post Office Plymouth Station is a former post office located at 860 Penniman Avenue in Plymouth, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2024. The building houses Westborn Market.\nHistory\nA call for bids for the construction of this post office was first announced in July 1934. However, it was not until May 1935 that the construction bid was awarded to local builder Henry Martens. Construction began in July of that year, and the building was finished by March 1936. Postal employees moved into the new building at the end of the month, and it was opened to the public on April 1, 1936.\nAn addition at the rear of the building was constructed in 1959. However, by the 2000s, the post office building was too large, and USPS closed the building to move to a smaller space. In 2014, Plymouth couple Mark and Patty Malcolm purchased the building and made improvements. They then leased it to Westborn Market. Westborn Market opened in the building in 2018.\nDescription\nThe United States Post Office Plymouth Station is a single-story Classical Revival red brick structure with limestone accents. The original building measures sixty feet by sixty-six feet; the 1959 addition measures 108 feet by eight-six feet. The main fa\u00e7ade is symmetrical and three bays wide, with a large, slightly recessed central entrance bay. Wide brick pilasters within the bay separate the central entrance from windows to each side. The door and windows are set in stone surrounds, and a stone cornice tops the bay.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Weekly List 2024 07 26\". National Park Service. July 26, 2024.

    "Waterfall in the Philippines\nAsik-Asik Falls, also known as Dulao Falls, is a waterfall near Alamada in Cotabato, the Philippines, on the slopes of Mount Ragang. It is known for an apparent lack of a river feeding the fall, with water coming out of crevices on a 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) tall cliff instead. It receives over 500 tourists on weekdays and 1,000 on weekends. Asik means \"sprinkle\" in the Hiligaynon language. Much of the falls are surrounded and covered by lush vegetation, such as ferns and moss.\nIt is theorized that the source of the falls is an underground river. The pool at the bottom flows into the Alamada River, a tributary of the Libungan River.\nHistory\nAsik-Asik Falls were accidentally discovered in late 2010 when Jun Miranda, a member of a barangay council, explored the area when assessing the damage from some forest fires, landslides, and floods that had impacted the region. The villagers in Dulao knew of the falls' existence and unusual aspects prior, but they did not make a deal of it, as it was very forested and relatively inaccessible. Miranda told the council of what he had discovered, and many officials went to see it for themselves. They uploaded images to social media, which quickly spread.\nIn July 2013, a picture of the falls taken by Ernestina Jacinta became one of the grand winners in a photo contest ran by the state-owned Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation. The falls were closed for tourism for two months in 2014 after a cholera outbreak in the surrounding villages.\nOther variations\nOther than the considered discovery, other variations of the discovery are circulating, some say that the falls were discovered in a military operation, while others say locals found it.\nReferences\n^ Campa\u00f1a, Dan (November 26, 2018). \"The Majestic Asik-asik Falls\".

    "1989 science fiction novel by K. W. Jeter\nFarewell Horizontal is a science fiction novel by American writer K. W. Jeter, published in 1989. It came in second for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1990, and was a finalist for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1991. The novel deals with themes of information access, security, and reliability.\nPlot\nThe novel takes place inside and on the exterior of a megastructural cylindrical building called Cylinder, which one character says \"violates at least a dozen laws of physics.\" It is not explained how this building can exist, or why it was built or by whom.\nThe novel begins with Ny Axxter, a \"graffex\" (graphic designer) on the exterior surface of the building trying to make a living as a freelancer, selling content to Ask & Receive, an information repository and apparent monopoly.\nAxxter discovers a location where the exterior of the building has been blown out by an explosion and the interior rooms are full of corpses. He attributes this to bogeymen called the Dead Centers that live in the sealed off center sections of Cylinder.\nAxxter gets a job working for one of the warrior tribes that inhabit the exterior of the building, redesigning their graphical branding identity. But the big reveal is hacked, apparently by the company that previously designed the tribe's graphics, embarrassing the tribe and leading to Axxter fleeing for his life.\nAided by a gas angel (a humanoid with a large gas bag growing out of its back so it can float in the atmosphere around the building) Axxter ends up on the far side of Cylinder. Axxter hatches a plan to travel through the center of the building back home, and to report on his odyssey as a form of entertainment for residents of Cylinder.\nAlong the way Axxter meets and is aided by a hacker who can move between bodies stashed in different parts of the building, and a Dead Center who teaches Axxter about an alternate information source to Ask & Receive.\nAxxter learns that the destruction of the site that he discovered at the start of the novel was not done by the Dead Centers, but instead by a collaboration between the two most powerful warrior tribes on the building, enabled by doctored information from Ask & Receive. Axxter broadcasts this information to the entire building, leading to the collapse of the dominant power structure of Cylinder.\nReferences\n^ \"Farewell Horizontal by K.W.

    "American singer-songwriter\nMusical artist\nKarina Rykman (born Karina Rajchman) is an Indie/Jam Rock singer-songwriter, bassist, and guitarist from New York.\nEarly life\nKarina Rykman grew up in New York City, the daughter of two Columbia professors with specialties in philosophy, French, and art history. Her father is philosopher John Rajchman, and her grandfather is Jan A. Rajchman, a Polish-American computer scientist. Her father introduced her to classical music such as Bach's Goldberg Variations, rather than rock & roll.\nWhile attending the Upper West Side's Calhoun School,  she became obsessed with rock music after learning to play the White Stripes' \"Seven Nation Army\" on an acoustic guitar in the 8th grade.\nAt age 13, she started her first band, False Arrest, with whom she played shows at The Knitting Factory, Don Hills, and various New York City nightclubs. She then went on to play in a multitude of local bands throughout high school. She graduated from NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized study in 2016, with a concentration in \"Invention & Distribution In Contemporary Music\".\nMusic career\nBy the time Rykman was as teenager, she had landed several high-profile gigs which included America's Got Talent and backing up pop star Julia Michaels on The Today Show. As a teen, Rykman played in the indie-rock band The Sound of Urchin.\nWhile studying at Tomato's House Of Rock, a School Of Rock-adjacent afterschool program, she drew the attention of Ween bassist Dave Dreiwitz who would ask her to play guitar in his power trio, Crescent Moon.  Later, when Dreiwitz had to step away as bass player in pianist Marco Benevento's band due to Ween's comeback, he recommended Rykman as the obvious replacement. Rykman replaced Dreiwitz in Marco Benevento's band in 2016 and has been a fixture in the band since.\nIn 2019, she wrote and recorded her first original song, \"Plants\". Before she had two singles to her name, Rykman had already opened for bands such as Khruangbin and Guster. Her repertoire and her audience grew organically from there, recording and self-releasing several singles while playing headlining shows and many summer festivals.\nWhile playing at The Peach Festival in 2021, she re-connected with Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio. The guitarist, whom she had originally met while in middle school with his daughters, offered to produce her debut album \u2018Joyride.' The album was recorded at The Barn (recording studio) where many Phish albums were written and recorded.\nRykman has appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers on multiple occasions while serving as a substitute bassist for the 8G Band.\nIn April 2024, Rykman opened for the rock band My Morning Jacket in Detroit, joining the band on stage for a cover of a Radiohead song. Rykman has recorded a cover of an early Billie Eilish track \u201cOcean Eyes\u201d with rock band The Gaslight Anthem.\nDiscography\nAlbums\nJoyride (Independent, August 18, 2023)\nReferences\n^ Walis, Em (30 November 2022). \"Karina Rykman Talks Seth Myers, Marco Benevento, Upstate NY And December Tour\".

    "Australian swimmer (born 2001)\nJoshua Yong (born 24 July 2001) is a Bruneian-born Australian swimmer. He competed in the mixed 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley relay at the 2024 Summer Olympics, where he won a bronze medal.\nEarly life and education\nYong was born in Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital city of Brunei, on 24 July 2001. Until the age of 11, he studied for most of his junior year in this small nation on the island of Borneo. He didn't get a chance to work harder on some sets until the school holidays arrived. On 2 October 2011, he competed in the Boys 10 & Under 100 LC Meter, Boys 10 & Under 100 LC Meter Backstroke, and Boys 10 & Under 100 LC Meter Freestyle events in the Brunei 100-meter sprint swimming championship on behalf of his school, Jerudong International School.\nHe spent time in Melbourne throughout the summer, and later relocated to Perth in order to pursue his swimming career. While in Melbourne, he alongside his younger brother, Jayden, trained with the Casey TigerSharks throughout the summer break, together with his family. \"I started learning to swim when I was about three years old, and I just loved it,\" he said.\nHe migrated to the Sunshine Coast in 2021 and joined the USC Spartans swimming club, following his coach, before coming back to Perth in 2022. He started swimming competitively at the age of eight, having learned to swim at the age of three. His career took off once he relocated to Perth to train at West Coast Swimming Club under Mick Palfrey. At the University of Western Australia (UWA) in Perth, he studies engineering. With the support of the Student Athlete Development Program, he is pursuing postgraduate studies after earning a Bachelor of Science from UWA. Joshua describes his work as \"helping athletes balance sport and study.\"\nSwimming career\nAt the 2019 World Junior Championships in Budapest, Yong participated in the men's and mixed medley relays as well as all three breaststroke events, marking his first international competition as an Australian. After that, he competed in his first Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, where he advanced to the 50- and 100-meter breaststroke semifinals. After cutting 0.16 off his previous personal best time of 59.99 at the competition, he began in 28.51 and ended in 31.32, tying Daniel Cave for the seventh-highest Australian performance in history.\nYong teamed up with Matthew Temple, Isaac Cooper, Kyle Chalmers, and others at the 2022 short course world championships to win gold in the 4x100-meter medley relay and establish a world record of 3:18.98. In 2023, he won silver medals in the 50- and 100-meter breaststroke events in Australia. He won bronze in the 200-meter breaststroke in the Gold Coast Australian Age and MC Age Championships in 2024, trailing only visiting Japanese star Ippei Watanabe and Zac Stubblety-Cook with a time of 2:07.62, a full three seconds faster than his previous best.\nThen Yong broke the traditional Approach during the 2024 Swimming Australia Olympic Trials in Brisbane, first by swimming the 200-meter breaststroke in 2:07.40 to 2:08.08 seconds behind reigning Olympic champion Zac Stubblety-Cook, and then coming in second to Sam Williamson in the 100-meter breaststroke. With a personal best time of 59.48, he almost missed the Olympic qualifying standard by a mere 0.01 seconds.\nAt the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Yong competed in several events. In the men's 100-metre breaststroke, he finished in 12th place. He ranked 8th in the men's 200-metre breaststroke. He swam in both the prelims and finals for the men's 4 x 100-metre medley relay, which unfortunately did not medal. However, his team secured 3rd place in the mixed 4 x 100-metre medley relay, earning him a bronze and his first Olympic medal of his career.\nReferences\n^ a b \"How I balance sport and study - hear from artistic competitive swimmer Joshua\".

    "Medieval stronghold\nThe Asara Fortress (Bulgarian: \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u0410\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430) is a medieval stronghold located about a kilometer southwest from the village Zvezdel in Kardzhali Province of southern Bulgaria. This fortress played a crucial role in defending the land of the Eastern Rhodopes.\nConstruction and use\nThe fortress was built between the 11th and 12th centuries and occupied a strategically advantageous location on a rock sanctuary, which also featured a rock tomb from the mid-13th century BC to the 7th-6th centuries BC. This fortification included two rectangular towers on the western and eastern sides, while a wooden palisade encircled the northern and southern perimeters.\nThe eastern side was fortified with one of two square towers that guarded the entrance to the fortress. The lower floor of this tower was designed as a water reservoir, with its base coated in hydrophobic pink mortar. Additionally, a 20\u00a0cm layer of purified sand was found, indicating a filtration system for the water. The floor was intentionally sloped in one corner to facilitate the drainage of precipitation.\nIn contrast to more common fortifications in the region, the majority of the fortress walls were constructed from wood, a notable rarity in Bulgaria, and particularly at the time the fortress was constructed. The two towers were linked by a rock passageway. Within one of the towers, a chapel was discovered, along with remnants of murals. The fortress was primarily tasked with overseeing and protecting the Zvezdel Mine, which at the time extracted gold and silver. Among the significant archaeological finds were an icon embellished with gold leaf and various bone medallions, some of which are now exhibited at the Regional History Museum in Kardzhali.\nThe fortress is believed to have fallen during the Bulgarian-Byzantine wars of 1205\u20131207. Its commanding position, exceptional visibility, and natural defenses made it a crucial asset for Byzantine control over the Eastern Rhodopes.\nReferences\n^ \"Asara fortress\".

Onassis Foundation to the Greek State. It is a non-profit legal entity under private law and operates under the supervision of the Greek Ministry of Health and Social Insurance. It is located in Kallithea, Athens, at the end of Syngrou Avenue (Syngrou 356).\nThe Onassio Cardiac Surgery Center was the scene where the last act of the active political life of Andreas Papandreou, prime minister of Greece and protagonist of its public life for decades, took place. For 4 months, from 29 November 1995 to 21 March 1996, Papandreou was hospitalized at Onassio, submitting his resignation as prime minister on 15 January 1996.\nHistory\nOne of the goals of the \"Alexander S. Onassis\" Charitable Foundation (which was founded in 1975 by the daughter of Aristotle Onassis, Christina) was the creation of a modern cardiac surgery center in Athens, since, while cardiac surgeries had already begun to be performed in Greece, the capabilities of state hospitals could not meet the needs of the Greek population, resulting in the ever-increasing exodus of a large number of heart patients abroad.\nConstruction work began in October 1987 (the foundation stone was laid on October 8, 1987, by the then Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who was to become the most famous patient of Onassios) and was completed in September 1992. On October 6, 1992, the official opening of the operation took place of the center.\nOnassio cost a total of 75 million dollars (at the exchange rate prevailing in 1992) and is located on an area of 8,000 sq.m. A large part of the total cost was allocated to furnishing the center with the most advanced technical means of operation and the most modern scientific instruments.\nReferences\n^ a b \u03a9\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf \u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u039a\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\n^ a b c \u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\n",
    "Indian singer and drummer\nMark Revlon Fernandes is an Indian singer, drummer, and music producer. Referred to as the \"Prince of Goa\" by The Goan, he initially joined his brother Luke's band as a drummer and singer in 1996. Subsequently, he formed a four-piece band called Headlines with Luke. He gained popularity following the single releases of \"Ek ek dis\", \"Dis Udelho\", and \"Rise as one Goa\", as well as cover songs \"Celina\" and \"Sopnam\". An autodidactic musician, he is the bandleader of the Mark Revlon Band.\nEarly life\nMark Revlon Fernandes was born on 14 August. He has a brother named Luke. Fernandes was exposed to music from a young age, as his father was a tiatrist - a performer in the Goan theater tradition. Watching his father entertain audiences with musical performances had an impact on him, inspiring him to pursue a career in music. During his formative years, he nurtured a fascination for music, with a specific emphasis on the art of drumming. In the absence of formal training, he independently learned how to play the drums through self-instruction.\nFernandes described how, during his childhood, he honed his skills by using everyday objects such as pots and pans to create rhythmic sounds through practice, which helped nurture his passion for percussion. He also has personal connections to the cultural traditions of Goa. Fernandes has ancestral roots in Vanxim island through his maternal grandmother and often visited the island during his childhood breaks, immersing in the local festivities, including the Bonderam harvest festival in Divar island. Prior to his musical career, he was involved in amateur football, participating in inter-village competitions.\nCareer\nFernandes' initial introduction to music occurred in 1996 when his brother Luke introduced him to the musical world. At the time, Fernandes took up music despite the technological limitations of the era. His brother Luke, a musician, facilitated his exposure to music by supplying him with cassette tapes and CDs to enhance his singing and percussion abilities. In the year 1994, Luke initiated the formation of a musical ensemble, with Fernandes becoming a member in 1996. Luke would share recordings by artists such as Freddie Mercury and Boney M. with Fernandes, exposing him to a variety of musical influences. Additionally, Fernandes expanded his musical knowledge by engaging with a variety of music genres broadcast on the radio.\nFernandes performing live in 2019.\nThe four-piece musical group \"Headlines\" was formed in 1996 by the Fernandes brothers in Goa. The band's original lineup consisted of Franky on the keyboard, Edmund performed on bass, Chris was responsible for the lead guitar, and Fernandes contributed on drums and as the lead singer. The formation of Headlines followed the earlier breakup of a band that had been started by Luke in 1994. This earlier group's dissolution led the Fernandes brothers to come together and establish the new four-piece ensemble. In terms of their musical style, Headlines is described as blending elements of dance and song.\nFernandes's repertoire features a mix of original compositions as well as cover versions of other artists' works. Some of the Fernandes's popular original songs include \"Ek ek dis\", \"Dis Udelho\", and \"Rise as one Goa\", which has gained him popularity among Goan audiences. Additionally he performed covers, such as \"Celina\" and \"Sopnam\", that have been well received by Goan music fans both locally and internationally. Headlines has primarily directed its live performances towards the state of Goa, seeking to harmonize their artistic aspirations with the musical preferences of their regional audience.\nFernandes is known for his multilingual repertoire and international performances. In 2014, he took part in the United Kingdom's singing competition known as the Voice of UK, though he did not advance past the second round. Lacking formal vocal training, he expressed satisfaction in making it as far as he did in the competition. Fernandes is adept at singing in a diverse range of Indian and foreign languages, including Hindi, Konkani, and Marathi, as well as English, Portuguese, Kazakh, Italian, and Russian, respectively. His linguistic versatility allows him to cater to diverse audiences, particularly Goan listeners, for whom he performs songs in Konkani in addition to Hindi and English. He has maintained an active international performance schedule, appearing at nightclubs and other events in the United States, Australia, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Macau, Kazakhstan, the United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, Switzerland, and England. In reflecting on his musical journey, he has emphasized the importance of community support and the challenges of composing original material.\nFernandes wearing a war bonnet during a live performance in 2019.\nFernandes collaborated with Royston and Revlon Jackson in 2017 to create the audiovisual music track \"Rise as One\".

    "2002 live album by Larisa Dolina and Igor Butman's Big Band\nCarnival of Jazz is a 2002 double live album by Russian singer Larisa Dolina, recorded with the participation of saxophonist Igor Butman and his big band.\nOverview\nFor Larisa Dolina, this was the first purely jazz concert program in the last seventeen years. Its premiere took place on April 27 at the Moscow concert hall \"Russia\" with a full house. The program featured the most famous jazz standards and world-famous hits in jazz processing. For the concert program \"Carnival of Jazz\", as well as for outstanding achievements in the field of culture and art, Dolina was nominated for the State Prize in the field of culture and art.\nThe album was released in December 2002 and included selected numbers recorded during the artists' tours of cities in Russia, the United States, Germany, Israel, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia. In addition to the CD, the concert was also released on DVD, which also included the rehearsal process of its preparation.\nCritical reception\nDmitry Bebenin in a review for the website Zvuki.ru\u00a0 stated that such a grand prima as Larisa Dolina, with her gorgeous voice, could not stay away from the revival of normal music, and the restless manic \"jazzophrenic\" Igor Butman, who in recent years has developed a stormy and fruitful activity in the field of popularization of real noble jazz, turned out to be very welcome here. He positively assessed the issue of standards: \"The funky\u2013all innovatively, and without any hints of \"popness\"\u2014version of the classic \"Night and Day\" is able to \"get out of the game\" even Red Hot Chili Peppers. At the same time, the classic \"Georgia on My Mind\" strictly follows the spirit and letter of the original. It was not without pop and rock inclusions.

    "\nArgentine thoroughbred racehorse\nSeductor (28 August 1943\u20131966?) was an Argentine thoroughbred racehorse and leading sire.\nBackground\nSeductor was bred by Haras Argentino.\nSeductor was a light bay stallion with a heavy build. His hind legs were strongly built, especially his gaskins and quarters, and he had excellent shoulders.\nRacing career\nSeductor was considered one of the leading racehorses of his generation in Argentina.\nIn the Gran Premio Jockey Club, Seductor was ridden by the famous jockey Irineo Leguisamo. In the stretch, he passed the front-running favorite and winner of the Polla de Potrillos, Remo, to win by three-quarters of a length in a final time of 2:034\u20445 for the 2000 meters. The win was the sixth Gran Premio Jockey Club win for Leguisamo and the second for Seductor's sire, Full Sail.\nThe Gran Premio Nacional attracted the largest crowd to Hip\u00f3dromo Argentino de Palermo since the match race between Botafogo and Grey Fox in 1918. That day's card set a record for betting handle in South America of m$n7,603,876. Seductor was the favorite, with field also including Remo, who had lost for the first time in the Gran Premio Jockey Club, Pinturera, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n, HORSES\nSedcutor took the early lead in the race and set a fast pace. 100 meters into the 2500-meter race, Carat\u00f3n passed Seductor to take the lead and Remo came up to run next to Seductor in second. Around the first turn, Remo took the lead and Seductor fell back to fourth behind El Gurisito and Carat\u00f3n. On the backstretch, El Gurisito took the lead, quickly opening up a 4 length lead. He maintained this lead into the final turn, at which point Seductor was running in joint-third with Recien behind Remo and Pinturera. In the stretch, Seductor made his move along with Cabur\u00e9. 150 meters from the finish, Cabur\u00e9 took the lead from Remo with Seductor close behind. Seductor passed Cabur\u00e9 to win the race a neck in a final time of 2:362\u20445.\nFollowing the Gran Premio Nacional, Seductor ran in the Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini, finishing fourth behind Acad\u00e9mico, who had beaten him previously in a non-stakes races, although Seductor was bumped in the race. Following the loss, Seductor won the Cl\u00e1sico Comparaci\u00f3n, again defeating Cabur\u00e9.\nAlong with Acad\u00e9mico, Seductor was named one of the best three-year-olds in Argentina in 1946 and rated equal to him at 132 pounds for 2500 meters. Seductor was the leading horse in Argentina in 1946 by earnings.\nSeductor was set to ship to Brazil to race in 1947, but didn't race again following the Cl\u00e1sico Comparaci\u00f3n.\nStud career\nAfter his racing career, Seductor was acquired by Miguel and Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz. He stood at stud at Haras Chapadmalal, Haras Comalal, and Haras Malal Hu\u00e9.\nSeductor stamped his offspring with his own appearance, and his fillies generally did better than his colts. He is noted to have done well with mares by Rustom Pasha. As a broodmare sire, he nicked with Court Harwell.\nThe mare Starling II, by Noble Star, was bred to Seductor multiple times, producing the full siblings Sideral, Sid\u00e9rea, and Sagitaria, all successful and notable racers.\nAccording to the Jockey Club, Seductor sired 252 foals, including 32 (12.7%) stakes winners. He was the damsire of over 30 more stakes winners.\nSeductor was third on the Argentine general sire list in 1962, and fourth in 1953 and 1957. Seductor led the Argentine broodmare sire list in 1965, was second in 1968, 1969, and 1970, and third in 1967 and 1971.\nNotable progeny\nSideral, Argentine Champion Older Horse, winner of the Cl\u00e1sico Comparaci\u00f3n, etc. Champion sire.\nCarlinga, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n, Gran Premio San Isidro, Cl\u00e1sico Ignacio Correas, etc.\nSid\u00e9rea, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n, Cl\u00e1sico Criadores, Cl\u00e1sico Jorge Atucha, etc.\nSagitaria, undefeated winner of the Gran Premio Saturnino J.

    "1965 aviation incident in London\nThis article is about the 1965 crash. For the 1971 crash, see British European Airways Flight 706 (1971).\nThe 1965 British European Airways Flight 706 was a domestic flight operated by a Vickers Vanguard 951 aircraft of British European Airways (BEA). On Wednesday, 27 October 1965, the aircraft crashed during landing at London Heathrow Airport, causing the deaths of all 36 people on board.  At the time It was one of the deadliest aviation disasters in the United Kingdom.\nAircraft\nThe Vickers Vanguard 951, registered as G-APEE, was a turboprop airliner built in 1959. It was designed for short- and medium-range flights and was then one of the fastest turboprop airliners.\nCircumstances\nThe aircraft was on a scheduled flight from Edinburgh Turnhouse Airport to Heathrow. The flight departed from Edinburgh at 23:17 on 26 October. The flight was uneventful until the aircraft approached London when, during the final approach to runway 28R, the aircraft encountered fog, with reports indicating visibility was less than 50 metres. Making an ILS approach with ATC talking it down through Precision Approach Radar, the aircraft overshot the runway twice and then entered hold. On hearing another Vanguard had made its landing, the pilot made another attempt but on its final approach to runway 28R, the crew decided to overshoot, taking the nose up and reducing flaps. However the aircraft crashed 2,600 feet from the threshold at around 01:23 and burst into flames, killing everyone on board.\nInvestigation and findings\nThe investigation into the crash revealed several key factors:\nThe visibility at the time of the crash was significantly below the required minimum for landing. Despite this, there was no evidence that the pilot was operating below the prescribed limits set by BEA for such conditions.\nThe investigation attributed the crash to pilot error. Contributing factors included low visibility, incorrect information given to the pilot, pilot fatigue, anxiety, lack of experience in landing in fog, and a series of procedural errors during the landing attempts. The aircraft had performed two missed approaches before the crash, and the final approach was marked by an incorrect flap selection and a misjudged descent rate, leading to a steep dive into the runway.\nMemorial\nA memorial plaque was installed at Edinburgh Airport to honour the victims of the crash. The tragic event is remembered as one of the significant accidents in BEA's history, contributing to advancements in aviation safety and maintenance protocols.\nSee also\nList of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft\nAviation safety\nReferences\n^ \"Crash of a Vickers 951 Vanguard in London: 36 killed\".

    "\nFortification in Nagasaki, Japan\nThe Nagasaki Battery Sites (\u9577\u5d0e\u53f0\u5834\u8de1, Nagasaki Daiba-ato) were a group of 23 coastal artillery batteries erected to protect the port of Nagasaki in what is now Nagasaki Prefecture on the island of Kyushu Japan during the Edo Period Tokugawa shogunate. The ruins one of these sites was designated a National Historic Site in 1986 with the additional sites added to the designation in 2014 and 2020.\nOverview\nDuring the Edo period, numerous coastal defense batteries were built in and around Nagasaki in Hizen Province, which was tenry\u014d territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate, and the only place in Japan that was open to foreign trade during the period of Japan's national isolation policy. In 1641, the Nishidomari and Tomachi guardhouses were established at the entrance to the port.  In 1654, seven gun batteries were built at the entrance to the port. As the number of incursions by foreign vessels increased in the early 19th century and Western powers were expanding their colonial empires in Asia and making more insistent demands that Japan allow trade, five more fortifications were constructed in 1808. However, that same year the HMS Phaeton (1782)#Nagasaki Harbour Incident occurred, in which a Royal Navy frigate, HMS Phaeton entered Nagasaki harbor under a false flag, attacked the Dutch trading post at Dejima, and demanded supplies (water, food and fuel) from the Japanese authorities on threat of destruction of the city. The cannons in the Japanese harbour defenses were old and most could not even fire. At the time, it was the Saga Domain's turn to protect Nagasaki, but they had economized by stationing only 100 troops there, instead of the 1,000 officially required. Consequently, the meager Japanese forces in Nagasaki were seriously out-gunned and unable to intervene.. The incident led to the construction of four more gun batteries. \nThere are a total of 23 recorded Nagasaki gun batteries, of which the following three are designated as national historic sites:\nThe Uomidake Battery (\u9b5a\u898b\u5cb3\u53f0\u5834\u8de1) was completed in 1810 by Fukuoka Domain and was armed with 22 cannon. It was located on the western slope of Uomidake, defending the entrance to Nagasaki Port opposite the Kanzaki Battery built at Kozakihana. The remains of the battery and the gunpowder magazine remain. The battery consists of the Sannomasu Battery, which  is a deformed hexagon, followed by the nearly rectangular Ninomasu Battery and the L-shaped Ichinomasu Battery, with the first two separated by over 100 meters, and the second two separated by over 30 meters. Three plots are lined up one above the other, almost adjacent to the north of Sannomasu Battery and Ninomasu Battery, with the lower section containing tool sheds and living quarters, and the middle section being a square area of unknown use. The upper section is 24 meters above the middle section, where a stone storehouse (the gunpowder magazine) was built, but no other buildings remain. This stone storehouse is a single-story building with a tiled roof measuring 3.5 x 3.7 meters in plan, and is in good condition. It was designated a national historic site in 1986. \nThe Shirogashima Battery (\u56db\u90ce\u30f6\u5cf6\u53f0\u5834\u8de1) was built in 1853 by Saga Domain, and reflects the introduction of Western military technology, such as breastworks. It is the last of the 23 to be completed. The battery was located on a small island measuring approximately 220 meters east-to-west and 120 meters north-to-south, located on the edge of the outer edge of Nagasaki Port, approximately 200 meters southwest of the Kaminoshima area. Saga Domain recognized the need for defense outside Nagasaki Port proper  in order to strengthen security. The interior of Shirogashima was excavated and the surrounding area was reinforced with breastworks made of stones and banks, forming an upper and lower enclosure. Western-style castle construction techniques were used in the construction, and arc-shaped and bastion-shaped breastworks were adopted, along with earthworks and the introduction of Western-style cannons, including two 150-pounder cannons. The Nagasaki City Board of Education conducted excavation surveys of the interior of the old battery site and surveyed the outer stone wall facing the coast on the northern edge in 2009 and 2010. The outer stone wall has a total length of approximately 96 meters at the top, a total length of approximately 112 meters at the base, and a height of 4 to 11 meters, and continues in a slightly folding screen shape. It is made of sandstone. Although there has been some collapse at the base, overall it remains in the same condition as when it was first built. The remains of an ammunition storehouse from that time was also discovered.  It was added to the National Historic Site designation in 2014.\nThe  Megami Battery (\u5973\u795e\u53f0\u5834\u8de1) was one of the original fortifications completed in 1654, but was extensively expanded and rebuilt in 1808. No remains of the battery itself have survived,",

    "British novelist and needlework writer\nElizabeth Glaister (April 21, 1839 \u2013 May 10, 1892) was a British novelist and needlework writer.\nLife\nGlaister was born in Beckley in 1839. Her parents were Elizabeth (born Burrill) and the Reverend William Glaister. She was the first of their four children. Her father was the rector of All Saints Church in Beckley in Sussex. Her father died in 1861 and her brother, another Reverend William Glaister, became an important figure in her life. In 1871, she and her mother and two of her siblings, Lucinda and Harry, moved from Hastings to be closer to her brother in Southwell in Nottinghamshire.\n\"The Burgage\" in Southwell is now a listed building\nIn 1873, Marcus Ward & Co. published her first novel, The Markhams of Ollerton which referred to the church of Southwell Minster.\nHer brother, William, was the curate and later vicar of St Wulfram's Church, Grantham (in 1876). Elizabeth created ecclesiastical embroideries for the church and in 1878 her brother published a book about the \"Life and Times of S Wulfram\".\nShe and her cousin, Mortimer Sarah Lockwood, worked together to create a study of Art Needlework that was published in 1878. It was an early study of \"Art Embroidery\" that was \"a Treatise on the Revived Practice of Decorative Needlework\".\nIn 1880 she published a book titled \"Needlework\". It was requested by Macmillan & Co for a series of books they published called Art at Home. It had mixed reviews, the Westminster Review called it \"amateurish\" and of not \"much use to any practised worker in silk of crewell\" even though it had included material from her previous work and designs by Thomas Crane. Myra\u2019s Journal of Dress and Fashion noted that her volume gave \"much needed counsel\".\nGlaister died in Southwell in 1892 in The Burbage.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f Hulse, Lynn (2024-07-11), \"Glaister, Elizabeth (1839\u20131892), author and embroiderer\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, doi:10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.013.90000382472, ISBN\u00a0978-0-19-861412-8, retrieved August 1, 2024\n^ a b \"Author: Elizabeth Glaister\". www.victorianresearch.org.

    "Ghost town in Washington, United States\nBurnt Ridge, a landform and locale, was a small community that existed approximately between the 1880s and into the 1940s. The town was located approximately 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) east of Onalaska.\nHistory\nTelephone lines were connected to the community at a local store in 1909. The town had a dance hall under the Burnt Ridge Community Club and another hall for the Burnt Ridge American Legion. A church known as the Full Gospel Church burned down in 1935. The area became known, starting in the late-20th century, for a 3,000-acre (1,200\u00a0ha) privately owned parcel with a large horse trail system that would sometimes be open to the public. An annual event known as \"Fun Ride\" took place and riders traversed over a 12-mile (19\u00a0km) loop trail.\nEducation\nThe Burnt Ridge school began in a log cabin structure, built out of one tree, in the late 1880s. It was replaced with a new building in 1905. The school was the sight of a disagreement that escalated to the county attorney general when a dance, deemed by some residents to be inappropriate, was held in the building during the Christmas season in 1913. The enrollment of Burnt Ridge District No. 40 was never large, with 11 students counted in 1914. That same year, the school adopted a \"home credit\" system which included credits for such tasks as cleaning one's teeth, feeding livestock, going to bed at a certain time, making or preparing food, or completing other various household chores.\nA new two-room schoolhouse, made of hollow tile and containing a bell, was built in the 1920s. The students were visited by Governor Roland H. Hartley in 1929 and the schoolhouse underwent extensive renovations, including plumbing and the repair of the veranda, in 1937 by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Due to a consolidation of the district with Onalaska, the school ceased being used in 1945. The school building was sold in September 1962 after earlier attempts were hindered for legal reasons. The grounds, listed at 2.65 acres (1.07\u00a0ha), were put up for auction a month later; the land sale was completed for $75.\nInfrastructure\nIn the area that was once the small community of Burnt Ridge is a 2,000 foot (610 metres) runway known as the Burnt Ridge Airstrip (WN74).\nReferences\n^ a b U.S. Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System: Burnt Ridge\n^ a b c \"More WPA Work Being Planned For Lewis County\".

    "Japanese Dominican priest and Zen Buddhist monk\nFather Shigeto Vincent Oshida (Japanese: \u62bc\u7530 \u6210\u4eba; January 15, 1922 \u2013 November 6, 2003) was a Japanese Dominican priest, Zen Buddhist monk, writer, and mystic. Noted for simultaneously being a Dominican friar and Zen Buddhist master, Oshida was known for engaging in interfaith dialogue throughout his life.\nBiography\nShigeto Oshida was born on January 15, 1922, in Namamugi, Yokohama. He was born as the youngest of six children and moved to Shibuya, Tokyo shortly after his birth.\nIn 1942, Oshida graduated from Dai-ichi Kot\u014d Gakk\u014d (\u7b2c\u4e00\u9ad8\u7b49\u5b66\u6821), a two-year preparatory college that was dissolved after World War II. In 1943, he met German Jesuit priest Hermann Heuvers, who became his spiritual mentor. Oshida was baptized in October 1943 and was then drafted into the Japanese Imperial Army in December of that year. After World War II, he attended the University of Tokyo, where he studied philosophy and graduated in 1951. He entered the Order of Preachers (OP), becoming a Dominican friar.\nHe enrolled at the Dominican Theological Seminary in Ottawa, Canada in 1958 and was ordained a priest on 8 April 1961. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, he suffered from lung disease and was frequently hospitalized; part of his right lung was removed in 1963.\nIn 1964, he founded a hermitage called Takamori S\u014dan\u00a0 (Japanese: \u9ad8\u68ee\u8349\u5eb5) in Fujimi Township, Nagano Prefecture in the Japanese Alps. The hermitage consisted of a small community of Christians and Zen Buddhists. From then on, he traveled throughout the world to promote peace and interfaith dialogue. Among his travels, Oshida visited Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Philippines, Saipan, Poland, Lebanon, Israel, Canada, and the United States.\nOn November 6, 2003, Oshida died in Fujimi at the age of 81.\nWritings\nThe following bibliography of writings by Oshida is primarily sourced from Miller (2023).\nAnthologies\nSelected Works of Shigeto Oshida, vol. 1: Encounter with the Depths / \u62bc\u7530\u6210\u4eba\u8457\u4f5c\u9078\u96c61\uff1a\u6df1\u307f\u3068\u306e\u3081\u3050\u308a\u3042\u3044 (2020) (ISBN\u00a09784818410534)\nSelected Works of Shigeto Oshida, vol. 2: Interacting with the Mystical Traditions of the World / \u62bc\u7530\u6210\u4eba\u8457\u4f5c\u9078\u96c62\uff1a\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u795e\u79d8\u4f1d\u627f\u3068\u306e\u4ea4\u308f\u308a (2020) (ISBN\u00a09784818410541)\nSelected Works of Shigeto Oshida, vol. 3: The Resonance of the Current of Life \u2013 The spirituality of the Sub-Current / \u62bc\u7530\u6210\u4eba\u8457\u4f5c\u9078\u96c63\uff1a\u3044\u306e\u3061\u306e\u6d41\u308c\u306e\u3072\u3073\u304d\u3042\u3044 \u5730\u4e0b\u6d41\u306e\u970a\u6027 (2020) (ISBN\u00a09784818410558)\nEnglish writings and lectures\n\"Evangelization and Inculturation.\" Manuscript. 10 pages.\n\"Evangelization and Inculturation\" and \"Zen: The Mystery of the Word and Reality.\" Japan Missionary Bulletin 45 (1991): 153\u201359.

December 18, 1996, Stuttgart; Persian: \u0622\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0647 \u0633\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0648\u06af\u06cc\u0646; Armenian: \u0531\u0576\u0564\u0580\u0565 \u054d\u0587\u0580\u0578\u0582\u056f\u0575\u0561\u0576 ), known as Darvish (Persian: \u062f\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u0634; Armenian: \u0534\u0561\u0580\u057e\u056b\u0577), was a prominent Iranian-Armenian miniature painter of a Georgian descent, and one of the well-known figures in Iranian painting, particularly known for his coffeehouse paintings.\nBiography\nAndr\u00e9 Sevruguin, known as Darvish, was the son of Antoin Sevruguin, a prominent Iranian photographer, and Louise Gourgenian.\nHe completed his education in Tehran, at St. Louis School and later worked as an educator at the same institution. After a period of teaching, he devoted his life to painting.\nFollowing years of work in Iran, Sevruguin moved to Vienna and eventually settled in Germany.\nDarvish spent nine years in seclusion, deeply immersed in the works of Ferdowsi, creating 416 paintings inspired by Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, aligning with the anniversary of the poet's death. When Ferdowsi's millennium was first celebrated in India, Sevruguin's miniatures, published as a nine-volume collection in Iran, were sent to India for an exhibition. Unfortunately, some of these works never returned.\nHis first exhibition brought him fame and caught the attention of several writers and artists of the time. In the 1940s, he had close friendships with many Iranian intellectuals and artists, such as Sadegh Hedayat.\n Andre Sevruguin, Mojtaba Minavi, Gholamhosein MInbashian, Masoud Farzad, and Sadegh Hedayat, near Tehran, circa 1930\nDarvish's style and approach to depicting subjects were distinct from any traditional or contemporary styles of Shahnameh illustrations. He fused the Persian miniature techniques of Safavid-era masters, like Kamal-ud-Din Behzad and Reza Abbasi, with modern painting techniques, producing highly valuable works.\nA year after his first exhibition in Tehran, Darvish traveled to India and organized an exhibition of his works in Calcutta. His works were so well received by the ruler of Hyderabad that he purchased several of them. Buoyed by this material and spiritual encouragement, Darvish returned to Tehran and created additional paintings based on the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and Hafez Shirazi.\nHe held numerous exhibitions in cities such as Vienna, Berlin, Brussels, Paris, and London, achieving success as an Iranian miniaturist and gaining international fame. His works are now housed in various museums worldwide including Tehran Museum of Contemporary art, Museum der Weltkulturen, Armenian Museum in America and National Museum of Armenia.\nAndr\u00e9 Sevruguin passed away in 1996 at the age of one hundred in Stuttgart, Germany.\nSee also\nAntoin Sevruguin\nIranian Georgians\nReferences\nPakbaz, Rouin (1999).

    "Painting by George Jones\nFor the musical work by Beethoven, see Wellington's Victory.\nThe Battle of Vittoria is an 1822 history painting by the British artist George Jones. It depicts the Battle of Vittoria fought in Spain on 21 June 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars. The battle resulted in a decisive victory for Allied forces led by the Duke of Wellington, effectively ending the rule of Napoleon's brother Joseph Bonaparte over Spain. Wellington is shown mounted on a white charger and is directing the final assault towards Vittoria. It is set in the early evening with French troops in disarray while British units including the Hussars, Guards and Rifles are shown in command of the field.\nGeorge Jones was himself a veteran of the Peninsular War and went on to become an established artist and member of the Royal Academy. The work was commissioned by George IV. Jones also produced a companion piece depicting the Battle of Waterloo. These were hung together at St James's Palace in London along with De Loutherbourg's Glorious First of June and The Battle of Trafalgar by Jones' friend Turner. However the king disliked the latter and soon had it shifted to Greenwich Hospital. Both works by Jones remain in the Royal Collection.\nJones' 1827 version of The Battle of Vittoria now at Petworth House.\nJones was later commissioned to produce another version of the Battle of Vittoria by Earl of Egremont, whose son Henry Wyndham had served under Wellington during the campaign. It is now at Petworth House in Sussex.\nReferences\n^ Lloyd p.119\n^ https://www.rct.uk/collection/407186/the-battle-of-vittoria\n^ https://www.rct.uk/collection/407186/the-battle-of-vittoria\n^ Shanes p.166\n^ https://www.rct.uk/collection/407186/the-battle-of-vittoria\n^ https://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/485064\nBibliography\nLloyd, Christopher.

    "\nDelfinbrunnen (1906), Storch's fountain in Maxvorstadt, Munich\n Arthur Josef Ernst Storch (1870\u20131947) was a German sculptor and medallist who worked in porcelain, stone and bronze.\nEarly life\nArthur Storch was born on 22 March 1870 in Volkstedt\u00a0, Rudolstadt, Germany, to a family of Thuringian porcelain artists, including his father Carl Hermann Storch, a modeller and painter, and mother Caroline Florentine, n\u00e9e Leuth\u00e4user. \nHe had a twin brother Hugo and younger siblings Max and Anna.\nCareer\nFrom 1886 to 1888, Storch completed an apprenticeship as a model maker at the porcelain company Triebner, Ens & Eckert. In 1891, he received the \"great silver medal\" of the K\u00f6niglichen Akademie der K\u00fcnste for an exhibition of student work. From 1894 to 1902, he studied under Wilhelm von R\u00fcmann at the Munich Art Academy, where he subsequently worked. From 1902 he worked as a freelance in Munich. Between 1905 and 1907 he provided stucco decoration for the ceilings of the Kurhaus, Wiesbaden.\nIn 1911 he designed a series of eleven medals depicting animals, for the opening of Munich Zoological Garden. The same year he moved to Hamburg, where he became a member of the Hamburger K\u00fcnstlerverein von 1832\u00a0 (Hamburg Artists' Association of 1832). \nRelief of Athena (1914), Hansa-Gymnasium, Hamburg-Bergedorf\nThe Hansa-Gymnasium\u00a0 in Hamburg-Bergedorf has a series of sculptures by Storch, made in 1914. Facade figures below the mansard roof depict four larger-than-life ancient philosophers: Socrates, Demosthenes, Cicero and Ovid. Storch also created a figure of Athena in bas-relief on the pillar at the main entrance, and a fountain with a fox figure. This work was one of several commissions he was given by the municipal architect, Fritz Schumacher.\nHe exhibited four animal figures at the Gro\u00dfe Deutsche Kunstausstellung (Great German Art Exhibition) in Munich in 1937 and 1938. In 1937, Adolf Hitler purchased his bronze sculpture Horse.\nPersonal life\nStorch married Emilie Therese Anna, n\u00e9e M\u00fcller, at Rudolstadt in 1903. Their children were sons Hermann (1899) and Franz (1904) and daughters Elsa (1905) and Lona (1908).\nIn 1917 he moved his family back to Volkstedt.\nDeath and legacy\nStorch died on 9 March 1947 in Rudolstadt and was buried in the cemetery at Volkstedt.\nHis porcelain sculpture Wild Forest Creature (Mandrill Monkey), depicting a Mandrill, was one of a set of sixteen of pieces he made for the Porzellanpalais Leipzig at the 1921 Leipzig Fair; an example is in the Lightner Museum in Florida. Other works are in the Staatsgalerie Moderne Kunst\u00a0 in Munich, Kunsthalle Mannheim, Hamburger Kunsthalle and the Grassi Museum, Leipzig.\nIn 2022, Th\u00fcringer Landesmuseums Heidecksburg held an exhibition of his works, marking the 75th anniversary of his death, and published an accompanying book.\nReferences\n^ Forrer, L.

    "Radio station\nStar Star Broadcasting Station (Chinese: \u661f\u661f\u5ee3\u64ad\u96fb\u81fa, ENIGMA2000: V13), the name also known as Xing Xing, or misidentified as New Star (Chinese: \u65b0\u661f\u5ee3\u64ad\u96fb\u81fa), is a short wave numbers station using upwards of 8000 kHz upper sideband modulation (USB), broadcasting from Taiwan, and is known for the intro of flute playing.\nBelieved to be operated by Taiwan's Military Intelligence Bureau of Ministry of Defence, it is broadcast from the Guanyin station of the Voice of Han Broadcasting of Ministry of Defence, and address to Taiwanese intelligence agents operating within mainland China.\nHistory\nThe history is unknown publicly, however it is still running as of 2024, making it possibly one of the oldest numbers station still active today. In 1995, some reported the station to identify as \"Channel Four Broadcasting Station in Taipei, Republic of China, on 8300 KHz\", while others at the time claimed they never heard such content.\nIn 2002, the station broadcast request for letters or email from listeners, with email address and a postal box number in Taipei provided. One listener reported getting an email reply informing him that the station is called \"Star Star Radio Station\" and even asked him to send his resume. In 2003 two people claimed that they received QSL card from the station but such claim was unable to verify. It is worth mentioning that Taiwanese military units use postal boxes regularly, and Voice of Han do give away QSL cards in the past.\nPrograms\nStar Star Broadcasting Station is broadcast with female Chinese voice. As of now, it has four numbered programs (#1 ~ #4), although there were five of them in 1995. Each program is repeated four times, 30 minute each, for a total of two hours. A different frequency is typically used during the second hour. The broadcast schedule is random that most of the time not transmitting at all.\nMessage format\nThe message is delivered through pairs of four digit numbers, most possibly each pair denoting a Chinese character. A Chinese media reported that they may employ book cipher, that is, a particular book is used as the key, and the first two digits refers to the page number, the third the line number, and the fourth the word count in the line.\nAnother source speculated that the four digit number might refer to the use of Chinese telegraph code. Either way, more encryption methods could be employed to ensure safety.\nContents\nRoutine contents\nStart off with Chinese flute playing, the program usually go as follows:\nNull content\nIt is reported that in rare cases, no message is delivered although the program still runs at the scheduled time. The program goes as follows:\nMedia Appearance\nThe Conet Project (1997, 2013) by Akin Fernandez featured a track recorded from the station, dubbed \"New Star Broadcasting\".\nFootnotes\n^ Due to the similar prononciation of Xin (\u65b0, new) and Xing (\u661f, star) in the broadcast and the secretive nature of numbers station that not many documents could confirm its literal name. However, as seen in a change-of-frequency notice posted by state-owned Radio Taiwan International, the correct usage is Xing Xing (\u661f\u661f).\n^ The unit number is usually a four digit number.\n^ The number of the message is sometimes omitted.\nReference\n^ a b c d e \"Short-Wave Radio Frequency Schedule for XINGXING in ANY LANGUAGE\".

    "American football player\nRick LeLacheur (born 25 August 1948) is a Canadian football executive and former ice hockey player who is the president and chief executive officer (CEO) for the Edmonton Elks of the Canadian Football League (CFL). \nEarly life and hockey career\nAn Edmonton native, LeLacheur was born on 25 August 1948. Playing at the right wing position, he was on the roster for the Edmonton Western Movers of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) for the 1966\u201367 season. LeLacheur then played two seasons for the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Canada Junior Hockey League (WCJHL), later renamed the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). He was the captain for the Oil Kings. LeLacheur's final season playing ice hockey was for the Edmonton Monarchs of the Alberta Senior Hockey League (ASHL) in 1969\u201370.\nExecutive career\nFollowing his hockey career, LeLacheur pursued a business career path, working for his family's Western Moving and Storage business for 25 years. He became Western's president in 1982, serving in the position until the company was sold in 1992.\nIn 1984, before becoming involved with any Canadian Football League (CFL) team, he was the chairman of the Grey Cup festival. He was a board member of the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos in the 1980s. From 1992 to 1998, LeLacheur served as the head of Economic Development Edmonton (EDE), also known as the Edmonton Economic Development Corporation (EEDC). In 1994, LeLacheur brokered a deal that gave Peter Pocklington full control over the Northlands Coliseum.\nLeLacheur became the president and CEO of the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, hosted in Edmonton.\nLeLacheur then served as the team president and CEO of the Eskimos from 2002 to 2011. He began his tenure with the team as the chief operating officer (COO) of the franchise. Edmonton hosted the 90th Grey Cup in 2002, with LeLacheur serving as the game's managing director. During his tenure with the Eskimos, he oversaw new building additions to the team's Commonwealth Stadium. LeLacheur won two Grey Cup championships with the Eskimos, in 2003 and 2005. In 2010, he publicly criticized the team as they started the season 0\u20134. Edmonton would again host Grey Cup festivities in 2010. LeLacheur was named the winner of the Hugh Campbell Distinguished Leadership Award for the 2011 CFL season. He left the team due to health concerns, after experiencing complications stemming from surgery for prostate cancer.\nIn December 2011, he was appointed as the chairman for a three-year term for Horce Racing Alberta (HRA), a private, not-for-profit organization. In December 2017, LeLacheur was named the President and CEO of the CFL's BC Lions. At the time, he was still serving as HRA's chairman of the board. His tenure with the Lions began in January 2018 and ended following the 2022 season. During his tenure with the team, he was tasked with finding new ownership. He was named the Hugh Campbell Distinguished Leadership Award winner for a second time for the 2022 CFL season.\nThough he retired following his Lions tenure, he was lured out of retirement and named the interim president and CEO of the Edmonton Elks on 22 August 2023. This marked his second tenure in those positions with the franchise. During this second tenure, the Elks reviewed their ownership structure; the team has been notably community-owned since 1949, though the Elks have been discussed in Canadian football media as potentially moving toward private ownership. LeLacheur mentioned the team's financial struggles over the few previous seasons as a factor that \"can't be overlooked\".\nIce hockey career statistics\nReferences\n^ a b c d e \"B.C.

    "17th-century fort in Hyderabad, India\nSultan Nagar Fort, also known as Qila-yi Kohna (the Old Fort), are the ruined remains of an abandoned Qutb Shah era fort whose construction had started around 1620. The fort is located at a place now known as L. B. Nagar in Hyderabad, India.\nHistory\nSultan Muhammad Qutb Shah, who had ascended the throne in 1611, wanted to shift the location of his palace and fort far away from Golconda and then Hyderabad which was centred around Charminar, and he started building a new fortress. It is also believed that probably he had intended to shift his capital. The area selected was at Saroornagar which was about 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) east of then Hyderabad. By 1620 work was in full swing for the new fortress which the king named after himself as Sultan Nagar. The king spend about 3 lakh gold coins on constructing the new fort  which was surrounded by a supposedly 75 feet (23\u00a0m) deep and 150 feet (46\u00a0m) wide moat. Sultan Muhammad Quli died suddenly in 1625  leaving behind his wife Hayat Bakshi Begum who was still very young and a toddler Abdullah Qutb Shah who would later become the seventh ruler of Golconda. Hayat Bakshi felt that the sudden death of the king at an age of around 32 years was an ill omen and decided to abandon the construction of the new fort. By then the moat and the masjid were ready and the fortress was nearing completion. Later a new settlement known as Hayathnagar which was named after the Begum was established further to the east.\nPresent\nThe ruins of the fort which once occupied an area of around 5,000 acres (20\u00a0km2) is now also known by some as Maisamma fort. In addition to the mosque built by the Sultan, a temple dedicated to Goddess Maisamma was also later built inside the fort's premises.\nReferences\n^ Shah, Muhammad Quli Qutb; Golkunda, Sultan of. \"Sultan Nagar Fort\".

(Russian: \u0423\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u044f \u0410. \u0413.), also known as Utopiya Alexandra Gradskogo (\u0423\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u044f \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e; transl.\u2009Utopia of Alexander Gradsky), is a 1987 studio album by Russian singer-songwriter Alexander Gradsky.\nBackground and release\nThe music from this album was recorded for the 1978 TV film The Heirs of Prometheus (Russian: \u041d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0435\u044f, romanized:\u00a0Nasledniki Prometeya), dedicated to the utopian socialists Henri de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier and others. It was supposed to be a rock opera in which utopian socialists sing and dance. The theme of socialist utopia did not leave Gradsky, so in 1979, he recorded an album that included poems by Pierre-Jean de B\u00e9ranger, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Robert Burns, which at one time were revolutionary songs.\nThe record Utopiya A. G. did not immediately receive the approval of the Melodiya Art Council. Neither the ideologically correct theme, nor Gradsky's connections, nor the neutral genre of the song suite, nor even the presence of a hammer and sickle on the cover helped her break through. The album was released only in 1987, when sympathy for the ideals of socialism was inappropriate.\nCritical reception\nIn a retrospective review of the Muzykalnaya zhizn\u00a0 magazine, Denis Boyarinov noted that the record, which is an unusual combination of times and epochs, was released at a time when it seemed completely inappropriate, because then people were hungry for change. The reviewer also added that now it resembles a giant majolica made in sound for the glory of socialism, which still pop up in small towns lost in the snows of Russia\u2014sometimes it's the best thing there, shiny fragments of illusion, pure psychedelia.\nTrack listing\nAll music is composed by Alexander Gradsky\nPersonnel\nAlexander Gradsky \u2013 vocals, synthesizer, guitar, piano, celesta, drums, bells, percussion\nVladimir Vasilkov \u2013 percussion\nSergey Zenko \u2013 flute, pipe, saxophone\nSkoromorokhi \u2013 backing band\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\nReferences\n^ Vizilter, Vilen (2015). \u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438 (in Russian).

    "\nHero of the Dominican Restoration War\nCarlos Medrano was a Dominican freedom fighter who fought in the Dominican Restoration War. \nBiography\nDescribed as a selfless and tireless fighter, he joined the Dominican Restoration War upon hearing the shots that rang out in his hometown, Puerto Plata. On August 31, 1863, he arrived in Santiago, which was the scene of an intense battle between the patriots and the annexationists. He had to act in the crucial moments of the siege and after signing the Act of Independence of September 14, 1863, he returned to Puerto Plata to continue fighting.\nHe was a close companion in arms of General Gaspar Polanco. There are war parts shod with their signature, which are dated March 1864, in the camp of Maluis. In October of that year He temporarily served as head of the general camp from Las Jabillas. When Polanco overthrew Jos\u00e9 Antonio Salcedo in October 1864, this was sent under arrest to Puerto Plata, with the supposed purpose of waiting for a ship to arrive at the port of Blanco, (today Luper\u00f3n), to send him to the Turks and Caicos Islands. Who had Salcedo under his responsibility was General Carlos Medrano, and Polanco's secret order arrived to remove the prisoner from confinement, under the false pretext of sending it to Blanco, while the chiefs of custody received the secret order to execute him in the path. The sinister order was fulfilled with the execution of Salcedo, when he died on the afternoon of the 5th November 1864, in the uninhabited cove of Maim\u00f3n, Puerto Plata. When Pimentel headed the uprising of January 1865 from La L\u00ednea, President Polanco sent Medrano to Guayacanes to try to intercept the insurgents. Powerless to resist, Polanco was forced to resign and since Pedro Antonio Pimentel took over, Medrano was one of those arrested and prosecuted for the death of Salcedo. The War Council heard the case and sentenced him to death. Shortly afterward his life was spared. He died thirty years later, in 1895, in the town Hatillo Palma lineman.\nSee also\nPedro Valverde\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Salcedo\nPedro Antonio Pimentel\nReferences\n^ Mej\u00eda, Rafael Chaljub (2007).

    "Annual architecture award for public buildings in Victoria, Australia\nThe William Wardell Award for Public Architecture is the highest honour awarded annually for public buildings in Victoria, Australia and is presented by the Victoria Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) at the Victorian Architecture Awards. It has been awarded 28 consecutive times from 1996 to 2024.\nBackground\nDefinition of the award\nThe award recognises 'completed works of architecture of the highest quality' in the public architecture category. Previously the award was offered for 'institutional buildings' with winning and commended projects including a wider array of building types.\nProjects in this awards category must be predominantly of a public or institutional nature and generally fall within Building Code of Australia (BCA) Class 9, excluding projects within the definition of 'Educational Architecture or any BCA Class 9b building used primarily for educational purposes'. In 1997 the previous institutional awards were recategorised into separate and distinct public, educational and commercial categories.\nA total of 15 of the 24 named awards (62%) presented between 1996 and 2024 were also awarded the top award, the Victorian Architecture Medal at the same awards.\nMultiple winners\nARM Architecture (Ashton Raggatt McDougall) have won the award on five separate occasions: 1996, 2004, 2009, 2015 and 2016.\nNational awards for public architecture\nWinners of this award are eligible for consideration in the annual national Australian Institute of Architects architecture awards for the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, usually announced in October or November. Projects awarded either the Named Award or Architecture Awards in the William Wardell Award can also be considered for the National Award in the same year. To 2023 only three projects from Victoria have gone on to win the national award.\nWilliam Wardell\nThe naming of the award recognises English born architect and civil engineer William Wardell (1823\u20131899). Wardell was appointed government architect in Victoria in 1858. He designed many important public and eccliastical buildings in Melbourne over a 20-year period. After being dismissed by the government Wardell moved to Sydney, extending his career as an influential and important public architect. He died in North Sydney in 1899.\nNamed award winners\nSee also\nArchitecture portalVictoria portalAustralia portal\nAustralian Institute of Architects\nAustralian Institute of Architects Awards and Prizes\nVictorian Architecture Awards\nSir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture\nMaggie Edmond Enduring Architecture Award\nMelbourne Prize\nAustralian Institute of Architects Gold Medal\nReferences\n^ Australian Institute of Architects (November 2020). \"Policy 13 Awards, Prizes and Honours, Section 13.3.5\" (PDF).

It opened on November 29, 2022.\nThe station name of this station is composed of the two names of Wenhanhu Park at the south of the station and the Ji Hua Laboratory in the east as the main and auxiliary station names respectively, excluding punctuation marks. With a total of ten Chinese characters, it has the longest station name of any rail transit station in the Guangzhou-Foshan area at present.\nHistory\nWhen the Nanhai New Transit (now known as Nanhai Tram Line 1) was originally planned, this station was not included. In early 2021, before the construction of the line was about to complete, Nanhai District mentioned that a station called Wenhanhu would be added between Sanshan\u00adxinchengbei and Sanshan\u00adxinchengnan stations when bidding for the initial pre-operation safety assessment project of the line. As the construction of the new station will take longer in the later stage, the initial section of the line opening will also be shortened from Linyuebei to Sanshan\u00adxinchengbei station.\nOn the eve of the opening of the initial section, it was confirmed that the station was renamed Wenhanhu Park Station. On the eve of the opening of the remaining section, the sub-station name of Ji Hua Laboratory was added, making the station name of this station: Wenhanhu Park (Ji Hua Laboratory) station. On November 29, 2022, the station was opened with the opening of the remaining section of Nanhai Tram Line 1.\nStation layout\nThe station has two side platforms on Taishan Road.\nExits\nOther than the 4 exits, an extra passageway to the Ji Hua Laboratory was opened on October 17, 2023.\n\nGallery\nPlatform\nExit A\nExit B (escalator only)\nExit C (escalator only)\nExit D\nReferences\n^ a b \u674e\u4f20\u667a (2022-11-28). \"11\u670829\u65e5\u4e2d\u534812\u65f6\uff01\u5357\u6d77\u6709\u8f68\u7535\u8f661\u53f7\u7ebf\u540e\u901a\u6bb5\u5f00\u901a\" .

    "Boxing match\nKen Norton vs. Larry Holmes was a professional boxing match contested on June 9, 1978, for the WBC heavyweight title.\nBackground\nMultiple-time heavyweight title challenger and number-one ranked contender Ken Norton earned his fourth world title shot after defeating the number-two ranked contender Jimmy Young by a close split decision in a 15-round \"eliminator\" bout on November 15, 1977. Though he was now mandated by the WBC to face Norton in his next defense, then-undisputed heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali had already agreed to face the winner of the Leon Spinks\u2013Alfio Righetti fight that was scheduled on November 18, 1977, only three days after Norton's victory over Young, which Spinks ultimately won. The WBC threatened to strip Ali of their heavyweight title should he go forth with his planned match against Spinks instead of facing Norton, but eventually relented, instead sanctioning the Ali\u2013Spinks fight as long as Ali, the expected winner, agreed to negotiate with Norton and then face him after his expected victory over Spinks. Two weeks after the WBC gave Ali that ultimatum, he officially agreed to a $12 million deal that would see him face Norton for what would be their second world title fight and fourth fight overall. However, these plans were cancelled when Ali shockingly lost to Spinks by split decision on February 15, 1978. Though Spinks was now obligated by the WBC to face Norton, he immediately pursued a rematch with Ali. Norton was given a lowball offer from Spinks' promoter Bob Arum of just $200,000 to accept a fight against Spinks. Though Norton stated he was \"insulted\" by the offer, he chose to accept it, effectively calling Arum and Spinks' bluff, who had hoped he would decline so they could pursue the lucrative rematch with Ali. A week after Norton accepted Spinks' offer, Spinks reneged and officially announced that he would make his first defense against Ali instead. One week after Spinks announced his intentions, WBC president Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n warned that Spinks would be stripped of their title if he did not agree to face Norton by midnight on March 18, 1978. When Spinks reaffirmed that he would still face Ali and not Norton, the WBC voted to strip Spinks of the title and immediately recognize Norton as their heavyweight champion.\nEven before the Spinks\u2013Ali rematch was made official, the WBC had sanctioned an eliminator bout between their number-three ranked contender Earnie Shavers and the number-four ranked contender Larry Holmes. As it was not known at the time who the winner would face, the fight's promoter Don King stated at the time that the winner would get a title shot \"one of these days.\" On March 25, 1978, Holmes defeated Shavers, sweeping every round on two of judge's scorecards and all but one on the third scorecard. With Spinks now out of the WBC's plans by this time, this officially made Holmes the first challenger to Norton's title. The Norton\u2013Holmes fight was somewhat overshadowed by the highly anticipated Spinks\u2013Ali rematch that was scheduled that September, with the New York Times calling the fight \"The Other Title Fight.\" As Norton had not won the title in the ring, he was derided as a \"paper champion\" by some in the media. Norton responded \"How do I feel about being called the paper champion? Well, when you get down to it, it's all on paper anyhow. I said that if I ever became champion I would fight all comers and Larry Holmes is next up. I feel that Holmes is a better fighter than Leon Spinks.\" While Holmes chimed in \"A lot of people ask me about fighting the paper champion, too, but right now Ken Norton is the champion and you have to respect him for that.\"\nNorton entered the fight as a slight 6\u20135 favorite. Holmes, six years Norton's junior, disputed this telling the press \"Norton is too old. I will outbox him. I'm not a devastating puncher, but the fight will not go 15 rounds.\" The fight was broadcast live in the United States by ABC, who estimated that some 40 million people would tune in to watch the fight.\nThe fight\nIn an extremely close fight that went the full 15 rounds, Holmes earned a razor-thin split decision victory as two judge's scored the fight in his favor 143\u2013142 while the third judge scored the fight the same in favor of Norton. Holmes got off to a quick start winning four of the first five rounds as he served as the aggressor while Norton took a more defense and tactical approach. As the sixth round began, Norton abandoned his defensive approach and began to dominate Holmes as he continuously advanced forward and landed punches on Holmes often, winning five of the next six rounds after his slow start whilst also opening a cut inside Holmes lip in the eight. With both fighters starting to tire, Holmes got back on track taking both the 12th and 13th rounds, staggering Norton twice in the latter. Norton then took the penultimate 14th round, staggering Holmes twice and landing a six punch combination just before the round ended. The two fight",

    "Guy XV de Laval, born Fran\u00e7ois de Laval-Montfort, (1435\u20131501) was a noble, military officer, and Grand Master of the Kingdom of France in 1483.\nFamily\nGuy was the son of Count Guy XIV of Laval and Isabella of Brittany.  Through his mother, he was the great-grandson of both Joan of Navarre and King Charles VI of France.\nBiography\nChildhood and Betrothal\nGuy was baptized under the name of Fran\u00e7ois by the Bishop of Rennes, Guillaume Brillet.\nWhen he was six years old, he was betrothed to the heiress, Fran\u00e7oise de Dinan. She was at the same time sought after by Arthur de Montauban and by Gilles of Brittany, brother of Duke Francis I of Brittany.\nIn 1444, Fran\u00e7oise de Dinan was abducted and forced to marry Gilles of Brittany, with the aid of his brother Francis I, Fran\u00e7oise's mother, Catherine de Rohan, and even Guy XIV  who, in exchange for the promise of 20,000 crowns had renounced the rights of his son.\nAnother of her suitors, Arthur de Montauban was disheartened, and hatched a plot against Gilles, who was imprisoned by his brother the Duke, and killed in 1450.\nThe Duchess of Brittany refused to abandon her sister-in-law to Arthur de Montauban, instead remarrying her to Guy XIV de Laval, who gave up the promised sum of 20,000 crowns in exchange.\nGuy was raised with the Dauphin Louis, son of King Charles VII, and was an intimate friend of his.\nMilitary career\nIn 1453, Guy accompanied the King on the Guyenne expedition and attended the second siege of Bordeaux.\nIn 1465, Guy sided with King Louis XI in the feudal conflict that was the War of the Public Weal against the Duchy of Brittany and Charles the Bold.\nRoyal Honours\nLouis XI appointed Guy as Captain of Melun in 1466, and allowed him to quarter his arms with those of France.\nGuy, with his brother Pierre de Laval, attended the Estates General in 1466, as Count of G\u00e2vres. They were made Princes equal in rank to the Princes of Blood in 1467. Guy was also invested as Count of Montfort-sur-Risle at sometime between 1466 and 1468.\nCount of Montfort and Laval\nOn the death of Charles IV of Anjou, the last member of the House of Valois-Anjou, in 1481, Maine reverted to the King, and Laval was erected as a County held directly under the King.\nGuy often lived at the Ch\u00e2teau de Laval when not at court, Guy XIV, his father, lived in Brittany since his second marriage, and dwelt at Ch\u00e2teaubriant, his wife's main estate. He also lost the county of Montfort around this time, complaining bitterly to  King Charles VIII about it.\nGuy de Laval was fifty years old when his father died in 1486, taking the title of Count of Laval as Guy XV.\nService under Charles VIII\nCharles VIII was at the Ch\u00e2teau de Laval in May 1487, spending a fairly long time there.\nCharles VIII gave, in 1488, to Count Guy, the government of the city of Dreux and conferred on him the vacant office of Grand Master of France. These were rewards for his loyalty in the Mad War against Brittany.\nDevotion and Piety\nGuy XV of Laval demonstrated his Piety in these ways:\nHe constructed the Church of Saint V\u00e9n\u00e9rand in Laval\nHe sold land to the Jacobin Convent of Laval\nGuy possessed a singular devotion to Saint Francis and made in 1494, a nunnery, for the Franciscan nuns that followed the rule of Urban IV.\nSuccession and Death\nGuy XV de Laval did not fulfill the functions of his office or attend the coronation of Louis XII on 27 May 1498, due to his infirmities.\nIn the same year, Guy inherited the barony of Acquigny from his sister Jeanne de Laval, widow of Rene of Anjou, who had just died.\nIn 1499, Guy suffered a paralytic attack that left him  physically and mentally crippled.\nGuy's only son had died young and the succession fell to his nephew, Nicholas de Laval, Lord of La Roche-Bernard.\nGuy died at the Ch\u00e2teau de Laval on 28 January 1501.\nTitles\nGuy XV de Laval had several titles. Here is a list of them:\nCount of Laval, Baron of Vitr\u00e9, Viscount of Rennes, Count of Caserta, Baron of Laz, Baron of Acquigny, and of Cr\u00e8vec\u0153r, of Loh\u00e9ac, Count of Montfort in Brittany, Baron of Ga\u00ebl, Lord of Tint\u00e9niac, of B\u00e9cherel and of Romill\u00e9, of Br\u00e9al,  Montreuil-Bellay, Saosnois, La Guerche, Gournay and of Noyelles-sur-Mer.\nReferences\n^ a b c d Arthur Bertrand de Broussillon , The House of Laval (1020-1605).

    "Road in Kenya\nThe A10 road is a road in Kenya stretching a diagonal trajectory from Lokichar in the northwest to the port city of Lamu in the southeast, covering a planned distance of 970 kilometers. Currently, the route is in various stages of development, with certain sections yet to be constructed. As a key development axis, the A10 has the potential to play a role in connecting disparate regions and fostering economic growth. However, its full realization requires further infrastructure development to complete the envisioned route.\nRoute\nThe A10 is a proposed upgrade to a network of road connections, which, as of 2020, consisted largely of underdeveloped dirt roads, with several sections missing and others merely consisting of desert tracks. Only limited portions had been paved, including a short stretch from Isiolo and a section between Kinyang and Loruk. The envisioned route will span from the A1 near Lokichar, traversing the Rift Valley and northern Kenya's deserts, to the coastal town of Lamu on the Indian Ocean. Notably, the route intersects with the A2 at Isiolo, a critical juncture, and crosses the A3 at Garissa. The terminus in Lamu also marks the endpoint of the A7 coastal road, highlighting the A10's potential as a vital link in Kenya's transportation infrastructure.\nHistory\nLamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor\nThe A10 road is being developed as part of the Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor (LAPSSET) project, a comprehensive initiative aimed at enhancing regional connectivity. Although initial feasibility studies date back to 1975, it wasn't until 2008 that a detailed study was undertaken to develop a new deep-sea port in Lamu and establish a transport corridor linking Kenya to Sudan, with the scope later expanded to include the newly independent nation of South Sudan. The project seeks to foster economic growth and facilitate trade across the region.\nThe project includes several elements:\nAn oil refinery in Lamu\nThree airports\nThree resort towns: Lamu, Isiola and Lake Turkana\nA deep-sea port in Manda Bay, called Lamu Port\nA railway line from Lamu to Juba (South Sudan) and Addis Ababa (Ethiopia)\nA road network\nAn oil pipeline\nConstruction of a paved road\nThe majority of the A10 route currently consists of unpaved dirt roads, dirt paths, and sandy tracks. However, some limited progress has been made in upgrading the road. Around 2012, a brief 4-kilometer stretch was paved, connecting the A2 highway in Isiolo to the east. Nevertheless, as of 2021, further development of this project had not commenced. Additionally, a 30-kilometer section between Nginyang and Loruk, formerly designated as the B4, was asphalted around 2017, marking a minor improvement in the road's overall condition. Despite these incremental upgrades, the route remains largely underdeveloped.\nRoad number history\nIn 2016, the A10 designation was introduced as part of a comprehensive renumbering effort. This new classification encompassed a combination of existing roads and proposed connections, some of which were still in the planning stages or under construction at the time. The A10 route was thereby established, incorporating a mix of already-built infrastructure and envisioned links, with the aim of creating a cohesive and interconnected transportation network.\nThe A10 was routed over the following roads:\nC113: Lokori - Kinyang\nC46: Lokichar - Lokori\nB4: Kinyang - Loruk\nmissing corridor: Kubi Turkana - north of Garissa\nC81: north of Garissa - Garissa\nmissing corridor: Garissa - Ijara\nD568: Ijara - Hindi\nC112: Hindi - Lamu\nD370: Loruk - Mugle Ranch\nMissing corridor: Mugle Ranch - Isiolo\nB9: Isiolo - Kubi Turkana\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Kenya Roads Board\".

    "Settlement in Crimea, Ukraine\nUrban-type settlement in Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Ukraine\nLomonosove (Ukrainian: \u041b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435; Crimean Tatar: Lomonosovo; Russian: \u041b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432o) is a village (selo) in the Bilohirsk Raion, Autonomous Republic of Crimea, southern Ukraine, which is currently occupied and annexed by the Russian Federation. Despite Ukraine's administrative reform in 2020, Russia continues to administer the settlement as part of the Nyzhnohirskyi Raion. As of the 2001 Ukrainian Census, Lomonosove counted a population of 747 inhabitants.\nHistory\nUnder the Soviet Union\nDuring World War II, the settlement came under German occupation. The local Jewish population was either forced to flee, or massacred by the invading forces. After the end of the war and the ethnic cleansing of the local Jewish and Crimean Tatar population by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union respectively, Lomonosove was settled by Ukrainians and Russian working immigrants from the Tambov Oblast.\nIn independent Ukraine\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the local Crimean Tatar population of Lomonosove saw rapid growth, as most of the surviving population returned to Crimea.\nIn 2014, in violation of international law, Russia invaded and occupied Crimea. After conducting what was vastly considered to be a sham referendum, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea was incorporated by Russian Federation as the Republic of Crimea.\nGeography\nLomonosove is located on the right bank of the Salhyr river in the eastern part of the Crimean peninsula. The village features a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen classification Dfa), which borders on a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen classification Cfa). Summers are hot, while winters are cool and dry. Cold snaps are not uncommon due to the absence of high mountains, which would protect the area from cold air coming from the north.\nDemographics\nAs of the 2001 Ukrainian census, the settlement had a population of 747. The majority of the population is ethnic Ukrainian, while Crimean Tatars and Russians make up the largest minorities in the settlement. Lomonosove is lingualistically diverse, with most of the population being Ukrainophone.\nThe exact native language composition was as follows:\nReferences\n^ \"\u0420\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0456 \u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0432 \u043e\u0431'\u0454\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0445 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438\". socialdata.org.ua.\n^ \"\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c\u0443\". ccssu.crimea.ua.\n^ \"\u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c (1944\u20131976)\". cyberleninka.ru.\n^ \"Crimea's referendum was a sham display of democracy\".

He played his first professional game with Carta Blanca against the Cafeteros de C\u00f3rdoba. \"La Mala,\" nicknamed for his similar playing style to Salvador Malacara, won the 1939 Mexican League Rookie of the Year Award.\nIn 1943, L\u00e1zaro Salazar was appointed manager of the Industriales de Monterrey (the team changed its name from Carta Blanca to Industriales in 1942). With Salazar, Monterrey won four Mexican League championships in 1943, 1947, 1948 and 1949; Torres was a key player for the team as the first bat for the Industriales, later known as Sultanes since 1948.\nHe played in the Cuban League for the Tigres de Marianao during the 1943\u201344 season. In 183 at bats he recorded 27 runs, 49 hits, 14 RBIs and an average of .268.\nOn 12 September 1947, Torres achieved his 1000th career hit in a game against the Diablos Rojos del M\u00e9xico at Parque Delta, becoming the first player to do so in the history of the Mexican League. Torres' teammate, Agust\u00edn Bejerano, had 999 hits while La Mala was three hits short of the thousand mark. Bejerano was the favorite; however, Torres batted three hits against M\u00e9xico's pitcher Fred Martin, achieving the feat.\nIn 1955, while still a player, he  was appointed as manager of the Sultanes after the departure of L\u00e1zaro Salazar. He finished fifth in 1995 and 1956. In 1957 he was transferred to the Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo. He also played for the San Antonio Missions during the 1957 Texas League. Torres retired after the 1957 season.\nTorres died on 21 April 1971 in Monterrey due to complications from lung cancer, aged 49.\nLegacy\nTorres was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame as part of the class of 1964, alongside \u00c1ngel Castro, Mart\u00edn Dihigo, L\u00e1zaro Salazar, Ram\u00f3n Braga\u00f1a and Genaro Casas.\nHis two sons, H\u00e9ctor and Ricardo, were also baseball players. H\u00e9ctor, nicknamed \"La Malita\" in honor of his father, played in Major League Baseball for nine seasons between 1968 and 1977, with the Houston Astros, Chicago Cubs, Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres and Toronto Blue Jays. Ricardo played from 1967 to 1971 in the Mexican League with Monterrey and Alijadores de Tampico.\nOn 16 May 1994, the Sultanes de Monterrey officially retired Torres' number 7. Venados de Mazatl\u00e1n also retired Torres' number 7.\nCareer statistics\nCuban League\nSource:\nManagerial statistics\nMexican League\nReferences\n^ \"Epitacio La Mala Torres el hombre del brazo de oro\".

    "\nEdrica Huws (born 12 January 1907) was a textile artist. Her father, Thomas Tyrwhitt, was an architect who also worked with watercolors and engravings. She is also the mother of Welsh historian Daniel Huws.\nEarly Life\nBorn in London, and attending St. Pauls Girls' School, she eventually married Welsh draftsman and architect, Richard Huws in 1931, before moving to Talwrn, a village on the Isle of Anglesey, to raise their four children.\nAdulthood\nEdrica Huws trained as an artist at the Chelsea School of Art and earned an ARCA diploma at the Royal College of Art in London, developing her own technique for creating art works using fibre patchwork. Although Edrica stopped producing patchwork art to concentrate on raising her children, she collected pieces of fabric over the years, to be used when she could return to her practice.\nBefore returning to fibre patchwork, Edrica wrote poetry, with multiple pieces being published in popular magazines of the time, such as, The Times Literary Supplement and The Listner.\nAchievements\nAfter completing studies at the Royal College of Art, Edrica was commissioned to paint a series of panels inside the building of St. Mary's Church in South Benfleet.\nEdrica was 51 when she began her first large patchwork of a greenhouse which took a year to produce. She eventually was able to complete an average sized patchwork in about a month.\nFollowing the death of her husband she moved to Paris and continued to work into her 70s and 80s. In 1982, she had her first exhibition at the Le Bleu du Ciel gallery in V\u00e9lzelay, France. Also in 1982, a bilingual Japanese/English book of her artwork, Edrica Huws: Patchwork Pictures, was published. Edrica's first exhibition at Ginza Shiseido gallery in Tokyo followed a year later. This resulted in Edrica becoming a household name in the respective countries.\nA collection of poems written between 1943 and 1953, were published in a booklet, Poems, printed in 1994 by Embers Handpress, Rhiwargor.\nIn 1998, two of Edrica's patchworks were requested by special invitation for exhibition of the World Quilting Festival in Tokyo. This brought Edrica's work to the attention of the global quilting community, especially in America.\nDeath and Influence\nEdrica died on 10 June 1999, aged 91, and was buried alongside her husband Richard at Llanddyfnan Churchyard.\nEdrica Huws\u2019 family organised an exhibition of her work in Anglesey in 2007, using prints and cards to help raise funds for the National Eisteddfod.\nEdrica's total amount of completed artworks was 187, over 60 are in Japan, over 50 are in France, with the rest in the United Kingdom.\nReferences\n^ a b c d Greer, Germaine (August 13, 2007). \"Making pictures from strips of cloth isn't art at all - but it mocks art's pretentions to the core\".

    "In Greek mythology, Anatole (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7, romanized:\u00a0Anatol\u00ea, lit.\u2009'rising') was the second Hora (Hour) who presided over the hour of dawn. She was also called Anatolia or Antolia (\u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03b7 means \u2018eastern\u2019).\nFamily\nAnatolia was sister of the other eleven Hora: Auge (First Light), Musica (Hour of Music), Gymnastica (Hour of Exercise), Nymphe (Hour of Bath), Mesembria (Noon), Sponde (Libation), Elete (Hour of Prayer), Acte (Hour of Pleasure), Hesperis (Evening), Dysis (Sunset) and Arctus (Night Sky).\nTheir father was either Helios (Sun) or Chronos (Time).\nMythology\nAntolia along with her sisters, Dysis, Mesembria and Arktos were the attendants of the goddess Harmonia (Harmony) within her halls in heaven. Like the rest of her siblings, she attended one of the four gates of the Winds.\n\u201cWith hurrying shoe, she (i.e. Aphrodite) whizzed along the vault of heaven to the hall of Allmother Harmonia, where that nymph dwelt in a house, self-built, shaped like the great universe with its four quarters joined in one. Four portals were about that stronghold standing proof against the four winds. Handmaids protected this dwelling on all sides, a round image of the universe: the doors were allotted \u2014 Antolia was the maid who attended the East Wind's gate; at the West Wind's was Dysis the nurse of Selene; Mesembrias held the bolt of the fiery South; Arktos the Bear was the servant who opened the gate of the North, thick with clouds and sprinkled with hail. To that place went Charis, fellow-voyager with the Foamborn (i.e. Aphrodite), and running ahead she knocked at the eastern gate of Euros. As the rap came on the saffron portal of Antolia, Astynomeia an attendant ran up from within; and when she saw Cypris (i.e. Aphrodite) standing in front of the gatehouse of the dwelling, she went with returning feet to inform her mistress beforehand. \u201d\n\u2014\u200aNonnus, Dionysiaca 41.275-293\nReferences\n^ see Hyginus, Fabulae 183 where her name is missing\n^ a b Nonnus, 41.283 & 290\n^ Hyginus, Fabulae 183\n^ Nonnus, 41.287\n^ Quintus Smyrnaeus, 2.502\n^ Nonnus, 12.15\nvte\n",
    "\nMotel in Mississippi, United States\nThe Sun-n-Sand Motor Hotel was a motel in Jackson, Mississippi, United States. The motel was opened in 1960 and partially demolished in 2021.\nThe motel was opened by Mississippi businessman Dumas Milner and was designed in either the International or mid-century modern style. Due to its close proximity to the Mississippi State Capitol, the motel served as the temporary lodging for many politicians and elected officials while the Mississippi Legislature was in session. Additionally, during the 1960s, it became a prominent lodging location for activists in the civil rights movement, such as Robert L. Carter of the NAACP and several members of the Council of Federated Organizations during the Freedom Summer project.\nIn either 2001 or 2002, the motel closed. Following this, the government of Mississippi began to lease the property as a parking lot for government employees. In 2019, the government purchased the property and announced plans to demolish the building and convert the lot into additional parking spaces. This prompted outcry from many state historians and led to the motel being declared a Mississippi Landmark by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History and being added to the National Trust for Historic Preservation's list of America's Most Endangered Places in 2020. Despite this, much of the structure was demolished by February 2021, with only the sign and some of the commons areas preserved, with the intent of converting the latter into office and meeting spaces.\nArchitecture\nSources differ slightly on the architectural style of the motel. In a 2019 article in the Jackson Free Press, the motel is described as \"a rare example of International-style modernism in Jackson\", though a 2021 analysis of the building by the National Trust for Historic Preservation describes it as an example of mid-century modern architecture, with distinctive elements including large plate glass windows and metal screens. The motel had a ballroom, a swimming pool, and a sign that was constructed in either the mid-century modern or Googie style. The total floor area of the building, including the commons areas, was at least  60,000 square feet (5,600\u00a0m2).\nHistory\nThe Sun-n-Sand Motor Hotel, located at 401 North Lamar Street, was opened in 1960 by Dumas Milner, a Mississippi businessman, who named the motel after another one that he owned in Biloxi, Mississippi. In addition to the Sun-n-Sand properties, Milner also owned and operated the King Edward Hotel in Jackson. In 1965, the motel opened one of the first bars in Jackson after prohibition was repealed in the city. According to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the motel was \"a fixture of downtown Jackson\", and it is referenced in several works of literature that are set in the city, including Willie Morris's My Cat, Spit McGee and Kathryn Stockett's The Help. Additionally, Morris wrote his book New York Days while staying at the motel, and John Grisham, who was at the time a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives, wrote A Time to Kill while living in the motel.\nUse by legislators and activists\nMany state legislators stayed at the motel during legislative sessions due to its proximity to the Mississippi State Capitol (pictured 2008).\nLocated near the Mississippi State Capitol, the new motel became notable for housing several members of the Mississippi Legislature during legislative sessions. Legislators could rent rooms at the motel on a monthly basis, and, according to journalist Keisha Rowe of The Clarion-Ledger, it served as an \"informal meeting site\" where elected officials could discuss political matters. Concerning a 1984 meeting at the hotel with politicians William J. McCoy and Michael P. Mills, journalist Sid Salter of the Clarion-Ledger said that the living arrangements at the motel were similar to those of the freshman dormitories at Mississippi State University and that the politicians who stayed there operated under the Chatham House Rule. In 2001, McCoy said concerning the political activities at the motel, \"We have passed many important measures because of our conversations after hours in the Sun-n-Sand\". Representative Steve Holland similarly noted the significance of the motel in Mississippi politics during a 2009 interview with the Associated Press, saying, \"Everything you ever needed to know about what's going on, you could find out at the breakfast table. ... Hell, if you didn't know it, you could start a rumor at 5:30 in the morning. It'd be around the Capitol later that day\".\nIn addition to legislators, many activists in the civil rights movement used the motel while staying in Jackson, such as Robert L. Carter of the NAACP, who stayed at the hotel in 1964. In July of that year, following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the motel became one of several in Jackson to desegregate and accept African American patrons. On August 15 of that year, Ku Klux Klan members held a cro",
    "Armed Forces Radio and Television Service Keflavik or AFRTS Keflavik (formerly Radio TFK) or Kana\u00fatvarpi\u00f0/Kanatv\u00ed\u00f0ur or Keflav\u00edkurtv\u00ed\u00f0ur, as it was commonly called by Icelanders, was the radio station of the Armed Forces at the Naval Air Station Keflav\u00edk station in Su\u00f0urnes, which operated from 1951 to 2006 when the military base was closed.\nThe station's defined mission was to send out entertainment to uplift soldiers and military personnel at the military bases in Iceland. The program of the station was based primarily on popular American radio and television content, but part of the program was special informational programs produced by the Pentagon, which seemed to have some propaganda undertones. The station also produced its own content, mainly news and weather reports. The station was part of the Armed Forces Network radio network that operates on US military bases around the world. The operator of the station was the Navy Media Center (NMC) Broadcasting Detachment in Keflav\u00edk, but most of the content was obtained from AFRTS, which was in charge of purchasing and producing content.\nWhen the station was closed in September 2006, 25 people worked there, including three Icelandic technicians.\nRadio broadcasts\nThe station began broadcasting on medium wave with a power of 25 watts in November 1951 and then received permission from the Icelandic government to operate a radio station 24 hours a day in May 1952. At the same time, the power was increased to 250 watts and the station was always one of the most powerful in a large area around Iceland. Previously, the US Army had operated a radio station at Keflav\u00edk Airport during the Second World War. The radio station broadcast continuously from 1952 to 2006.\nTelevision broadcasts\nOn February 15, 1954, the station applied for a license for a television station, in order to keep the servicemen on the installation. It then received the license for television broadcasting on March 4, 1955 (some sources believe the license was received on March 1),:\u200a83\u200a with regular broadcasts starting on March 17. It was broadcast on the frequency 108-186 Hz in a 345\u00b0 beam. Due to differences between frequencies and standards, Icelanders either modified their sets or received the television station via its FM signal. These were the first television broadcasts from Iceland, eleven years before R\u00daV began broadcasting. The license was subject to the conditions that the power of the broadcast was limited to 50 watts and an attempt was made to direct the beam to the station itself. Because the case was not considered to affect Icelandic interests, Minister of Foreign Affairs Kristinn Gu\u00f0mundsson did not bring the case before Al\u00feingi.\nIt soon became clear that the TV signal from the station was received in Su\u00f0urnes, Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur and Reykjav\u00edk, and various people got hold of TV receivers and TV antennas to be able to follow the station's program. Reykjav\u00edk was just 56 kilometers (35 miles) away from Keflav\u00edk and was able to receive the signal well. The receivers were expensive and therefore few households could afford such a luxury, but the viewing has probably been greater than the number of devices indicated due to group viewing of popular programs. By 1960, the transmitter's power increased, enabling a larger reach and concerns about an American cultural invasion in the coverage area.\nThe dispute over Keflav\u00edk television\nIn 1959, two members of the People's Alliance presented a proposal to close the television station, but it was not accepted. On March 13, 1961, the station applied for the broadcasting power to be increased from 50w to 250w, and that permission was granted on April 17. When the station increased its broadcast grant the following year, the issue came up again in Al\u00feingi. The MP from the Progressive Party then criticized that the Minister of Foreign Affairs had given a foreign television station a de facto monopoly on television broadcasting in Iceland. The issue was even more painful as Icelandic television had not yet been established despite discussions about its necessity for almost a decade. The Danish National Broadcasting Company had started television broadcasting in 1951.\nThe controversy flared up after this, and on March 13, 1964, sixty well-known Icelanders published an article calling on the Icelandic government to limit the station's broadcasts, so that \"the issue  can be developed in accordance with the will and capacity of the people, without undue coercion\". Opponents of the station were, among other things, worried that Icelandic youth would be exposed to \"unwanted\" cultural influences and even lose the Icelandic language. However, many people came to the defense of Keflav\u00edk TV, and over 14,000 people signed a petition requesting that the station be allowed to continue broadcasting in Iceland. Theoretically, for the development of national television in Iceland, it was more nationalistic to \"watch Vikings killing each other than cowboys killing Indian",
    "Former heat and power generating plant\nThe Friedrichshain combined heat and power plant is also is located at R\u00fcdersdorfer Stra\u00dfe in the district Berlin-Friedrichshain. Today the building is widely known as the location of the techno club Berghain. The conversion from cogeneration plant to nightclub took place in 2003/04 and was supervised by the design firm Studio Karhard \u2013 led by architects Alexandra Erhard and Thomas Karsten.\nUrban context\nThe planning and construction of the thermal power station are part of Berlin's reconstruction after World War II. One of the major GDR prestige projects in the 1950s was the construction of an exemplary public housing estate in Berlin-Friedrichshain. This project included buildings on Stalinallee (now Karl-Marx-Allee), the Weberwiese high-rise building, the Deutsche Sporthalle arena, a school on R\u00fcdersdorfer Stra\u00dfe (now Ellen-Key-School), a police and fire station, and a combined heat and power station. Architect Thomas Karsten: \"It was the heating plant that initially supplied the buildings with heat and later with electricity.\"\nCoal loading bridge and chimneys at the time of the power generation; on the left of the picture the cooling tower can be seen through the steel lattice of the coal loading bridge\nThe district heating network in East Berlin was not sufficiently developed to supply the large residential area. For this reason, a new district heating plant was specially built in Friedrichshain. From the outset, it was planned to first implement the heating function in 1952, and then to add electricity generation in a second step in 1954. \"The heating plant was built with the apartment block development in the style of Socialist Classicism along Karl-Marx-Allee, which was still called Stalinallee at the time of construction. Not only electricity, but above all heat was needed for the modern heating of the new residential and representative buildings.\"\nThe original site of the plant stretched from the power plant building eastwards towards Helsingforser Stra\u00dfe and Marchlewskistra\u00dfe. This was where the coal loading bridge and coal stockpiles were located, among other things. A remaining structure on the former power station's plot is the former locomotive shed, which is now used by the neighbourhood organisation Nirgendwo. Other buildings on the site include the low-rise buildings on the western edge of the property. At the northern corner of the property there is a row with no public use. At the western corner of the property is the so-called canteen (Kantine am Berghain), which is used for live concerts and parties. The area between the canteen and the main building is now used as beer gaden under the name Bierhof R\u00fcdersdorf. The concrete structure, which is now used for the bar and terrace of the beer garden, originally housed a district heating transfer station.\nConstruction phases\nStructural concrete inside the former boiler house, now Halle am Berghain\nThe official construction period is 1952\u20131955. \"Built in two phases, the building was made out of two \u2018cubes\u2019 of 40 x 40 metres.\" First, a boiler house was completed, which served as a district heating plant. Then, directly after that, the turbine and generator house was built, which then served as the electricity supply. The first construction phase also included two \u2013 now demolished \u2013 chimneys that connected to the east side of the boiler house. Immediately after the completion of the boiler house, construction began on the turbine and generator house. In 1955, this addition was complete and a cooling tower in the shape of a circular hyperboloid was erected.\nThe first construction phase was the boiler house. The boiler house is now used for art exhibitions as a Halle am Berghain. The southern half of the boiler house ground floor is occupied by the queer sex club Lab.oratory.

    "American diving coach (born 1951)\nVince Panzano is an American former competition diver for Ohio State University, who coached the Ohio State University diving team for thirty-five years from 1978 through 2013. Panzano was a ten-time Big 10 and four-time NCAA Diving Coach of the Year who coached teams that won six national titles. Well recognized on the international stage, he served as an Olympic diving coach in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and most recently the 2012 London Olympics.\nEducation\nPanzano was born in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where he attended nearby Upper Merion High School, and as a multi-sport athlete competed as a diver on the swim team and was a high-jumper and pole-vaulter on the track team. In March, 1967 at the Pennsylvania State Championships at the Bucknell Pool in Lewisburg, he placed fifth overall, a solid performance for a High School underclassman. In March, 1968 Panzano placed third diving in the Pennsylvania Boy's High School State Championship in Lewisburg, Pennsylania.\nHe attended Ohio State from 1969 to 1973, where he dove competitively for Coach Ron O'Brien.  In his Senior year, he helped O'Brien coach the diving team.  During college, Panzano gained additional coaching experience from working at summer camps including the Ron O'Brien Diving School in Columbus, Ohio.\nCoaching\nTennessee\nPanzano coached diving at the University of Tennessee from 1973 through 1978 immediately after graduating Ohio State, replacing former diving coach Bill Ferry. In his first summer at Tennessee in 1973, he worked as a coach at their All-sports camp in June. At Tennessee, Panzano was mentored by Hall of Fame Head Swim Coach Ray Bussard, and his teams produced at least one Southeastern Conference Champion in each of the five years he coached.  As an indication of his improvement as a young coach, and the regional recognition of his diving program, he was named SEC Diving Coach of the Year in 1977 after only four years coaching Tennessee.  Panzano acknowledged how his skills had grown under Bussard, noting, \"I've learned what coaching is about through him\".\nOhio State\nHe was hired to coach at Ohio State University in 1978 where he remained through his retirement on August 5, 2013. His thirty-five years of service was the longest tenured coaching position at Ohio State at that time.   During his lengthy coaching career he excelled on the national stage and led Ohio State and McDonald's Diving, an age group team, to six national team titles.  Demonstrating the excellence of his program at Ohio State, he developed two Olympic medalists, 13 NCAA champions, 23 U.S. national diving champions and 59 Big Ten champions. He also coached an exceptional 92 All-Americans.\nOutstanding Ohio State divers coached by Panzano include 1996, and 2000 Olympian David Pichler, 1988 and 1996 Olympian Patrick Jeffrey, Laura Profumo, Kim Fugett, Carrier Finneran, 1976 Olympian Kent Vosler, who coached diving, 1992 Olympian and Ithaca College diving coach Karen LaFace, 1984 and 1988 Olympic silver and bronze medalist and coach Kelly McCormick, and 1988 Olympian Mark Bradshaw , who has served as the diving coach at Arizona State University.\nService to the diving community\nAside from coaching, Panzano directed the meet for the 1976 Olympic trials. In 1980, he helped host the first diving meet of America against China at his alma mater, Ohio State.  The following year he helped host the U.S. Diving Championships at Ohio State. He worked with the Board of Directors of United States Diving, and the United States Diving International/Olympic Committee.  A prestigious and important post, he also served with the NCAA Swimming and Diving Rules Committee.\nHonors\nTo recognize him as U.S. Diving's outstanding coach, Panzano has been awarded the \u201cMike Peppe Award,\u201d on two occasions.  Peppe was one of Ohio State's longest serving, and most distinguished swimming coaches.  A prestigious honor due to its national scope, he was also chosen four times as the NCAA Diving Coach of the Year. In 1996, Panzano was inducted into Ohio State University's Athletics Hall of Fame.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e \"Vince Panzano to Retire as Head Coach of Diving Team \u2013 Ohio State Buckeyes\".\n^ \"Vince Panzano Steps Down After 30 Years\". swimswam.com.\n^ a b \"Ohio State Grad Vince Panzano\", The Knoxville News-Sentinel, Knoxville, Tennessee, 27 May 1973, pg. 54\n^ \"Baldwin Brother Act Set New Swim Records\", The Evening Standard, 6 March 1967, pg. 16\n^ \"Three District Swimmers Place in State Competition\", The Morning Call, Allentown, Pennsylvania, 3 March 1968, pg. 51\n^ \"Vols Employ Diving Coach\", The Tennessean, Nashville, Tennessee, 27 May 1973, pg. 45\n^ \"Panzano UT Diving Coach\", Kingsport Times News, Kingsport, Tennessee, 27 May 1973, pg. 27\n^ Julian, Roland, \"Panzano Takes OSU Job\", The Knoxville News-Sentinel, 13 February 1978, pg. 18\nExternal links\nVince Panzano to Retire as Head of Ohio State Diving Team",

    "Sahel Alma or Sahel Aalma is a Late Cretaceous paleontological site and Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte in Keserwan-Jbeil, Lebanon. Located near the town of the same name, it documents well-preserved deepwater marine fossils dating to the late Santonian stage of the Cretaceous. It is often associated with the slightly older, similarly famous Sannine Formation sites (Haqel, Hadjula, and Nammoura), with these four sites being together referred to as the \"Fish Beds\" of Lebanon.\nIt is one of the few fossiliferous units of the Chekka Formation, a wider geological formation in Lebanon deposited from the Late Cretaceous to the early Paleogene.\nDescription\nMuch like the fossil sites of the older Sannine Formation, Sahel Alma contains exquisitely preserved marine fossils from the Tethys Ocean, deposited off the northern coast of the Afro-Arabian continent. However, unlike the Sannine Formation sites, which were deposited in relatively shallow waters near the shore on the inner continental shelf, Sahel Alma was deposited in a deepwater habitat off the continental slope, at depths estimated to be greater than 150 metres (490\u00a0ft), likely at the transition between the sublittoral and bathyal zones in dysphotic or aphotic conditions. This has caused it to preserve a distinct fauna from the Sannine Formation, with a significant number of deepwater arthropods and chondrichthyans.\nAs with the sites of the Sannine Formation, the fossils of Sahel Alma are very well-preserved, and include the soft body parts of cartilaginous fish and cephalopods. Palaeoctopus, the first fossil octopus discovered with preserved soft tissues, was discovered from Sahel Alma.\nHistory\nThe Sahel Alma monastery, built with bricks from the site\nSahel Alma is one of the oldest-known fossil sites in Lebanon, second only to the Haqel site of the Sannine Formation. It has been known of since the Seventh Crusade in the 13th century, when bricks quarried out of it were used to build the eponymous Maronite monastery at Sahel Alma. A fossil fish presented to King Louis IX around this time may have been from the site. The site was also likely documented by C. F. Volney during the early 1780s. British adventurer Lady Hester Stanhope settled near Sahel Alma in the early 19th century, and helped to collect and circulate fossils from the site and Haqel. Paul-\u00c9mile Botta was also another prolific early researcher of the site.\nThe site is no longer accessible for scientific research as buildings were constructed over it, due to the purchase of the site by a private company, which restored the Sahel Alma monastery as a hotel.\nPaleobiota\nVertebrates\nCartilaginous fish\nRay-finned fishes\nInvertebrates\nArthropods\nMolluscs\nReferences\n^ a b c d George, Hady; Bazzi, Mohamad; El Hossny, Tamara; Ashraf, Nida; Abi Saad, Pierre; Clements, Thomas (2024-09-02). \"The famous fish beds of Lebanon: the Upper Cretaceous Lagerst\u00e4tten of Haqel, Hjoula, Nammoura and Sahel Aalma\".

    "\nPrince Jacques of Bourbon-Parma (Jacques Marie Antoine Robert Valdemar Charles Felix Sixte Ansger; 9 June 1922 \u2013 5 November 1964) was a French prince, pilot and racing car driver, from the House of Bourbon-Parma.\nHe was the brother of Queen Anne of Romania and a first cousin of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria and Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\nLife\nJacques was born in Longwy, France, on 9 June 1922, his parent's first wedding anniversary. He was the eldest child of Prince Ren\u00e9 of Bourbon-Parma and Princess Margrethe of Denmark. His parents were residing in Luxembourg but crossed the border for his birth as they wanted their son to be a French citizen. Paternally, he descended from Robert I, Duke of Parma; maternally, he descended from King Christian IX of Denmark. He was raised in Paris and attended the American School MacJannet in Saint-Cloud where his classmates included Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark.\nAfter the fall of Paris, Jacques and his mother and siblings fled to Portugal via Spain. From there, the Danish Consulate in Paris secured him and his mother passage to New York on the SS Excalibur. They arrived in New York since September 1940, staying initially at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Jacques and his brother were sent to Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf, a Jesuit school in Montreal. Here, he trained in the Canadian Officers' Training Corps.\nOn 23 November 1942, Jacques enlisted in the Royal Norwegian Air Force. Though recent policy changes had been enacted to curb the number of foreign volunteers in the service, Jacques's application was accepted, likely because King Haakon VII of Norway was his great-uncle. He trained in Canada and the United Kingdom. He flew ambulance service in northern Norway, even after the war's end, before being discharged on 1 May 1946.\nOn 9 June 1947, Jacques married Countess Birgitte of Holstein-Ledreborg (1922\u20132009), a descendant of Count Ludvig of Holstein-Ledreborg, sometime council president of Denmark. They had three children:\nPrince Philippe of Bourbon-Parma (born 22 January 1949)\nPrincess Lorraine Charlotte of Bourbon-Parma (born 27 July 1951)\nPrince Alain Jean of Bourbon-Parma (born 15 May 1955)\nAfter the war, he settled in Denmark. He worked for Danish Air Lines and Danish Air Taxa before retiring from flying in 1949 and working for the meat company Kristoffersen & Dehn. In the 1950s, he became interested in motor racing. He was protector of the Roskilde Ring and chairman of the Roskilde Motor and Rally Club. He won the 1959 Danish Touring Car Championship in the 1001-1300 cm3 class.\nJacques was killed on 5 November 1964 when he collided with a truck head-on near Roskilde. He is buried in Lejre near Ledreborg, the ancestral seat of his wife's family.\nHonours\n 1947: King Christian X's Liberty Medal\nAncestry\nSee also: Descendants of Christian IX of Denmark\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g \"Prince Jacques de Bourbon-Parma (1922 - 1964)\".

    "Extinct genus of tunicate\nMegasiphon thylakos is an extinct species of tunicate that lived in the Middle Cambrian 500 million years ago.\nMorphology, description and anatomy\nThe barrel-shaped main body extends apically into two long siphons of similar size, which have millimetric circular transverse muscle bands. The siphons have an axis of inclination of approximately 25\u00b0 with respect to the longitudinal axis of the organism and are associated with longitudinal muscular bands extending from the upper region.\nThe siphon with more extensive disaggregated muscle fibers and thicker muscle bands may be the oral siphon, while the other siphon is probably the auricular siphon. However, it is difficult to unequivocally differentiate between the two siphons based on the holotype.\nIn modern representatives of ascidians, the contraction of the circular and longitudinal musculature causes the ascidian to squirt or shrink. Its presence in Megasiphon indicates that these behavioral traits typical of tunicates had already evolved approximately 500 million years ago.\nThe holotype is very similar to phlebobrachs in morphology; in contrast, Megasiphon lacks any clear similarity to stalked stolidobranchs or motile thaliaceans, and its morphology is incompatible with tadpole-like appendiculars. The new species differs greatly from Shankouclava.\nEvolutionary implications for Olfactores\nSince external morphology alone may not be able to resolve the phylogenetic placement of Megasiphon relative to extant tunicates, it is more optimal to propose two alternative phylogenetic placements, which has profound evolutionary implications.\nMegasiphon may be a crown tunicate as a sister group to the clade uniting the modern Ascidiacea and Taliacea (Acopa). This location would indicate that the divergence between appendicularians and all other tunicates had already occurred earlier than indicated by the molecular clock estimated at 450 million years ago, pushing the divergence back approximately 50 million years. Other primitive ascidians such as Burykhia and possibly Ausia that date back 550 million years push the origin of the Acopa clade back even further than indicated by the molecular clock. This proposal follows the argument that an olfactorian and tunicate ancestor was motile, and that the sessile nature of ascidians is a derived character arising after appendicularians and vertebrates diverged from the modern ascidian lineage.\n\u00a0 Motile animal\n\u00a0 Sessile animal, with motile larva.\nAnother possibility is that, as with Shankouclava, Megasiphon may represent a stem-tunicate, a position that would indicate that a sea squirt-like body plan is ancestral to the entire Tunicata group, and the tadpole-like appendicular motile is a derived state. Supported by developmental biology and the report of massive gene loss in appendicularians, this hypothesis would imply that the first non-appendicular tunicates were probably sedentary-pelagic ascidian-like organisms, with a two-phase life cycle that included larval metamorphosis. The uniphasic and pelagic lifestyle would then be synapomorphic for thaliaceans. Using the molecular clock to indicate Megasiphon as a stem-tunicate because the divergence between Appendicularia and Acopa occurs 450 million years ago, implies that the 555-million-year-old Burykhia is possibly a stem-olfactorian, because the divergence among modern tunicates and vertebrates it occurs approximately 547 million years ago. Added to this is a study that indicates that vertebrates (and all Bilateria in general) descend from a sedentary ancestor in the adult stage but a pelagic ancestor in the larval stage, appealing to Hox genes, deep homologies and metamerism without segmentation. The unusual morphology of Shankouclava makes its relationship with the rest of the tunicates somewhat ambiguous because the oral siphon is not very defined and presents tentacle-like structures reminiscent of ambulacraria and lophophorates, it lacks an atrial siphon, and does not resemble phlebobranchs such as Megasiphon and Burykhia; Therefore it is possible that it is actually a more basal group of Olfactores.\nThe Megasiphon authors postulate the organism as a stem tunicate, rather than a stem Acopa, as more plausible because the position of Megasiphon as a main group tunicate does not require drastically changing the estimate of the molecular clock nor the origin of Ascidiacea given by the same, would instead only set minimum divergence estimates for the origins of Tunicata at about 500 million years ago; second, an evolutionary scenario involving sedentary-pelagic sessile ancestry appears to be more likely for Olfactores and Tunicata when consider other lines of evidence.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f Nanglu, Karma; Lerosey-Aubril, Rudy; Weaver, James C.; Ortega-Hern\u00e1ndez, Javier (2023-07-06). \"A mid-Cambrian tunicate and the deep origin of the ascidiacean body plan\".

    "\nThe Renati Chodas, also known as the Renadu Cholas, were a branch of Andhra Chodas who claimed descent from famous Early Chola King Karikala Chola. They ruled Renadu region in present day Andhra Pradesh between 5th century CE and 9th century CE.\nOrigin and history\nRenadu refers to a region in Andhra Pradesh, encompassing the present taluks of Pulivendula, Kamalapuram, and Jammalamadugu in the Cuddapah district, along with parts of the Kurnool district. Historical inscriptions mention Renadu-eduvelu (Renadu-7000), indicating that this area once consisted of 7,000 villages or revenue units. It was also known as Maharajavadi.\nThe earliest of this family was Nandivarman (500 CE) who claimed descent from the family of Karikala and the Kasyapa gotra. He had three sons, Simhavishnu, Sundarananda and Dhanunjaya, all of whom were ruling different territories simultaneously. They were forced to suzerainty of the Pallavas and sometimes they ruled independently.\nIn the first half of the seventh century CE, we find Punyakumara, a descendant of Dhanunjaya, ruling over Renadu and Hiranyarashtra. He too bears the title Erikal-Mutturaju.\nIn the 7th century CE, King Punyakumara of the Renati Cholas conquered Hiranya-rastra, a subdivision of the Pallava kingdom of Kanchi, and titled himself the lord of Hiranya-rastra in his Dommara Nandyala copper plate inscriptions. During his reign, the famous Buddhist traveler Hiuen-Tsang passed through Renadu and referred to the kingdom of Culiya, which is identified with this branch of Chola dynasty.\nThe Renati Cholas lost control of Renadu around the 10th century CE. An undated inscription at Yeligallu (Chittoor district) mentions a Vaidumba chief, Ganda Trinetra, ruling over Renadu-7000. Dated inscriptions of the Vaidumbas appear in places like Upparapalli in Proddatur taluk and Animela in Kamalapuram taluk from the last quarter of the 10th century CE.\nThe Renati Cholas frequently engaged in conflicts with the Vaidumbas and Rashtrakutas. Their inscriptions primarily record donations to temples and land to common people.\nDuring the rule of Chalukya king Pulakesi II, Chalukyas waged wars against the southern kingdoms, including the Renati Cholas. This caused a temporary setback for the Renati Cholas.\nThe dynasty regained strength under rulers like Renati Chola II (also known as Renati Rajasimha), who reigned in the early 9th century CE. He was known for his administrative skills and military conquests, which expanded the Renati Chola's influence.\nThey played a vital role in the history of Andhra Pradesh, and their legacy is evident in the cultural and architectural landmarks they left behind.\nRenati Choda Kings\nNandivarman Chola\nSimhavishnu, Sundarananda and Dhanunjayavarman\nMahendravikramavarma Chola\nGunamudita and Punyakumara Chola\nVikramaditya I\nSaktikumara Chola\nVikramaditya II\nUttamaditya and Satyaditya Chola\nNandivarman II (8th century) also known as Pallavamalla, was a significant ruler who extended his influence over the region who released the Udayendiram inscription (circa 770 CE) mentions Nandivarman II's conquests and administrative activities.\nDantivarman (9th century) who succeeded Nandivarman II and continued to consolidate the Chola power in the Renadu region. He Punganur inscription dated to 865 CE provides insights into his reign and contributions.\nContribution to Telugu language\nThe first and oldest Telugu inscription founded so far is Kalamalla inscription dating to 575 CE put up by Renati Chola king Erikal Mutturaju Dhanunjaya.\nThey have released significant number of Stone inscriptions and copper plate inscriptions in Telugu.\nRenati Cholas were the first known dynasty who made Telugu as official language. All the other previous rulers like Satavahanas, Andhra Ikshvaku used Prakrit as their official language. Renati Cholas claimed descendent from Sangam age Chola king Karikala Chola.\nThe Renati Cholas played a significant role in the history of Andhra Pradesh, leaving behind a legacy of cultural and architectural achievements. Despite their eventual decline, their contributions to administration, culture, and architecture continue to be remembered and studied.\nThe inscriptions at temples such as the Siddheswara Temple in Hemavathi provide details on temple endowments and cultural activities during their reign.\nSeveral inscriptions and artifacts have been found in regions like Kadapa, Punganur, and Hemavathi, providing substantial evidence of the Renati Chola's rule and their contributions to the region's cultural heritage.\nSee also\nChola Dynasty\nKakatiya Dynasty\nHistory of South India\nNotes\n^ Renati Chola kings stated that they belong to the family of Tamil Sangam age Chola king Karikala Chola.\nReferences\n^ Hultzsch, Eugene (1911\u20131912). \"Epigraphia Indica\".

    "Hockey team season\nThe 2024\u201325 Coachella Valley Firebirds season is the franchise's third season in the American Hockey League (AHL), starting on October 11, 2024. They play their home games at Acrisure Arena.\nThis is the first season of Derek Laxdal being the Firebirds' head coach, as he replaced Dan Bylsma at the position on July 5, 2024. This is because Bylsma was heading to the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Seattle Kraken to replace Dave Hakstol as their head coach.\nBackground\nMain article: 2023\u201324 Coachella Valley Firebirds season\nSee also: 2023\u201324 Seattle Kraken season\nDan Bylsma left the Firebirds in order to become the Seattle Kraken's head coach on May 28, 2024.\nThe Firebirds were founded as an expansion team in the Coachella Valley as the AHL affiliate of the NHL's Seattle Kraken, and started play during the AHL's 2022\u201323 season. During that season, the Firebirds achieved 103 points during the regular season, and eventually climbed to the Calder Cup Finals, only to lose to the Hershey Bears. During the Firebirds' 2023\u201324 season, they also achieved 103 points during the regular season, climbed to the Calder Cup Finals, and lost to the Hershey Bears.\nOn April 29, 2024, following the end of the Seattle Kraken's 2023\u201324 season, their head coach, Dave Hakstol, was fired. The Kraken organization made the decision to replace him with Coachella Valley Firebirds head coach Dan Bylsma on May 28. This was important for the Firebirds because, as previously mentioned, Bylsma had coached them all the way to the Calder Cup Finals in both of their seasons. On July 5, it was announced that Derek Laxdal was going to replace Bylsma.\nOn June 30, the Kraken prepared for the upcoming free agency by re-signing four players, all of whom had contributed to the Firebirds strong efforts the previous season\u2014John Hayden, Luke Henman, Ales Stezka, and Firebirds captain Max McCormick.\nOff-season\nSee also: 2024\u201325 Seattle Kraken season\nOn July 1, the first day of free agency, the Kraken lost six players, who had spent much of their time during the 2023\u201324 season with the Firebirds\u2014Devin Shore, Connor Carrick, Kole Lind, Cameron Hughes, Jimmy Schuldt, and Chris Driedger. Lind had been one of the driving forces in Coachella Valley\u2014over their two seasons, he had the most games played (141), the most assists (80), and was tied with Max McCormick for the most points (127). Driedger was yet another factor in the Firebirds' success, as he led the Firebirds in both games played (53) and wins (33) by a goaltender. The trend of players who had spent time with the Firebirds leaving continued on July 2, when and Peetro Seppala left the Kraken.\nThe Kraken made history on July 3, by hiring Jessica Campbell as an assistant coach, as she became the first woman to be in a coaching position in the NHL. She had spent the previous two seasons with the Firebirds, helping them reach the Calder Cup Finals during both of them. Also that day, Firebirds alternate captain Andrew Poturalski left the Kraken.\nTo replace Campbell, the Firebirds hired Brennan Sonne to be an assistant coach for the team on July 15. The previous season, Sonne had served as the head coach of the Western Hockey League (WHL)'s Saskatoon Blades, leading them to achieve the best regular season record in the WHL with 105 points.\nOn July 16, the Kraken saw the departure of another player who had spent time with the Firebirds, Mitch Reinke. On July 18, the first player who was directly under contract to the Firebirds left the team\u2014Justin Nachbaur. On August 1, the Firebirds re-signed player Ian McKinnon for one year. On August 6, it was accounted that the Firebirds were going to play two games at Cable Dahmer Arena, the home of the Firebirds' ECHL affiliate Kansas City Mavericks on October 4 and 5 against the Milwaukee Admirals. On August 8, the Firebirds signed their first player of free agency, Cam Morrison. The Firebirds re-signed goaltender Jack LaFontaine, on August 15. On August 20, the Firebirds signed Damien Giroux. Two days later, the Firebirds re-signed Max Andreev. During the previous season, Andreev qualified for the ECHL's 2023\u201324 All-Rookie Team after achieving 72 points in 61 games.\nStandings\n\u00a0y\u2013\u00a0 indicates team has clinched division and a playoff spot\n\u00a0x\u2013\u00a0 indicates team has clinched a playoff spot\n\u00a0e\u2013\u00a0 indicates team has been eliminated from playoff contention\nStandings as of June 25, 2024\nEastern Conference\nWestern Conference\nTransactions\nThe Firebirds have been involved in the following transactions during the 2024\u201325 season.\nTrades\nReferences\n^ a b \"Coachella Valley Firebirds hockey team statistics and history at HockeyDB.com\".

    "Species of gastropod\nAlcadia iheringi is a species of an operculate land snail, terrestrial gastropod mollusk in the family Helicinidae.\nDescription\nThe height of the shell attains 3.1\u00a0mm, its greatest diameter 3.8\u00a0mm.\n(Original description in German) The shell is broadly conical with a convex base or is nearly spherical. It is white or yellowish horn-colored, featuring dense, very fine raised spiral lines. (weathered specimens may exhibit relatively strong growth lines on the body whorl, likely due to weathering). The broadly conical, slightly convex spire comprises 4 slowly increasing, somewhat convex whorls, separated by a slightly impressed suture. The body whorl is indistinctly angular to rounded and descends very little or not at all in front.\nThe rounded triangular aperture is slightly oblique, with the slightly thickened outer lip being briefly expanded and reflexed. The basal margin is convex and extended forward. The very short, thin columella is curved forward and outward, and the thin basal callus is fairly clearly defined. \nDistribution\nThis species occurs in Brazil (S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro) \nReferences\n^ a b c Alcadia iheringi A.

    "Las Vegas revue\nFantasy: The Strip's Sexiest Tease (formerly known as Midnight Fantasy) is a revue performed on the Las Vegas Strip at the Luxor. Opened in November 1999, Fantasy is the topless production in Las Vegas with the longest duration at a single venue. Of female revues on the Strip, Fantasy was the earliest to open. The show is produced by the choreographer Anita Mann. It features 15 dance acts accompanied by classic and contemporary pop music that a vocalist performs live. After MGM Mirage purchased the Luxor in 2005, the production was renamed from Midnight Fantasy to Fantasy. MGM requested changes to comport with its focus on attracting a more youthful clientele. Choreographers Cris Judd and Eddie Garcia revised the numbers, lip synching was cut, and the number of topless scenes was reduced. Fantasy's dance routines and songs are changed every year.\nLead vocalists who have performed on the show have included Stephanie Dianna Sanchez (previously known as Stephanie Jordan), Angelica Bridges, Jaime Lynch, and Lorena Peril. Peril, the current lead vocalist, has been on the show since 2016. Comedians have also performed on the show including Carole Montgomery, Sean E. Cooper, John Padon, Murray SawChuck, and Shayma Tash. Other performers have been the juggler Anthony Gatto, the tap dancer Lindell Blake, and the stunt performer Jonathan Goodwin. Fantasy does not have crude or X-rated content, which reviewers said explain why the show's audience has many women and is largely made up of couples. Reviewers have largely praised the show's dancers for their artistry and skill. They lauded singer Lorena Peril for having a strong voice with wide range.\nHistory\nFantasy is a revue, cabaret, vampish show, and variety show. Joel Fischman, Mandalay Bay's entertainment director, reached out to the producer Anita Mann in 1999. He requested that she create an adult production for a theater housed in Luxor Las Vegas. Mann was given six weeks to choose, train, and outfit the performers after the company approved her plan. The topless show Midnight Fantasy began previews in October 1999. It debuted on November 1, 1999. Midnight Fantasy initially was scheduled to be performed for five months. It was later renewed and has been in a \"one-year rollover contract\" since 2000. Fischman said Midnight Fantasy is \"about exemplifying the female body and not degrading in any way ... it's a really classy, old-style topless show that's not vulgar in any way\". While Las Vegas properties targeted experiences to families in the 1990s, Midnight Fantasy was part of a trend in the early 2000s for resorts to try to attract a new, more hedonistic customer base. It violated Mandalay Bay's enduring \"no nudity\" rule at its properties.\nWhen it opened, aside from a Tuesday rest day, Midnight Fantasy ran daily. It was performed at 10pm every day, while Saturday had an additional midnight performance. After the impressionist Bill Acosta departed from the Luxor in November 2000, Fantasy increased the number of performances and refined the stage designs and outfits. That month, the show had midnight performances on Fridays and Saturdays. In 2001, the showtimes were set for 8:30pm and 10:30pm. Mann was the founding producer, while Tiger Martina was the founding choreographer. Midnight Fantasy's nine founding dancers were Betsy Alletzhauser, Georgia Bernasek, Dejah Juarez, Lisa Leieritz, Stacy Lyons, Jennifer Rohlman, Shannon Seil, Charidy Sullivan LaFontaine, and Jennifer Young. Bernasek and Young were the founding head dancers, while the founding floor captain was Dejah Juarez. The founding singers were Betsy Alletzhauser and Charidy Sullivan LaFontaine.\nAfter years away, it was Mann's comeback to the Strip. She previously had produced both family-friendly shows and stimulating revues. Throughout the show's history, Mann has introduced additional numbers. When Mann attends a performance, she documents her observations in a notebook and provides feedback to the cast who implement it in the following show. Featuring two cast members from the Las Vegas show, Midnight Fantasy was performed in 2004 at Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica Resorts, Mississippi.\nThe entertainment company MGM Mirage purchased Luxor in 2005. Mann was tasked with updating the show to comport with the company's focus on attracting a more youthful clientele. MGM wanted Fantasy to have a \"fun, young, party feel\" and not to rival their MGM Grand topless show La Femme. With MGM's consent, Midnight Fantasy was renamed to Fantasy in August 2005. Since the show no longer performed at midnight, audience members were often bewildered by the name. The show, which had not been refreshed since the end of 2000, underwent several changes. The show reduced the number of segments where the dancers were topless. MGM asked that long-time performers comedian Carole Montgomery and tap dancer Lindell Blake be excluded from the show which Mann implemented. Sal Salangsang, a comedian who had performed on MG",

    "\nDominican militant and soldier (1815\u20131863)\nGregorio de Lora (1815 \u2013 September 6, 1863) was a Dominican general who was a hero in the Dominican War of Independence. He would later fight in the Dominican Restoration War, in which he died in combat.\nEarly life\nHe was born in Puerto Plata in 1815, during the Espa\u00f1a Boba era. Not much is known about his childhood or early adulthood, but it is known that he had fought in the Dominican War of Independence; he was deserving of honorable mentions for the courage and ability demonstrated in the famous Battle of Sabana Larga, fought on January 24, 1856. He had attained the rank of Brigadier general and chief of a regiment by the end of the 1850s.\nRestoration War\nIn 1861, Spanish forces invaded the island. The Spanish kept him as commander of the square, but when the uprising led by\u00a0Juan Noues\u00ed, of August 27, 1863, De Lora was sent to repress and suffocate him. The patriots invited him to join the movement, De Lora accepted and was recognized on the spot as head of the restorative columns in Puerto Plata. The Spanish, surrounded in the San Felipe Fortress, were under the threatening siege of the patriots when reinforcements from Cuba and Puerto Rico arrived in the night of the same August 27 and based on their material superiority, they evicted the nationals from the urban area and forced them to retreat to the fields.\nThe resistance in Puerto Plata was under the command of Noues\u00ed, while De Lora marched to Santiago, where the battle for control of the city was being fought. He arrived via the Jamao route, joined the fight and in the decisive moments of the hard day September 6, 1863, he advanced with his men through the General Valverde Street, (today San Luis), taking a trench of the enemy. He fought with deadly intensity. The downloads rifle and cannon were made at point-blank range, and the besieged repelled the assailants with their points of the bayonets and with streams of shrapnel, as Gregorio Luper\u00f3n narrates.\nDeath\nDe Lora advanced heroically and with his proverbial fearlessness, when he fell wounded two steps away from the trench and could not continue fighting. Thirty officers died at his side from Puerto Plata, and before taking charge of the survivors of the column were left without their own boss, Luper\u00f3n ordered the transfer of the wounded in the canton of Los Chachaces. From there, they moved him to Moca, where the brave warrior contracted tetanus and died as a result. He was one of the four generals who fell during the Restoration War. The remaining three were Antonio Caba, in the combat on the San Pedro savanna; Santiago Mota, in the eastern town of Pulgar\u00edn; and Benito Mart\u00ednez, in the assault on the Spanish trenches in Puerto Plata.\nSee also\nAntonio Caba\nSantiago Mota\nBenito Mart\u00ednez\nGregorio Luper\u00f3n\nReferences\n^ Mej\u00eda, Rafael Chaljub (2007).

    "Singaporean former politician (1935\u20132022)\nIn this Chinese name, the family name is  Chai.\nChai Chong Yii (\u8521\u5d07\u8a9e, 1935 \u2013 3 May 2022) was a China-born Singaporean former politician. A former member of the People's Action Party (PAP), he served as the Member of Parliament representing Bukit Batok Single Member Constituency from 1972 to 1988.\nHe also served as Minister of State and later Senior Minister of State of Education from 1972 to 1974 and 1975 to 1981 respectively, the Minister of State of Communications from 1974 to 1975, and the Senior Minister of State of Culture from January 1981 to May 1981.\nEarly life and education\nChai was born in 1935 in China to peasants. His family migrated to Malaya (present-day Malaysia) when the Japanese started attacking coastal China. He spent his childhood in Taiping, Perak and attended Chung Ling High School and Nanyang University. He worked as a hawker and primary school teacher before entering Nanyang University. He took accounting and graduated in 1959 with a Bachelor in Commerce. He worked at Shell for 6 years before serving as the bursar of Nanyang University from 1965 to 1972.\nPolitical career\nChai had originally wanted to contest in the 1968 general election but was not able to due to having gotten his Singaporean citizenship in 1967, too late to place himself on the electoral register. He made his political debut at the 1972 general election, contesting for Member of Parliament (MP) representing Bukit Batok Single Member Constituency (SMC) against Rengaswamy Vetrivelu of United National Front. Chai was elected with 73.78% of the vote and was also appointed as Minister of State of Education.\nIn 1975, he was appointed Senior Minister of State of Education. Chai contested at the 1976 general election for MP representing Bukit Batok SMC against Sulaiman bin Jaffar of Singapore Justice Party. He was elected with 84.57% of the vote. From 1978 to 1979, he and the rest of the Education Ministry introduced the Special Assistance Plan in schools. In 1979, he laid the cornerstone of Bukit Batok Community Centre. In the 1980 general election, he contested for MP representing Bukit Batok SMC again, being elected unopposed.\nAt the 1984 general elections, he contested for MP of Bukit Batok SMC again, against Tan Jue Kit of United People's Front. He was elected with 78.27% of the vote. After this win, residents of Bukit Batok wanted to spend $4,000 on an advertisement to congratulate him. Chai instead donated the money to the Community Chest of Singapore. In 1988, he opened Bukit View Secondary School. He retired from politics that same year. Post his political career, Chai served as the auditor for PAP till 1996 and served as the Trade Representative to Taiwan from 1991 to 1994.\nPersonal life\nWhile he worked at Shell, he met his future wife Khor Phaik Tin, who studied at Teacher's College in Kuala Lumpur. In 2014, he and other retired PAP MPs wrote an essay on their experiences.\nDeath\nChai died on 3 May 2022 at 87. He was survived by his wife, 3 children, and 6 grandchildren.\nReferences\n^ a b Tan, Wang Joo (24 September 1972). \"The way to the top \u2014how six new MPs went up the ladder\".

    "Colombian regional and municipal elections\nThe 2011 Colombian regional and municipal elections were held on October 30, 2011  to elect the governors of 32  departments and their Department Assemblies, the mayors of 1099 municipalities and their city councils, and the Local Administrative Juntas (JAL) of national territories.\nBackground\nBogot\u00e1\nThe last mayor elected in Bogot\u00e1 before the 2011 elections, Samuel Moreno, was suspended after a scandal over public works bids by Colombia's inspector general. He was replaced by an interim mayor, Clara L\u00f3pez Obreg\u00f3n, until the 2011 elections.\nPre-election violence\nLeading up to the elections, 41 candidates were assassinated with many others receiving threats against their lives or those of their family. Then President Juan Manuel Santos deployed 300,000 troops in an effort to prevent violence against candidates and voters. Electoral Observation Mission (MOE), a Colombian civil society network active in election monitoring training, created a crowdsourcing website, \"Pilas con el Voto\" (vote watch), just prior to the elections to encourage both anonymous and non-anonymous reporting of election-related violence and irregularities in the voting itself and for publishing maps and analyses of these.\nResults\n2011 Bogot\u00e1 Mayoral Race results by locality\u00a0 Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa \u00a0 Gustavo Petro\nAmong the winners of the 2011 elections was future 34th President Gustavo Petro. Petro ran and won a campaign for the mayor of Bogot\u00e1, the nations capital city, under the Progresistas Party against Green Party and Union Party for the People's candidate, and former mayor, Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa Londo\u00f1o and independent Gina Parody. The first independent mayor of Medell\u00edn, Sergio Fajardo, successfully ran for Governor of Medell\u00edn's Antioquia Department under the Green Party. \nA notable losing candidate was Mar\u00eda Isabel Urrutia, an Olympic weightlifter that won Colombia's first gold medal in 2000, who unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Cali under the Alternative Democratic Pole. She would later be appointed as Minister of Sports in Gustavo Petro's Cabinet. \nA number of candidates for mayoral, municipal, and gubernatorial offices were alleged to have ties with paramilitaries.

Graham bought the plantation in 1774 and rebuilt the main house and new supporting buildings; however, at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, Graham abandoned the plantation and his vault, moving back to England. \nMaitland interment\nMaitland, who was son of Charles Maitland, 6th Earl of Lauderdale, was a lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Battalion, 71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders. In June 1779, he fought at the Battle of Stono Ferry, in which he commanded the British redoubt and helped lift the siege of Savannah. He died of malaria in Savannah in October 1779 and was buried in the Graham Vault.\nGreene interment\nThe Graham Vault, Colonial Park Cemetery, Savannah, Georgia\nAfter returning to his native Newport, Rhode Island, after the Revolutionary War, Greene moved to Savannah in 1785 after being awarded ownership of Graham's Mulberry Grove Plantation. Greene fell ill on June 12, 1786, and he died at Mulberry Grove seven days later, at the age of 43. He was buried in the Graham Vault, alongside Maitland.\nDisinterment\nMailtand and Greene remained buried together until the 20th century. Though some histories refer to them as rivals, there is no evidence they faced one another in battle.\nOn November 14, 1902, Greene's remains were identified and moved to underneath the Nathanael Greene Monument in Savannah's Johnson Square.\nEight decades later, in 1981, Maitland's remains were identified and disinterred and sent back to his native Scotland, where they were reinterred in the Maitland family vault in the Lauderdale Aisle of St. Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington.\nReferences\n^ \"Mulberry Grove Foundation, Inc\". mulberrygrove.org.

    "Musical artist\nGuy Van Nueten (born July 25, 1965, in Turnhout, Belgium) is a Belgian composer, pianist and record producer.\nLife and career\nVan Nueten began playing the piano at the age of four when his mother enrolled him in the local music school. He learned to read music before learning to read words. In his teenage years, he developed an interest in pop and rock music, and after completing his studies in mathematical economics, he fully committed to a career in music.\nIn the early years of his career, Van Nueten was a member of the band The Sands, whose self-titled debut album was produced by Bill Janovitz of the American band Buffalo Tom and released worldwide by Universal Records. The band toured Europe, including performances with John Cale. Van Nueten wrote The Sands' notable track \"April and June,\" which became a staple on Belgian radio and frequently appeared on \"Top 100 Belgian Songs of All Time\" lists.\nIn 1998, Van Nueten decided to shift his musical focus and enrolled at a conservatory to study composition and harmony. Under the guidance of internationally renowned pedagogue Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge, he refined his piano skills.\nVan Nueten has composed music for film directors, theater productions, and choreographers. His compositions have been featured in productions by prominent Benelux theaters, including Toneelhuis, Toneelgroep Amsterdam, Les Ballets C de la B, and HETPALEIS. In 2005, he composed the musical Soepkinders. He has also composed for films by directors such as Koen Mortier (Ex Drummer) and Alex Stockman (Eva, Pulsar).\nThe music magazine OOR described his work for Les Ballets C de la B's dance production B\u00e2che as a masterpiece, noting the unique combination of modern electronic soundscapes with emotive Elizabethan music.\nIn 2016, Van Nueten was recognized as a Fellow at the Sundance Institute for his work on the dance performance Verveling (Boredom), a collaboration with dancer Sheila Rojas and choreographer Amar Al-Bojrad. This fellowship is part of the institute's international cultural exchange programs to support independent artists from the Middle East and North Africa.\nAs a performer and arranger, Van Nueten has contributed to albums by artists such as dEUS, Admiral Freebee, Zita Swoon, Magnus, Tim Vanhamel, and DAAN. Two of his songs have been included in the \"Top 100 Belgian Songs of All Time\" by the Belgian magazine Knack. His collaboration with Tom Barman, the double album Live, featured piano arrangements and was released across Europe, appearing on several best-of-the-year lists in 2003.\nIn 2009, Van Nueten released Merg, a contemporary classical solo album with influences from Baroque music and composers like Johann Sebastian Bach. In 2013, he followed up with Pacman, which was described by VRT Canvas' cobra.be as \"timeless and free from trends\". The Pacman trilogy concluded in 2018 with the release of Contact, marking Van Nueten as the first Belgian artist to release an album on Sony Classical. In Humo, Tom Lanoye praised it as the most captivating album of the COVID-19 pandemic year, 2020.\nIn the fall of 2019, Van Nueten released the EP Night Has Come, featuring music from the soundtrack of Peter Van Goethem's film Night Has Come. The following years saw the release of the EPs As Played By, Wired, and Pulsar, which are part of Decent Music, a collection of works composed by Van Nueten between 2000 and 2020 for theater, film, and dance.\nMusic\nTheater, musical, dance\nHet Beest, FroeFroe/HETPALEIS, director: Marc Maillard (2000)\nBeautiful Red Dress, Podium Modern, director: Manou Kersting (2001)\nWinter onder de tafel, HETPALEIS, director: Peter de Graef (2002\u20132004)\nVan muizen en mensen, Laika/Blauw4, director: Jo Roets (2003\u20132005)\nVilla Fink van Laika/De Blauwe Engel, director: No\u00ebl Fisher (2003)\nPercursos/Hotel Tomilho, Laika, concept: Peter De Bie, director: Jo Roets (2004, 2005, 2007)\nSoepkinders (musical), Laika/HETPALEIS, text: Gerda Dendooven, director: Jo Roets (2005\u20132008)\nB\u00e2che, Les Ballets C de la B, choreography: Koen Augustijnen (2004\u20132006)\nMerg, De Roovers, text: Judith Herzberg, director: de Roovers (2006)\nImport-Export, Les Ballets C de la B, choreography: Koen Augustijnen (2006\u20132008)\nRunway show Dries Van Noten (with dEUS), men's collection, Milan (2007)\nMaria Magdalena, Toneelhuis (Antwerpen), director: Wayn Traub (2008)\nDe 7 hoofdzonden, Cellopalladio, articitic coordination: Katelijn Van Kerckhoven (2009)\n't Takkenkind (musical), Laika, text: Gerda Dendooven, director: Jo Roets (2009\u20132010, 2013\u20132014)\nMoederland (musical), Theater Stap, director: Lies Van Assche (2010\u20132011)\nVerveling/Boredom (dance), Moussem, director: Amar Al Bojrad (2012, 2016)\nWDSASE (dance), Monty, choreography: Duraid Al Abbas (2013)\nSolitary Confinement (eenzame opsluiting), Moussem, director: Strange Fruit (2013)\nThe Medium (musical), Walpurgis, regie: Judith Vindevogel (2015)\nSkin, Compagnie Malka (FRA), choreography: Bouba Landrille Tchouda (2015\u20132016)\nVerveling (Boredom), WPZimmer/",

    "Historical place in Albany County, Wyomingy, United States\nTrail to Laramie Peak\nCamp Esterbrook is a historical site in the Medicine Bow National Forest in Albany County of eastern Wyoming in the United States in the Laramie Mountains. Camp Esterbrook was in the in the Laramie Peak area, closest town is the community of Esterbrook, Wyoming north of the camp. Camp Esterbrook is at about 7,400 feet (2,300\u00a0m) elevation near the Esterbrook Creek. Camp Esterbrook opened in spring 1944 and operated as World War 2 Prisoner of war (POW) camp.  Today there are a few remains of the camp.\nCivilian Conservation Corps\nEsterbrook CCC Camp was one of 15 United States Forest Service Civilian Conservation Corps camps in the state Wyoming during the Great Depression. Medicine Bow National Forest had other US Forest Service Civilian Conservation Corps camps: Ryan Park, Forest\u2014at Pole Mountain, Chimney Park, Centennial Work Center, Arlington, Encampment, and French Creek. The worker first lived in tents and them built their own housing. The camp was made up of young unmarried men from the East Coast of the United States. The camp planted tree, build roads, trails, campgrounds, and US Forest ranger stations. The camp built the Esterbrook fire lookout. When needed the camp also worked as firefighters. Many of the Esterbrook CCC Camp projects are still in use today.\nPrisoner of war camp\nDuring World War 2, starting in spring 1944 German prisoners were housed at Camp Esterbrook. Camp Esterbrook prisoners of war were used for timber operations. Prisoner of war labor worked for civilian employers under the military officials and the Department of Agriculture's Extension Service. The camp worked six days a week, with Sunday off. The POW Labor Program benefited the US as there was shortage of labor during the war. About 75 POWs lived at the camp, with about 7 Army guards. Most POWs came from Camp Douglas (Wyoming). The local logging companies paid the prisoner labor, now lumberjacks, the same as local civilians. The POWs cut timber for railroad ties`. Evidence can still be found of the camp, including building foundations, wells and latrine pits. At the end of the war the camp closed in January 1946. At first the camp held Italian POWs. In April 1944 the Italians POWs were moved out. German  POWs moved in.  In April 1944 the Italians were able to volunteer for Italian Service Units, this was non-combat duty in special service units of the United States Army. To join the Italian Service Unit, each Italians volunteer could sign a pledge to perform any non-combat duty to help the United States against the now common enemy, Nazi Germany.\nDuring World War II, two large POW base camps, (Camp Douglas and Fort Francis E. Warren), and seventeen smaller camps that did agricultural and timber work were located in Wyoming. Other smaller camps in Wyoming were: Basin, Wyoming (sugar beet harvest), Clearmont (sugar beet harvest), Deaver (sugar beet harvest), Dubois (timber camp), Esterbrook (timber camp), Huntley (sugar beet harvest), Lingle (agriculture), Lovell (remodeling the Lovell Armory and Cavalry Barn, and then sugar beet harvest), Pine Bluffs (sugar beet and potato harvest), Powell (sugar beet harvest), Riverton (sugar beet harvest), Torrington (agriculture), Veteran (agriculture), Wheatland (agriculture), Ryan Park Camp  (timber), Centennial POW Camp (timber) and Worland (agriculture).\nSee also\nCamp Douglas (Wyoming)\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Laramie Peak.\nEsterbrook at Wyoming places\nHR Wilderness Camp in Esterbrook Wyoming\n\"World War II POW Camps of Wyoming with Author Cheryl O'Brien\" on YouTube\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Nineteen Camps: World War II POWs in Wyoming | WyoHistory.org\". www.wyohistory.org.\n^ kbrown@gillettenewsrecord.net, KATHY BROWN News Record Senior Writer (April 18, 2019). \"Wyoming had 19 POW camps in World War II\".

    "Town part in Pardubice, Czech Republic\nDoln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec (Czech pronunciation: ; German: Nieder Johnsdorf) is an administrative part of Lan\u0161kroun in \u00dast\u00ed nad Orlic\u00ed District in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 900 inhabitants. It is located in the northern part of the town's territory. Until 1960, it was a separate municipality.\nHistory\nThe first written mention of T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec is from 1332. In 1568, for the first time, Doln\u00ed and Horn\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec are distinguished. In 1793, the first school in Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec was built, it was the 104th building in the village. In 1798 Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec became an independent political community. Until then, all purchases and transfers of ownership had to be confirmed by the Lan\u0161kroun City Council. During Austro-Prussian War (1866) a large number of Prussian soldiers were housed in Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec. In 1880, the local volunteer fire department was founded. In 1894, a two-classroom school building with a teacher's apartment and a gym was built opposite the \"old\" school. In the same year, on the occasion of the imperial maneuvers, Franz Joseph I of Austria personally went to Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec and awarded some veterans with a golden cross of honor.\nA difficult situation arose in 1905, when the manor of Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec was offered for sale. The Czechs offered any price just to gain ownership of a huge complex just near to Lan\u0161kroun. So the money had to be found on the private market. Since no suitable German buyer could be found for the entire property, the fields and meadows were sold piece by piece, and the building with parts of the land was taken over in 1907 by the League of Germans against Czechs for the orphanage. Due to the fact that the orphanage was permanently occupied by 40-60 pupils until its abolition in 1941, most of them then became pupils of the Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec's School, the expansion of the school was carried out in 1909 under the leadership of the municipal leader Johann Peichl. In the summer of 1923, the municipality had a memorial built for the 34 victims of World War I. Electricity was introduced here in 1928.\nIn 1960, Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec again became a part of Lan\u0161kroun after 162 years.\nFirefighter unit\nIn 1880, a shed for firemen's tools (now the firestation) was built. The unit was officially approved and registered in the cadastre of associations of the town on 9 February 1886. After Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec became a part of Lan\u0161kroun in 1960, the function of the unit was reclassified to support and humanitarian. Thr unit still holds this function.\nThanks to the boom of firesport, the first year of the competition called O zelen\u00fd poh\u00e1r in the Fire Attack discipline was organized in 1993. In 2025, the 31st year of this competition will take place.\nSport\nThe football club TJ Sokol Doln\u00ed T\u0159e\u0161\u0148ovec was founded in 1956. The team participates in the 9th highest Czech competition.\nEducation\nIn 1946, the Agricultural and Veterinary Secondary School was founded in the building of the former orphanage. On 1 September 1964, the new building of the Agricultural and Veterinary Secondary School was opened. In 2008 and 2009, the main school buildings were renovated. At the same time, a new cowshed and veterinary centre were built. Two fields of study are currently taught at the school: Agribusiness and Veterinary Medicine.\nReferences\n^ \"V\u00fdsledky s\u010d\u00edt\u00e1n\u00ed 2021 \u2013 otev\u0159en\u00e1 data\" (in Czech).

    "1979 single by Akira Fuse\n\"Kimi wa Bara yori Utsukush\u012b\" (Japanese: \u541b\u306f\u8594\u8587\u3088\u308a\u7f8e\u3057\u3044, lit. \"You're More Beautiful Than a Rose\") (Japanese pronunciation: ) is a song by Japanese singer Akira Fuse from his ninth studio album, Survival, Ai Aru Kagiri Kimi wa Utsukush\u012b (1979). Written by lyricist Kenji Kadoya\u00a0 and composer Mickie Yoshino, it was released through King Records on January 17, 1979, as Fuse's 42nd single. A light ballad, its lyrics are set from the perspective of a man who meets a woman he observes has changed to be more beautiful than a rose.\nBackground and release\nAkira Fuse was inspired to become a singer by the twin vocal group the Peanuts. As a high schooler, Fuse gave a passing audition on the television program Aji no Moto Hoihoi Music School\u200a\u00a0 and was subsequently scouted by Watanabe Productions, who were also managing the Peanuts. He made his solo debut through King Records with the single \"Kimi ni Namida to Hohoemi o\" in 1975, a Japanese version of the Italian \"Se piangi, se ridi\" (1965). In the following years, he saw success with hit songs including \"Kiri no Mash\u016bko\" (1966), \"Koi\" (1967), \"Ai wa Fushich\u014d\" (1970), and \"Tsumiki no Heya\" (1976). His 1975 single \"Cyclamen no Kahori\" sold over a million copies and won the Grand Prix at the Japan Record Awards.\nWithin the latter half of the 1970s, rival cosmetics companies Shiseido and Kanebo\u00a0 ran competing advertisement campaigns centered on recognizable commercial jingles. Though the start of the decade had seen focus on slogans and attractive models, Shiseido transitioned to music-based advertising starting with \"Haru no Asa\" by Lily in 1975. Following suit, Kanebo launched similar campaigns starting with \"Ginza Red Oui Oui\" by singer Dave in 1976. In 1978, competition for high chart positions intensed when Shiseido's \"Jikan yo, Tomare\" by Eikichi Yazawa and Kanebo's \"Mister Summertime (Natsu Monogatari)\" by Circus both achieved first place on the Oricon Singles Chart.\n\"Kimi wa Bara yori Utsukush\u012b\" was released by King Records on January 17, 1979. It was used as the jingle in Kanebo's 1979 spring campaign, with the song's title doubling as its slogan. That year in what kay\u014dkyoku journalist Hideki Hamaguchi described as the Rose War, Shiseido primarily promoted their campaign through the film Lady Oscar (known as the Rose of Versailles in Japan) and starred the lead actress Catriona MacColl in commercials. To compete, Kanebo's commercials featured British-Argentine actress Olivia Hussey, who had gained recognition in Japan for her role in Romeo and Juliet (1968). Following the release of \"Kimi wa Bara yori Utsukush\u012b\", Fuse and Hussey began dating upon the latter's visit to Japan; they married in 1980, but divorced in 1989.\nComposition and reception\n\"Kimi wa Bara yori Utsukush\u012b\"\nThe final chorus to \"Kimi wa Bara yori Utsukush\u012b\". It is a light ballad and pop song. Lyrically, Fuse sings of a woman who has changed to be more beautiful than a rose, ending with the word kawatta (lit. 'changed') in high note.\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\n\"Kimi wa Bara yori Utsukush\u012b\" was composed and arranged by Mickie Yoshino of Godiego, who previously performed Kanebo's 1977 summer campaign song \"Salad Girl\". Kenji Kadoya\u00a0 wrote the song's lyrics. Fellow Godiego member Takami Asano arranged the B-side \"C'est la Vie (Jinsei Nante Sonna Mono sa)\", which features lyrics and composition written by Fuse. Musically, \"Kimi wa Bara yori Utsukush\u012b\" is a light and cheerful ballad and pop song for the spring season, demonstrating elements of Yoshino's musical style. Opening with a brass intro, the songs moves to an odd time signature with the chorus, and ends with Fuse singing the word kawatta (lit. 'changed') in high note. Reviewers for CDJournal described Fuse's vocals as pop transformed into soul. Lyrically, the song presents the perspective of a man who meets a woman he hasn't seen for a long time, and finds that she has changed into something more beautiful than a rose.\nThough Fuse's popularity had feigned in 1977\u201378, \"Kimi wa Bara yori Utsukush\u012b\" was a commercial hit. It sold circa 400,000 copies in Japan according to Sports Nippon and reached number eight on the Oricon Singles Chart, Fuse's first top ten entry since the number-one \"Ochiba ga Yuki ni\" (1976). Based on factors of sales, airplay, and music TV program rankings, Sports Nippon ranked it as the sixth most-popular song of April 1979. The newspaper's staff wrote that there were \"probably no women who didn't feel excited when  that \" by Fuse, the \"king of ballads\". Alongside the follow-up single \"Koi no Survival\" \u2013 a Japanese cover of the English-language \"I Will Survive\" (1978) \u2013 the song was released on Fuse's ninth album Survival, Ai Aru Kagiri Kimi wa Utsukush\u012b (1979; lit. 'Survival: As Long As There Is Love, You Are Beautiful').\nRetrospectively, \"Kimi wa Bara yori Utsukush\u012b\" has been named amongst Fuse's most representative songs in profiles by Oricon and Excite Japan.

    "\nAnnie Isabel Rankine MBE (26 February 1917 \u2013 11 June 1972) was an Aboriginal Australian community leader.\nEarly life\nAnnie Isabel Rankine was born in 1917 in Raukkan, South Australia, which was then called Point McLeay mission,  an Aboriginal reserve. Her mother was Polly (born Beck) and her father was Clarence Long, both born in South Australia. She was their third child and in time she had ten siblings.\nShe married Hendle Henry Rankine in 1935 and in two rooms they raised nine children and fostered more.\nCareer\nThe local Ngarrindjeri community was then run by outsiders and the Rankines were unusually trusted to organise themselves \u2013 freedoms not given to many of their peers. She worked for the community, attending and cleaning the church, and also cleaned the school.\nThe Point McLeay community council was created in 1968 and she was elected as its first chair. She had argued that her people needed to care for themselves and they should not be \"spoon-fed\". The community had never governed themselves until 1974, when it became responsible for its own governance.\nHonours\nRankine's work in her community was recognised in 1970 when she became a Member of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Queen's 1970 Birthday Honours.\nDeath and legacy\nRankine died in the hospital in Tailem Bend in 1972. Three of her five sons and one of her four daughters died before her. Her three surviving daughters worked at the Aboriginal Women's Home. The home in North Adelaide provided accommodation for Aboriginal women and their children, who had few other alternatives, while they accessed medical care.\nShe was succeeded as the chair of Point McLeay community council by her son, Henry. He followed her lead and he became a justice of the peace. He was also a storyteller. In 1992 he was also recognised, this time with a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM).\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g Raftery, Judith, \"Annie Isabel Rankine (1917\u20131972)\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, Canberra: National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, retrieved 3 August 2024\n^ SLSA (30 December 2005), Aboriginal Australians and the river\u00a0: Aboriginal missions on the River Murray, SLSA, retrieved 3 August 2024\n^ Project, Australian Women's Archives. \"Faith, Hope, Charity - Australian Women and Imperial Honours - Browse Alpha - R\". www.womenaustralia.info.

    "Mexican writer (born 1979)\nArtemisa T\u00e9llez (Mexico City, August 24, 1979) is a Mexican author. Her literary works have focused on exploring sapphism and sexual diversity, which has led to her being considered one of the most important representatives of Mexican lesbian literature.\nAs an instructor, she has offered courses on reading and writing literature that highlight Mexican writers and women's erotic stories.\nLiterary career\nT\u00e9llez's first work of poetry was published in 2010 with the title Cuerpo de mi soledad (\"Body of my Solitude\"). The poems deal with themes of love and erotic female relationships.\nIn 2014, she published the novel Crema de vanilla (\"Vanilla Cream\") with the publisher Voces en Tinta. It tells the story of a female university student who meets a woman named Lala, who she feels attracted to and with whom she begins a relationship. The novel caused a controversy after its publication concerning violence in relation to the protagonists, which is expressed in perverse sexual games that the characters play. However, academics like C\u00e9sar Ca\u00f1edo have noted that the novel can be read as a sapphic narrative and that its publication marks a key moment in the Mexican lesbian narrative.\nT\u00e9llez's next work was the short story collection Fotograf\u00edas instant\u00e1neas (\"Instant Photographs\"), published in 2016. Its main theme deals with love between women in Mexico City's lesbian underworld.\nIn the latter half of the 2010s, T\u00e9llez primarily focused on poetry. This period produced the poetry collections Cangrejo (\"Crab,\" 2017), Larga herida (\"A Lengthy Injury,\" 2018), Casa sin fin (\"Endless House,\" 2018), and Mujeres de Cromagnon (\"Cro-magnon Women,\" 2020).\nWorks\nProse\nCrema de vainilla (2014), novel\nFotograf\u00edas instant\u00e1neas (2016), stories\nPoetry\nCuerpo de mi soledad (2010)\nCangrejo (2017)\nLarga herida (2018)\nCasa sin fin (2018)\nMujeres de Cromagnon (2020)\nSee also\nLGBT literature in Mexico\nLesbian erotica\nReferences\n^ a b \"Hablemos Escritoras \u00b7 Perfil de Escritora: Artemisa T\u00e9llez\". web.archive.org. 2022-07-03.

    "Boxing match\nLarry Holmes vs. Leon Spinks, billed as A Tribute to Joe Louis was a professional boxing match contested on June 12, 1981, for the WBC heavyweight title.\nBackground\nPromoter Don King had hoped to pit reigning WBC heavyweight champion Larry Holmes against former undisputed heavyweight shortly after Holmes' lopsided victory over an aging Muhammad Ali, announcing his plans in a press conference in late November 1980. The WBC, however, recognized Gerry Cooney as their top ranked contender and chose not to elevate Spinks in their rankings to replace Cooney, temporarily delaying the fight. With Holmes and Cooney unable to come to terms, Holmes was instead matched up against Trevor Berbick, with King stating he was still working on a Holmes\u2013Spinks title fight as a follow-up for Holmes should he defeat Berbick. After Holmes defeated Berbick on April 11, 1981, his defense against Spinks was set. Originally the fight was to take place in Caesars Palace in the Las Vegas Valley on May 22, where seven of Holmes' ten title fights had taken place, however, the fight was moved back to June 12 and the venue switched to Detroit after it was reported that both fighters wanted more time to prepare. King decided to belatedly dedicate the fight to the memory of Joe Louis, the great former heavyweight champion from Detroit, whom had died two months earlier after attending the Holmes\u2013Berbick fight, with the fight taking place in his namesake arena. Holmes was a 4 to 1 favorite going into the bout.\nThis was the first heavyweight title bout in Detroit since November 1970, when Joe Frazier knocked out light heavyweight champion Bob Foster in the second round at the Cobo Arena.\nThe fight\nAs the fight began, Spinks went at Holmes aggressively, though Holmes used his trademark left jab to keep Spinks at bay and easily won the round. In the second, Holmes was still in control of the fight when the bell was accidentally rang 25 seconds before the round ended, leading to confusion as Holmes, thinking the round was over, dropped his hands momentarily, allowing Spinks to land a big right before the round officially ended. Holmes, seemingly angered by the mishap, dominated Spinks in the third round, backing him against the ropes and then landing several right hands that sent Spinks stumbling across the canvas, into the ropes and then onto the canvas. Spinks barely answered the referee's count at nine and was allowed to continue but Holmes quickly trapped the clearly hurt Spinks in the corner and continued to land punishing blows. Spinks' younger brother Michael, whom was in his brothers corner, attempted to enter the ring to stop the fight but was restrained from doing so, while assistant trainer Dale Williams threw a white towel into the ring to signify surrender, though referee Richard Steele had already stepped in to end the fight. Holmes was declared the winner by technical knockout at 2:34 of the round.\nAftermath\nThis was Spinks's last heavyweight bout for some years, as he moved up to box in the cruiserweight division.\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For WBC heavyweight title ^Note 2 For WBC lightweight title\nBroadcasting\nReferences\n^ \"Larry Holmes vs. Leon Spinks\". boxrec.com.

    "\nAeroflot Flight F-77 was an An-24B operating from Moscow to Bugulma with an intermediate stop in Cheboksary that crashed near Bugulma on Sunday, March 2, 1986, resulting in the deaths of all 38 occupants on board.\nAircraft\nThe An-24B with tail number 46423 (serial number 87304108) was manufactured by the Antonov factory on February 20, 1968. At the time of the accident, the airliner had accumulated a total of 31,570 flight hours and 23,765 landings.\nPreceding circumstances\nThe aircraft was operating flight F-77 from Moscow to Bugulma with an intermediate stop in Cheboksary. It was piloted by a crew from the 61st Flight Detachment, consisting of Captain V. A. Pastukhov, co-pilot A. S. Cheprasov, and flight engineer A. B. Shtein. Flight attendant N. A. Baskakova was working in the cabin. At 02:02 Moscow time, the An-24 took off from Cheboksary airport and, after climbing, leveled off at a cruising altitude of 4,500 meters. There were 34 passengers on board: 32 adults and 2 children.\nAccording to the weather forecast available to the crew, Bugulma was expected to have overcast conditions with a cloud base at 120 meters and an upper boundary at 3,000 meters, fresh southeast winds (160\u00b0 5\u00a0m/s), heavy snowfall, mist, and visibility of 1,500 meters. Occasionally, fog was expected, reducing horizontal visibility to 800 meters and vertical visibility to 80 meters. The actual weather in Bugulma almost matched the forecast, with visibility even reaching 4,000 meters \u2014 more than twice the expected. This weather was within the meteorological minimum for the captain.\nAs the aircraft approached Bugulma, at 02:54 Moscow time (52 minutes into the flight), the crew, after receiving clearance from the dispatcher, disconnected the autopilot and began descending to the circuit altitude of 400 meters, which they reached 20 kilometers from Bugulma airport. Following the dispatcher's instructions, the approach was made with a right turn according to ILS with a landing course of 192\u00b0. At 16 kilometers from the runway threshold, the crew made the fourth turn and aligned with the final approach. Without deviation from the operating manual, the landing gear and flaps were deployed to 15\u00b0. The flight speed was 230\u00a0km/h, and the engine mode was initially set to 28-30\u00b0 on the thrust lever position indicator. At 03:04 Moscow time (63 minutes into the flight), the crew extended the flaps to the landing position (38\u00b0) as per the manual. Due to the increased aerodynamic drag, the engine mode was increased to 40\u00b0 on the thrust lever position indicator.\nAccident\nHowever, a second after increasing the mode, at a speed of 225\u00a0km/h, the left engine's automatic feathering system spontaneously activated, feathering the left propeller. This caused asymmetrical thrust, resulting in a right yawing moment, and the aircraft began to bank to the left, reaching a 20\u00b0 bank angle within 5 seconds, and deviated to the left. The crew noticed the failure of the left power unit almost immediately and attempted to counter the left bank by deflecting the ailerons to 19\u00b0 for a right bank and pressing the right rudder pedal forcefully to turn the rudder right. However, by pressing the right pedal, the pilots only neutralized the rudder, as the aircraft began slipping to the left. The forces applied to the pedal (15\u00a0kg) merely held the rudder in a neutral position, failing to counteract the yawing moment. However, through aileron deflection, the crew managed to reduce the left bank to 9\u00b0.\nDue to the high sideslip angle, speed began to decrease, prompting the pilots to push the control yokes forward, attempting to increase speed by pointing the nose down. However, this measure was ineffective, so the crew moved the remaining operational right engine to takeoff mode, forgetting that, according to the manual, they should first level the aircraft out of the left bank and into a right one. As a result, the left bank increased, exceeding 50\u00b0, and the sideslip and pitch angles also increased. Aerodynamic drag increased by 1.5 times, causing speed to drop. The crew attempted to correct the bank with full aileron and rudder deflection, but these measures were too late. By this time, the airliner was flying at a speed of 155\u00a0km/h with a sideslip angle of 18-21\u00b0 and had deviated 50\u00b0 from the landing course (to 142\u00b0).\nAt a speed of 140\u00a0km/h, the An-24 stalled, and its bank angle rapidly reached 110\u00b0. Twenty-five seconds after the left engine shutdown, the aircraft, with a 40\u00b0 nose-down angle and a 3\u00b0 left bank, flying at a heading of 15\u00b0, hit the ground at a forward speed of 320\u00a0km/h and a vertical speed of 40\u00a0m/s, 8 kilometers from the runway threshold on an azimuth of 15\u00b0 (500 meters from the runway centerline). The airliner was completely destroyed on impact, and the debris scattered over an area of 136 by 40 meters, but no fire ensued. All 38 people on board perished.\nCauses\nAccording to data from the flight recorder, when the crew increased the engine mode after extending",

    "American musician, composer and record producer\nDougie Bowne is an American musician, producer and composer.\nBowne was born in New York, grew up in The Bronx and attended high school and college in South Jersey. He has worked in a variety of musical settings, with a number of artists, notably Iggy Pop, John Cale, Laurie Anderson, Jack Bruce, Cassandra Wilson, Marianne Faithfull, Marc Anthony Thompson, Cibo Matto, and Ryuichi Sakamoto.\nBiography\nA self-taught drummer, Bowne has worked as both a session musician and band member. His earliest recorded work is with John Cale on Sabotage Live, recorded at CBGB's in 1979. Seeking other musical settings, he left Cale's group and began rehearsing with ex-Television singer/guitarist Tom Verlaine, and guitarist Chris Spedding, when he received a call from Iggy Pop inviting him to join a tour already in progress. Bowne toured extensively with Pop and played the drums on the Party album. During his time in Iggy's band, Bowne continued to meet and play with other artists, including No wave, experimental, the free improvisation and jazz scenes  He performed with Richard Hell as a Voidoid and with James Chance. He was the drummer and percussionist on Lydia Lunch's influential Queen of Siam, co-writing the record's single \"Atomic Bongos,\"and was a member of the group Melon (recording with members of Plastics), and Talking Heads' touring band. He concurrently began to create his own projects; one group featuring guitarist Vernon Reid performed at the legendary Mudd Club. He left Iggy's band in 1981, and soon connected with John Lurie, who was reforming his band, The Lounge Lizards. Bowne joined and remained in the band for over a decade, touring extensively, and recording the albums Live from the Drunken Boat, No Pain for Cakes, Big Heart, and Voice of Chunk. He appeared on the soundtracks composed by Lurie for the Jim Jarmusch films Down by Law and Mystery Train and for the Bette Gordon film Variety. Bowne was a soloist on Teo Macero's recording of his orchestral piece Fusion with The London Philharmonic. He continued to explore other musical outlets, performing with artists such as John Zorn, Paul Bley, Annette Peacock, Percy Jones' Stone Tiger trio with Bill Frisell.\nAfter leaving The Lounge Lizards, Bowne recorded A Question of Time with Jack Bruce and Blazing Away with Marianne Faithfull, the latter also a concert film (Blazing Away) with a band featuring Dr. John, Garth Hudson, Cassandra Wilson (Grammy-winning for New Moon Daughter), Bernie Worrell (Funk of Ages), John S. Hall, Jeremy Tobak, Jeb Loy Nichols, Kazutoki Umezu, and others. Bowne was the drummer for Ryuichi Sakamoto's Beauty world tour, as well for Laurie Anderson on many tours in various group settings. During this time, Bowne performed regularly in Europe and America as a trio with Arto Lindsay and Melvin Gibbs and was a member of Brandon Ross's ensemble, The Overflow, with Melvin Gibbs and Don Byron. He recorded with Cibo Matto, Marc Ribot, Dave Douglas, and Hopi Kamiyama and joined Chris Whitley's band playing drums and co-producing the Din of Ecstasy and Terra Incognita albums. His piano trio, with pianist John Medeski and bassist Fred Hopkins, recorded One Way Elevator, an album of Bowne's compositions that was co-produced by Craig Street and released by DIW Records in late 1996.\nBowne suffered a traumatic brain injury in late 1996, affecting his coordination and limiting his ability to play the drums. After extensive rehabilitation, he concentrated on production and composition, producing and co-writing much of Benny Ibarra's platinum record Todo o Nada. Bowne produced Fayray's Covers and Hikari to Kage, along with records by Trixie Whitley, Doveman, and others, and returned to the drum set the week of 9/11 to play with Chocolate Genius, Marc Ribot, and Yuka Honda, also performing at a benefit for the venue with Yoko Ono, Sean Lennon, Yuka Honda, and Vincent Gallo. On Floored by Four's debut album, Bowne played drums along with bandmates Mike Watt, Yuka Honda, and Nels Cline. The group performed in 2010 at SummerStage in Central Park, New York City.\nBowne has written film scores, notably for Edet Belzberg's Watchers of the Sky and for La Habitacion Azul, and has composed music for dance. Currently, he performs using highly processed electric guitar and percussive objects that combine with electronics to create often dense and layered sonic worlds, which can be heard on I Never Met a Guitar 6 (released September 2022), QUADRILATERE Volume 6, and Never Metaguitar Volume 6, produced by Elliot Sharp. In 2023 he collaborated on the music for the play by Marc Anthony Thompson, The Ni\u00bf\u00bfer Lovers, which opened at The Magic Theater in San Francisco.\nSelected discography\nAs leader\nDougie Bowne One Way Elevator (1997)  Leader, composer, drums.\nDougie Bowne\nAs band member/session musician\nJohn Cale Sabotage (1979) - Drums\nIggy Pop Party (1980) - Drums, percussion\nLydia Lunch Queen of Siam (1980) - Drums, percus",

    "Leendert Gerrit Westerink (2 November 1913 \u2013 24 January 1990) was a Dutch philologist and university professor, emeritus at the Department of Classics of the University of New York at Buffalo.\nHe was a specialist of Ancient Greek philosophical literature in prose, and widely studied its transmission and reception through Late antiquity and Byzantine Empire.\nBiography\nBorn in Velp, he studied at the University of Nimegen, earning his MA in 1939 and his doctorate in 1948. He began his career teaching Ancient Greek, Latin and English at the Emmen high school from 1945 to 1965; in that year he moved to the U.S., having won a professorship at the University at Buffalo where he taught for the rest of his career, becoming Distinguished Professor of Classics in 1974. He was made emeritus upon his retirement in 1988.\nHe married Barbara Wilhelmina Schmidt in 1945 and their marriage lasted until his death in 1990, after a heart stroke.\nResearch activity\nWesterink was a Classicist and a Byzantinist, specializing in Greek philosophical prose. His scientific output is chiefly concerned with textual criticism and the edition of texts. His first major publication being an edition of Psellos' \"De omnifaria doctrina\", he worked mainly on Plato and Neoplatonism, including the Byzantine philosophers and commentators Proclus, Olympiodorus and Damascius.\nOther than that, he studied and published texts by Germanus I of Constantinople, Theophylact Simocatta, Photios, Arethas, the 10th-century rhetor Theodoros Daphnopates, Maximus Planudes, George Pachymeres, and the early 15th-century satirist Mazaris (Mazaris 1975). In parallel, he worked on Greek medical texts and the transmission and reception of ancient medicine, contributing to the edition of the \"Lectures on Galen's De sectis\" by a 6th-century professor of medicine named Agnellus, and publishing the critical texts of the \"Commentaries on Hippocrates' Aphorisms\" by Stephanus of Athens. Germanus' treatise \"On the Predestined Terms of Life\", Simocates' on the same topic, Mazaris' satira and Agnellus' \"Lectures\" were edited co-working with the members of Seminar 609 of the University at Buffalo, and published in the departmental series \"Arethusa Monographs\".\nHe prepared the critical text of several works by Damascius, including the \"Treatise of the First Principles\" (3 vols., 1986\u20131991) and the \"Commentary on Plato's Parmenides\" (published posthumously, 1992) for the Collection Bud\u00e9; in 1973, he edited the letters of the Byzantine statesman Nicetas Magistros (fl. IX-X cen.) for the French CNRS, and those of the Patriarch of Constantinople Nicholas I for the Corpus Fontium Historiae Byzantinae.\nHe also published Arethas' minor works (Arethas 1967\u20131972) and Photios' \"Letters\" and \"Amphilochia\" (theological opuscules) (Photius 1983\u20131988) in the Bibliotheca Teubneriana. One of his last scientific enterprises was the organization and the launch of the critical edition of Michael Psellos' works, also for the Bibliotheca Teubneriana, which he contributed to by editing his poems (Michael Psellus 1992) and preparing a volume of the minor theological writings (Michael Psellus 2002).\nHonors\nWesterink was honored with a Festschrift in 1988 by his friends, scholars and colleagues, the year of his retirement:\nDuffy, J.

    "French botanist and physician (1825\u20131912)\nJean Baptiste Saint-Lager,  born in 1825 in Lyon and died in 1912, was a French botanist and physician. In June 1881, he was made a member of the Academy of Sciences, Belles-Lettres and Arts of Lyon (Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Lyon).\nBackground\nLittle is known of Saint-Lager's early life. Jean Baptiste Saint-Lager began practising medicine in Lyon, after successfully concluding his studies at the Lyon School of Medicine in 1847. In 1850 he worked as a doctor of medicine at the University of Paris, where he remained in this profession for twelve years. In 1862, he began travelling to make collections for his research on both botanical and medical topics, during which time he devoted himself to scientific studies.\nIn his pursuit of academia, he was greatly influenced by Gaspard Adolphe Chatin (1813\u20131901), who laid the foundation for the modern hydrotelluric theory of iodine deficiency, based on the knowledge of iodine's biological cycle. Although Chatin's findings were disputed by scholars representing the biological conservatism of the times, Jean Baptiste Saint-Lager supported Chatin's views and wrote a careful review of 43 different pathogenetic theories of goitre.\nIn Saint-Lager's study of herbaria, he dealt primarily with the process of nomenclature and of plant taxonomy.\nJean Baptiste Saint-Lager is recognized as being one of the founders of the Lyon Botanical Society (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de Lyon) and served as librarian for that society, as well as for the Linnean Society of Lyon until 1911.\nSelected published works\nSaint-Lager, Jean Baptiste (1880). \"R\u00e9forme de la Nomenclature botanique\".

    "5th-century Christian monk and writer\nNot to be confused with Hyperechius of Aspona.\nHyperechios or Hyperechius (Greek: \u1f59\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ad\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) was a Christian ascetic and monastic writer who was active during the late 4th century or early 5th century A.D. He most likely lived in Egypt or Roman Palestine. He is known from the Sayings of the Desert Fathers, as well as a collection of 160 sayings known as the Exhortation to the Monks (Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u0391\u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd, romanized:\u00a0Para\u00ednesis Ask\u0113t\u020fn).\nName\nThe name Hyper\u00e9chios is derived from the Greek hyper\u00e9chein , meaning, \u2018to be above,\u2019 \u2018to rise over,\u2019 or \u2018to transcend.\u2019\nLife\nVery little is known about Hyperechios. Based on his writings, Vivian (2024) deduces that he was from an upper-middle class Greek-speaking family and lived close to an urban setting. He likely lived in a coastal city, which could have been Alexandria, Ashkelon, or even Tyre. Hyperechios would have lived sometime between the late 300s and the Council of Chalcedon in 451 A.D.\nWritings\nThe Exhortation to the Monks (Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u0391\u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd, romanized:\u00a0Para\u00ednesis Ask\u0113t\u020fn) is an alphabetically organized compilation of 160 maxims from Hyperechios. The Greek text of the Exhortation is can be found in the Patrologia Graeca (volume 79, pp. 1472-1489). An English translation was published by Tim Vivian in 2024.\nTirot (1991: 51\u201352) contains 18 more alphabetically organized sayings from MS Vatican grec 440 (12th century) and MS Cambridge, Trinity College, O.9.17 (11th\u201312th century).\nFurther reading\nSmith, James Vaughan (2003).

    "Japanese manga series\nOne Room Angel (Japanese: \u30ef\u30f3\u30eb\u30fc\u30e0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb, Hepburn: Wan R\u016bmu Enjeru) is a Japanese manga series by Harada. It is serialized in the bimonthly boys' love manga magazine On BLUE from October 25, 2017, to December 25, 2018. The series is a remake of Harada's 2013 short story Tomarigi (\u6b62\u307e\u308a\u6728).\nA live-action television drama adaptation was broadcast from October 20, 2023, to November 24, 2023, for Drama Shower, a programming block created MBS in collaboration with Tunku, Kadokawa Corporation's label for live-action boys' love television dramas.\nPlot\nKouki is a convenience store employee with no ambition in life. He lives alone in a shabby one-room apartment and is unable to get another job due to his appearance and past criminal record. One night, while dealing with unruly customers at his job, Kouki is stabbed, but upon falling conscious, he sees an angel fall from the sky. Kouki later finds the angel in his apartment with no memories of his previous life, as well as being unable to fly. The angel claims that his wings can only heal from Kouki's positive emotions and promises to help him get his life back on track in exchange for food and shelter.\nKouki is fired from his job due to the stabbing incident, and the angel attempts to give Kouki advice on finding a new job. Meanwhile, Kouki also seeks financial aid from his estranged mother, Arisa, while sharing how his past criminal jobs wound up with his younger brother, Tomoki, being forced into the yakuza. Later, the angel discovers that he had died from jumping from his home above convenience store on the night Kouki was stabbed, and that no one but Kouki is able to see him.\nAfter talking to the convenience store manager and the angel's father, Kouki and the angel crack the password to the angel's former social media account. Together, they learn that the angel's true name is Takashi Takashina, who had been bullied by a popular boy at his middle school, Boy A. During a class field trip, Boy A had made sexual advances on him, but he later fell from a window by accident and died. Takashi was subsequently blamed for Boy A's death, causing him to later die by suicide. Finding closure with his death, the angel realizes that being with Kouki helps him feel loved and confesses his feelings for him.\nAs Kouki and the angel go on more outings together, one day, the angel suddenly disappears with his wish fulfilled. Kouki falls into depression, but he finds a feather from the angel's wings in his apartment, which makes him realize his relationship with the angel was real and inspires him to move on with his life. He gets a job with a moving company, and he reconciles with Tomoki. Kouki understands that, through his time with the angel, life is worth living. In the epilogue, Kouki reunites with the angel in death.\nCharacters\nKouki (\u5e78\u7d00, K\u014dki)\nVoiced by: Tomokazu Sugita (audio drama), Portrayed by: Shuhei Uesugi (TV drama)\nKouki is a convenience store employee in his 30s who has no direction in life.\nAngel (\u5929\u4f7f, Tenshi)\nVoiced by: Shouta Aoi (audio drama), Portrayed by: Takuya Nishimura\u00a0 (TV drama)\nThe angel is a mysterious boy with wings who has lost his memories and cannot fly.

    "Infantry regiment of the Imperial Russian Army\nMilitary unit\nThe 52nd Vilnius Infantry Regiment of His Imperial Highness Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich is an infantry military unit of the Imperial Russian Army. It was part of the 13th Infantry Division.\nFormation and campaigns\nThe infantry regiment was formed on 29 October 1811 from the companies of the Uglich infantry and Moscow, Arkhangelsk and Kazan garrison regiments.\nFor participation in the Patriotic War of 1812 and War of the Sixth Coalition, the regiment was awarded the \"campaign for military distinction\". On 14 February 1831, one battalion of the Vilnius Regiment was separated to form the Prague Infantry Regiment, which was replaced by a battalion of the Yaroslavl Regiment.\nOn 28 January 1833, the 1st and 3rd battalions of the 48th Jaeger Regiment were added to the infantry formation, and the Vilnius Regiment was renamed into a Jaeger Regiment. On 22 February 1845, the regiment was assigned a battalion of the Jaeger Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich Regiment, and on 16 December of the same year, the 2nd and 3rd battalions were detached from the regiment to form the Kuban Jaeger Regiment.\nOn 14 November 1853, the regiment defeated the Ottomans at Akhaltsikhe, for which it was awarded the St. George Banner with the corresponding inscription. For its participation in the Crimean War, the regiment was awarded badges on its headdresses with the inscription - for the 1st and 2nd battalions: \"For distinction in 1854 and 1855\", for the 3rd and 4th battalions: \"For distinction in 1853, 1854 and 1855.\"\nOn 17 April 1856, the regiment was redesignated an infantry regiment. On 25 March 1865, the troop number 52 was added to the regiment's name, and from 30 September 1876 to 5 October 1905, the regiment's chief was Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, who was again appointed chief of the Vilnius Regiment on April 14, 1909.\nFrom 4 December 1873, the regiment was stationed in Feodosia, in the rifle barracks on Voennaya (now Viti Korobkova) Street. The transfer was carried out gradually, initially the camp assembly was near Kerch, and the general divisional assembly near Sevastopol. Only the headquarters and two battalions were stationed in Feodosia. Later, after the entire regiment was transferred to Feodosia, it was allocated two barracks complexes for accommodation - the so-called \"gray\" barracks (Fedko Street, house No. 38) and the \"Vilno\" barracks (Viti Korobkova Boulevard, house No. 14), as well as the buildings of the bankrupt mechanical establishment of engineer Maslyannikov, converted to accommodate the regimental supply train. From 7 to 11 companies of the regiment were housed in the \"gray\" barracks at different times.\nDuring the Russo-Turkish War, the regiment guarded the Crimean coast from Feodosia to Sudak. During peacetime, the regiment played a major role in the public life of Feodosia, organized parades on holidays, the regiment's orchestra played on the city boulevard during public festivities (on Sundays, Tchaikovsky's ceremonial overture \"The Year 1812\" was always performed, accompanied by the ringing of bells and pistol shots), the regiment's officers were eligible bachelors in the city.\nOn 23 June 1905, the 2nd company of the regiment fired on the Potemkin, which was loading coal in the Feodosia port, after which the ship weighed anchor and sailed to the shores of Romania.\nDuring the Russian Revolution of 1905, individual companies of the regiment were repeatedly called upon to disperse strikes and demonstrations in the Taurida Governorate.\nIn August 1914, as part of the 13th Infantry Division, the regiment left for the front of World War I. The regiment participated in the Battle of Yanchinsky and Brusilov Offensive.\nRussian Revolution and Civil War\n\"Grey\" barracks of the Vilnius regiment. Feodosia, Fedko street 38, to date a military unit\nThe regiment began to disintegrate after the publication of Order No. 1 and agitation by socialist parties. In the spring of 1917, the regiment's royal titles were stripped and the regiment's reserves refused to obey orders to the front. Later, the soldiers were finally persuaded to obey the order.\nThe regiment was disbanded after the October Revolution. Many of the regiment's servicemen returned to Feodosia. Some of them formed the Union of St. George Cavaliers and participated in the April uprising, which was suppressed by the Bolsheviks.\nThe regiment was revived in December 1918 in the Armed Forces of South Russia and the Army of Wrangel. It was part of the 13th Division of the 2nd Army Corps. Initially, in October 1918, the Vilnius residents were part of the Combined Crimean Infantry Regiment, then they formed a company in the combined battalion of the 13th Infantry Division. In February, they were already fighting at Perekop, in March, with the partisans in the Feodosia district, then, at the Ak-Monay positions.\nOn 18 June\u00a0, the Vilnius Regiment landed on the Kagul near Koktebel, attacking Red Army units from t",

    "Olga Vasilievna Evdokimova (in Russian: \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0415\u0432\u0434\u043e\u043a\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430) (11 July 1896 in Novorozhdestvenska - 10 February 1938 in the Gulag) is a Russian Eastern Orthodox martyr and saint. After defending the church in her village of Novorozhdestvenska against closure imposed by Soviet authorities, she was arrested by the NKVD, interrogated, and then deported to the Gulag, where she died four months after her arrival. She is recognized by the Eastern Orthodox Church with the title of martyr, and her memory is celebrated on January 28.\nShe should not be confused with the contemporary martyr, Olga Semyonovna Kosheleva.\nBiography\nYouth and marriage\nOlga Evdokimova was born on 11 July 1896, in the village of Novorozhdestvenska, in the Moscow oblast. Her father was a forest ranger on the estate of the wealthy landowner Ilyn, and she married in 1905, at the age of 8 or 9. Her marriage took place during the Russo-Japanese War. Evdokimova obtained a diploma from the communal school, her husband became a worker in a factory, and later a guard, and she had two children.\nUSSR and death\nIn 1921, her husband died, and she became a widow. She became involved in her parish \"Saint John the Baptist\" in Novorozhdestvenska, which had been her parish since childhood. On 4 September 1937, Evdokimova was arrested by the NKVD along with the priests, a psalmist, and the church guard. She was transferred to Taganka prison in Moscow and interrogated the same day. During her interrogation, she reportedly stated that she had consciously chosen to oppose the atheist Soviet authorities for their decision to close her church. She was specifically accused of hiding the church keys to prevent the authorities from seizing the building.\nOn 17 October 1937, the NKVD sentenced her to 10 years of forced labor in a re-education camp, and she was deported there.

    "\nPenny Singer is a Din\u00e9 (Navajo) clothing designer who creates wearable art.\nBiography\nPenny Singer was born in Teec Nos Pos, Arizona to Din\u00e9 parents. They were a military family, and moved every few years. Singer's mother taught her to sew when she was seven. She attended Highland High School in Gilbert, Arizona.\nSinger won a scholarship to Haskell Indian Nations University. Her boyfriend needed a ribbon shirt for powwow regalia, so she made one for him.  In 1992, Singer transferred the Institute of American Indian Arts to study photography and documentary film. where she studied traditional design techniques, particularly southwest appliqu\u00e9 styles. Singer graduated from college in 1996. After graduating, Singer returned to fashion design,  showing her first pieces at Indian Market in 1999. Singer's appliqu\u00e9 grew stronger as she created and used her stencils.\nSinger began producing and selling ribbon shirts at markets like the Santa Fe Indian Market. In 2023, they were displayed at the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts Native Fashion Week.\nWork\nSinger considers her work \"wearable art\". She makes clothing ranging from dancing regalia to jackets. A 2024 article in Vogue noted that she specializes in handcrafted ribbon shirts. Singer's work combines her artistic media. For example, she will use photographs printed on fabric for patchwork. She uses art by other artists as well, like buttons created by Navajo silversmiths Michael Roanhorse and Jennifer Curtis. Her work draws inspiration from her life and Navajo design.\nSinger's work mainly includes jackets, shirts, and purses, but also includes wall hangings, dance regalia, and other clothing.\nAwards\nThis is a partial list of awards:\n2023: Southwestern Association for Indian Arts, Garments, Second Place\n2009: Native American Clothing Contest, Honorable Mention\n2007: Southwestern Association for Indian Arts Fellowship Award\n2007: Southwestern Association for Indian Arts, Contemporary Clothing, Second Place\n2007: Southwestern Association for Indian Arts,  Native American Clothing Contest, Third Place\n2005: The 47th Annual Heard Museum Guild Indian Fair & Market, Quilts, Best of Division\n2004: Native American Clothing Contest, Honorable Mention\nReferences\n^ a b \"Swaia Honors Artists\".

    "Adriana Georgescu-Cosmovici (July 23, 1920 \u2013 October 29, 2005) was a political prisoner and memoirist from Romania, who emigrated to Western Europe in 1948.\nBiography\nBorn in Bucharest, Adriana Georgescu completed her secondary studies in 1939 at the Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu High School. After graduating in 1944 from the Faculty of Law of the University of Bucharest, she became the private secretary of General Nicolae R\u0103descu. After the fall of the R\u0103descu government on February 28, 1945, she was arrested on July 29 of that year; held at Malmaison Prison in Bucharest, she was subjected to rape and torture. In her memoirs, she recounted the manner in which she had been tortured by a team of which Alexandru Nicolschi was a member, and indicated that the latter had been one of the three to have threatened her with guns. She also detailed various torture methods (including vicious beatings of detainees) Nicolschi personally engaged in during interrogations at Malmaison Prison. After a trial (where she detailed the torture and rape she endured during interrogation), she was sentenced in September 1945 to 4 years of prison for \"plotting against the social order\". She was pardoned by King Michael I in April 1947. Rearrested in August of that year, she was released after a few weeks of investigation.\nOn August 2, 1948, she managed to leave Romania clandestinely, together with her future husband, \u0218tefan Cosmovici, taking refuge in Vienna, then in Paris. Later, she became a correspondent for Radio Free Europe (1952\u20131957 and 1965\u20131967) and BBC Radio's Romanian section. After marrying the English officer and author Frank Lorimer Westwater, she became a citizen of the Great Britain in 1961. She died in London at age 85.\nWorks\nAu commencement \u00e9tait la fin: la dictature rouge \u00e0 Bucarest, (Paris: Hachette, 1951)\n1951: La \u00eenceput a fost sf\u00e2r\u0219itul, published in Romania by Humanitas Publishing House, 1992, and Cultural Foundation Memoria, 1999.

    "Nigerian Yoruba writer\nOladejo Okediji (born 1929 in Oyo, died March 17, 2019; Yoruba: \u1eccl\u00e1d\u1eb9\u0300j\u1ecd \u00d2k\u00e8d\u00ecj\u00ed) was a Nigerian writer, novelist, and playwright. He authored several works in Yoruba language and pioneered crime fiction genre in Yoruba literature with his 1969 novel \u00c0j\u00e0 L\u00f3 L'\u1eb9r\u00f9.\nPersonal life and career\nOkediji had his primary education at went to Methodist School, Apaara, and St Andrew's Primary School from 1935 and 1943. He then had a stint as a teacher at St Andrew's before entering Wesley College, Ibadan where be had his secondary education from 1945 to 1948.\nIn 1954, Nigeria's Western Regional Literature Committee advertised for entries into a creative writing programme in Yoruba. Okediji entered for the competition with what would become his first published work, \u00c0j\u00e0 L\u00f3 L'\u1eb9r\u00f9. This call was what spurred Okediji to write in Yoruba language. He had actually drafted his manuscript in English language: \"The Big Buffoon\", later translated as \u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 Ak\u00e0n.\nInfluenced by the works of Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle, Okediji pioneered the detective fiction writing in Yoruba language, creating the detective character, L\u00e1p\u00e0d\u00e9, in his first two novels, \u00c0j\u00e0 L\u00f3 L'\u1eb9r\u00f9 (1969) and \u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 Ak\u00e0n (1971). After the duology, Okediji was encouraged by Ola Rotimi to also try writing plays in Yoruba language. it was as a result of that nudge that he published of R\u1eb9r\u1eb9 Run, which has been translated in French as Catastrophe au rendezvous. After some three decades, published K\u00e1 r\u00ecn k\u00e1 p\u1ecd\u0300 (2007) as a sequel to his L\u00e1p\u00e0d\u00e9 crime thriller series extending it to a trilogy.\nAlmost all of Okediji's works have been prescribed as school texts in Nigeria for WASSCE and in Nigerian universities, and his novels have been serialized in newspapers and on the radio. His plays have also been staged and adapted into movies by various film directors and cinematographers.\nFrom 1958 to 1961, Okediji ventured into politics, and served as a counselor in Oyo. He is the father of Nigerian painter and art historian Moyo Okediji. Oladejo Okediji died in March 2019, and was buried in Apaara, Oyo, his hometown, on 19 April 2019.\nAnthology\n\u00c0j\u00e0 L\u00f3 L'\u1eb9r\u00f9 (1969)\n\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 Ak\u00e0n (1971)\n\u1ecc\u0300g\u00e1 ni B\u00f9k\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e1 (1972)\nR\u1eb9r\u1eb9 Run (1973)\nOw\u00f3 \u1eb8\u0300j\u1eb9\u0300 (1976)\n\u00ccm\u00fara \u00ccd\u00e1nw\u00f3 Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 (1978)\nAt\u00f3t\u00f3 Ar\u00e9re (1981)\n\u1e62\u00e0\u01f9g\u00f3 (1987)\n\u1ecc\u0300p\u00e1 \u00c0gb\u00e9l\u00e9k\u00e0 (1989)\nB\u00edn\u00fa Ti R\u00ed (1989)\n\u00ccr\u00f2y\u00ecn Ay\u1ecd\u0300\nA\u00e1j\u00f2 Aj\u00e9 (1997)\nRunning After Riches (English translation of A\u00e1j\u00f2 Aj\u00e9, trans. by Okediji and Karin Barber, 1999)\nK\u00e1 r\u00ecn k\u00e1 p\u1ecd\u0300 (2007)\n\u00c0\u00e1r\u00f2 \u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301m\u1ecdge (2014)\nOh\u00f9n \u1eb8nu \u00c0gb\u00e0 - a collection of poems (2018)\nReferences\n^ \"Legendary Yoruba writer, Oladejo Okediji, dies at 89\".

    "The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club was involved in a number of criminal allegations and incidents in Nova Scotia between 1984 and 2003.\nOrigins\nOn 5 December 1984, the Thirteenth Tribe biker gang of Halifax led by David Carroll \"patched over\" to become the first Hells Angels chapter in Atlantic Canada. Unlike the other Hells Angels chapters, the Halifax chapter was very much dependent upon the chapters from Quebec in order to function. In 1984, Allan \"the Weasel\" Ross, the boss of the West End Gang, told the Hells Angels Yves Trudeau that he was willing to forgive the drug debts owned to him by the Halifax chapter in exchange for the Halifax chapter paying Trudeau money that Ross owned him. Carroll paid Trudeau $98, 000 dollars, only to learn that Trudeau was entitled to one-quarter of what he had paid. Carroll along with R\u00e9jean Lessard planned the so-called Lennoxville massacre ad Carroll along with several members of the Halifax chapter were present at the massacre. In May 1986, Carroll along with the rest of the Halifax chapter were arrested for living off the anvils of prostitution. Hells Angels rules require that all chapters must have at least six active members at any given moment, and the mass arrest threatened to have charter of the Halifax chapter pulled. A number of Hells Angels from British Columbia went out to Halifax to serve for two week intervals until the Halifax chapter finished their prison sentences.\nHeyday of the Halifax chapter\nIn 1990, Carroll moved to Montreal to join the Montreal chapter, but remained closely involved in the Halifax chapter, which he visited on a regular basis. According to the police informer Dany Kane, between April and November 1996 Caroll shipped 30 kilograms of cocaine from Montreal to Halifax. Carroll had a low opinion of the Halifax chapter, whom he disparaged as \"a bunch of Boy Scouts\". The only member of the Halifax chapter whom Carroll respected was Mike McCrea, the chapter president who rose to become the world secretary of the Hells Angels. Besides for McCrea, the person whom Carroll saw the most in Halifax was Paul Wilson, the owner of the Reflections gay bar. Wilson was charged with money laundering in 1998 after the police found $294, 010 in cash on him after a roadside stop. In February 1997, Carroll sent Kane along with his lover Aim\u00e9 Simard to Halifax to kill a locally prominent businessman Robert MacFarlane. ON 27 February 1997, Kane and Simard shot and killed MacFarlane in a Halifax industrial park. Kane was to later claimed that Wilson had paid for the murder of MacFarlane.\nThe journalists Julian Sher and William Marsden wrote the Halifax chapter was \"not an impressive crew\". Mike \"Speedy\" Christiansen spent 10 years in prison after his conviction for rape as he joined several bikers in gang-raping a 16-year-old girl in 1971. Danny Fitzsimmons, the sergeant-at-arms, was convicted of assault after he attacked a cameraman for CBC News. The other prominent members of the chapter were Neil \"Nasty\" Smith and Clay McRea, the younger brother of Mike McCrea. In 1998, a \"full patch\" member of the Halifax chapter, Gregory Brushett, vanished and is believed to have been murdered by his fellow Angels to prevent him from turning Crown's evidence after he was convicted of three counts of cocaine trafficking.\nRandy Mersereau, a member of the Halifax chapter broke away in 1998 to found his own gang under the grounds: \"I'm here to make money. I'm not making money as a Hells Angel\". Mersereau was one of the founding members of the Halifax chapter who been convicted of the same 1971 gang rape that Chirstiansen had been involved in. Another gang allied to the Hells Angels were the Marriot brothers, Billy and Ricky, of Spryfield. Kane reported to his police handers: \"Carroll is very disappointed by the leadership exercised by the Hells Angels in Halifax. Caroll wanted to take control of the drug trade in that city, but feared that the HA in Halifax didn't have what it takes to do the job. It was time to shake things up\". In October 1998, a Hells Angel associate, William Wendelborg, was murdered. Later courtroom testimony stated that Wendelborg was killed by Billy Marriot and Larry Pace in a murder paid for by Wilson. Ricky Marriot along with his wife, Gail Marriot, were found murdered inside of their house on 20 November 1998. Pace pleaded guilty to being an accessory to murder with regards to Wendelborg's slaying while Billy Marriot facing charges of first degree murder for killing his own brother hanged himself in his jail cell on 7 August 2000.\nThe Port of Halifax\nThe port of Halifax was a center of drug smuggling and between 1991 and 2003, the police seized $2.5 billion worth of drugs at the port. Numerous employees at the port had Hells Angels ties. Sidney Peckford, the director of the Ports Police in Halifax said: \"I knew them all-I knew their faces. I knew what they were involved in. Nobody was prepared to muscle them around because they didn't know what reperc",

    "Historic restaurant in Haenam County, South Korea\nCheonil Sikdang (Korean:\u00a0\ucc9c\uc77c\uc2dd\ub2f9) is a historic restaurant in Haenam County, South Jeolla Province, South Korea. It the seventh-oldest operating restaurant in South Korea, having been established in 1924. It specializes in Korean table d'h\u00f4te (hanjeongsik): a large spread of numerous small Korean side dishes.\nThe restaurant has reportedly been consistently famous in South Jeolla Province and across South Korea, and has remained family-owned. It was reportedly frequented by significant politicians in the country, and its food was delivered to the South Korean presidential residence the Blue House a number of times. The restaurant now has a branch in Seoul called Haenam Cheonilgwan (\ud574\ub0a8\ucc9c\uc77c\uad00) was opened in the mid-1990s.\nDescription\nThe restaurant is reportedly reputed for its tteok-galbi (short rib patties) and kimchi. It reportedly serves dozens of side dishes at each table. The restaurant claims to have no secret recipes, and only focuses on the quality of its ingredients and execution of its cooking.\nHistory\nThe restaurant was first established in 1924 as Cheonilgwan (\ucc9c\uc77c\uad00) by Park Seong-sun (\ubc15\uc131\uc21c; \u6734\u6210\u9806). She was the breadwinner for her family, as her yangban husband reportedly had little interest in working. She set up a roadside food stall and began selling a variety of namul dishes and soups. Her stand reportedly became popular, with even local officials seeking it out. As eating at such a stall was inconvenient, they asked her to create a restaurant building. That became Cheonilgwan. The original location of the restaurant is located within the innermost part of the current complex; it was a thatched-roof hanok building. As hanjeongsik was prohibitively expensive for regular people around this time, its customers were mainly aristocrats.\nIn 1950, the original hut was torn down and replaced with a more modern building. After the second generation Lee Jeong-rye (\uc774\uc815\ub840; \u674e\u6b63\u79ae) took over the restaurant, she changed its name to Cheonil Sikdang. Around that time, tteok-galbi became the restaurant's signature dish. Park would eventually die in 1973. Lee died in 1990; in 1988 Oh Hyeon-hwa (\uc624\ud604\ud654; \u5433\u8ce2\u83ef) took over.\nSince early in its history, the restaurant has been consistently popular among the elite in South Korea. South Korean leader Park Chung Hee ate at the restaurant four times. The food has reportedly been delivered to the South Korean former presidential residence the Blue House on a number of occasions. Reportedly, on one occasion Park Seong-sun refused to go by car to the Blue House because she would easily get carsick, so Park Chung Hee offered her a helicopter ride to Seoul. South Korean leader Ahn Woo-man\u00a0, Minister of Justice, dined at the restaurant in 1995. Mayor of Seoul Goh Kun ate there in 1997. In spite of this, the restaurant's customer base is reportedly diverse, with various socioeconomic classes eating together.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f \uae40, \uc720\uc131 (July 3, 2023). \"\uc8fc\uc778\ub3c4 \uc190\ub2d8\ub3c4 3\ub300\uc9f8\u2026\uc804\uad6d 7\ubc88\uc9f8 \uc624\ub798\ub41c \uc2dd\ub2f9\". \ud574\ub0a8\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc2e0\ubb38 (in Korean).

    "Last battle of the First Indochina War\nThe Battle of Chu-Dreh Pass also known as the Ambush at Chu-Dreh Pass and Operation Myosotis was the last battle of the First Indochina War between French and Viet Minh forces that took place on July 17, 1954, within the Central Highlands of French Indochina. It ended with the French battle group, 'Groupement Mobile No. 42' suffering heavy losses and the near destruction of the veteran Cor\u00e9e battalion. This was the last battle of the war with the Geneva ceasefire taking effect just three days later.\nBackground\nFurther information: Battle of Mang Yang Pass\nOn November 15, 1953, the French regimental task force unit of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps 'Groupement Mobile No. 100' (\"Mobile Group 100\" or GM.100) which included the elite veteran UN 'Bataillon de Cor\u00e9e' (I/Cor\u00e9e) that had fought in the Korean War was transferred to French Indochina.\nOn June 24 the following year, not long after the surrender of the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu the French Chief of Staff ordered GM.100 to abandon its defensive positions at An Khe and fall back to Pleiku, some 50 miles away over Route Coloniale 19 code named op\u00e9ration \u00c9glantine. GM.100, however were hit in a series of deadly ambushes, suffering heavy losses in men and vehicles by 29 June. They fell back to the safer Pleiku where they reorganized and re-equipped with the help of 'Groupement Mobile No. 42' (GM.42).\nOn June 29, the French headquarters in the coastal town of Nha Trang had received intelligence that the Viet Minh had infiltrated the area along Route Coloniale 14 between Pleiku and Ban M\u00ea Thu\u1ed9t. 'Groupement Mobile No. 42' (GM.42) led by veteran Lieutenant Colonel Jacques Sockeel, were to be sent out on Operation Myosotis (Forget-Me-Not) with orders to keep the road open. They were also to relieve an outpost held by a company of regular troops and some thirty guerrillas 85\u00a0km South of Pleiku. GM.42 was composed of three mountaineer infantry battalions (which included Montagnards). There was also the 4th Vietnamese Artillery Group, the two remaining companies of I/Cor\u00e9e and a reinforced armoured platoon of the Third Squadron of the 5th (\"Royal Poland\") Cuirassiers Armoured Cavalry.\nAmbush\nOn Bastille Day, July 14, the task force took to the road, and two days later at dusk, the various units had reached Ea H'leo. The French having learned some of the lessons from Mang Yang Pass had prepared themselves in case of another ambush - the artillery were pushed up to support the front units, while infantry units and vehicles established temporary defensive positions. The artillery themselves would be supported by tanks when they moved up. In addition, they would have aerial support from B-26 fighter bombers flying from bases in Nha Trang.\nThe following day the GM.42's column was passing through areas of potential ambush sites, but nothing was seen, and no attacks took place. As they approached the dangerous Chu Dreh Pass, the Montagnard infantry slowly got through without trouble, while I/Cor\u00e9e and the artillery formed the rearguard. At 10.50am, they had left the southern end of the pass when the 8th Montagnard battalion and the Brigade HQ of I/Cor\u00e9e were suddenly attacked by the Viet Minh. These were local units from the 96th Regiment which opened up on the convoy with 81mm mortars, 60mm's, and recoil less cannons.\nThe Viet Minh managed to create choke points at both the northern and southern ends of the pass. The soft skinned vehicles were targeted and soon a dozen trucks were blazing between the ends of the pass. Two companies of the 8th Montagnard battalion and the 4th company of I/Cor\u00e9e were destroyed within an hour. Other units around the choke points of the ambush were trying to fight their way out Northwards by leap frogging, and at the same time dragging their wounded. Most of the French radios were knocked out causing chaos and confusion. It meant that on the south side of the pass, the rest of GM.42 not realising what was going on further up, were attempting to stave off an ambush there. They managed to call in air support from B-26 fighter bombers, which eventually managed to help their situation. Nevertheless, the 5th (Royal Poland) Cuirassiers' tanks and vehicles meanwhile arrived at the pass not realising the plight of their cohorts and they too became hit hard.\nThe Viet Minh then stormed the vehicles with infantry in the hope of capturing their guns and radio sets. Soon they were crawling over the armoured vehicles and tanks. The 'Royal Poland' however despite the heavy losses they had sustained did save I/Cor\u00e9e from being completely wiped out.\nBy 14:00 the Viet Minh broke off their attack satisfied with the destruction they had inflicted. The French managed to withdrew but it took some time for the survivors who managed to escape the slaughter to arrive at Bu\u00f4n Ma Thu\u1ed9t. All had arrived by 25 July.\nAftermath\nWhen the survivors finally arrived at Bu\u00f4n Ma Thu\u1ed9t, they counted the cost - GM.42 overall h",

    "\nMilitary unit\nThe King's County Royal Rifle Militia was an Irish Militia regiment in King's County (now County Offaly) dating back to 1776. It later became a battalion of the Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians). It saw action during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and the Second Boer War, and trained thousands of reinforcements during World War I. It was disbanded in 1922.\nBackground\nAlthough there are scattered references to town guards in 1584, no organised militia existed in Ireland before 1660. After that date, some militia forces were organised in the reign of King Charles II: in 1683 Sir Lawrence Parsons, 1st Baronet of Birr Castle, was appointed to command all the militia in King's County. It was not until 1715 that the Irish Militia came under statutory authority. During the 18th Century there were various Volunteer Associations and unofficial militia units controlled by the landowners, concerned mainly with internal security. During the War of American Independence, the threat of invasion by the Americans' allies, France and Spain, appeared to be serious. While most of the Regular Army was fighting overseas, the coasts of England and Wales were defended by the embodied Militia, but Ireland had no equivalent force. The Parliament of Ireland passed a Militia Act, but this failed to create an effective force. However it opened the way for the paramilitary Irish Volunteers to fill the gap. Sir Lawrence Parsons (grandson of the above) commanded the mounted militia Troop in King's County. The county also had the Parsonstown Loyal Independent Volunteer Corps raised at Birr in 1776.\nThe Volunteers were outside the control of either the parliament or the Dublin Castle administration. When the invasion threat receded they diminished in numbers but remained a political force. On the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War In 1793, the Irish administration passed an effective Militia Act that created an official Irish Militia, while the paramilitary volunteers were essentially banned. The new Act was based on existing English precedents, with the men conscripted by ballot to fill county quotas (paid substitutes were permitted) and the officers having to meet certain property qualifications.\nKing's County Militia\nThe Parsonstown Volunteers were placed on the militia establishment in 1793 as the King's County Royal Rifle Militia under the command of Sir Lawrence Parsons, 5th Baronet, later 2nd Earl of Rosse. King's County was given a quota of 420 men to fill, in eight companies.  Henry Peisley L'Estrange took over as Colonel of the Regiment from 2 April 1798.\nFrench Revolutionary War and Irish Rebellion\nThe French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars saw the British and Irish militia embodied for a whole generation, becoming regiments of full-time professional soldiers (though restricted to service in Britain or Ireland respectively), which the regular army increasingly saw as a prime source of recruits. They served in coast defences, manned garrisons, guarded prisoners of war, and carried out internal security duties.\nThe King's County regiment served mainly in the south and west of Ireland in the early part of the war. In August 1794 it was quartered with three companies at Killarney and Ross Castle, two at Tralee, two at Dingle and one at Castleisland. The Irish Militia was augmented in 1795, King's County's quota being increased to 612 men.\nAnxiety about a possible French invasion grew during the autumn of 1796 and preparations were made for field operations. A large French expeditionary force appeared in Bantry Bay on 21 December and troops from all over Ireland were marched towards the threatened area. However, the French fleet was scattered by winter storms, several ships being wrecked, and none of the French troops succeeded in landing; there was no sign of a rising by the United Irishmen. The invasion was called off on 29 December, and the troop concentration was dispersed in early 1797. At the same time the Light companies were detached to join composite battalions drawn from several militia regiments; the King's County company joined the 1st Battalion. When the militiamen of 1793 reached the end of their four-year enlistment in 1797, most of the Irish regiments were able to maintain their numbers through re-enlistments (for a bounty). At the time of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 the strength of the militia was boosted by further re-enlistments and recruiting for bounty rather than the ballot.\nThe men of the King's County Militia were predominantly Roman Catholic, and at the time of the rebellion were not fully trusted by the authorities. However, part of the regiment was in action at Newtownbarry (now known as the Battle of Bunclody) in King's County, where Col L'Estrange had 230 of his King's County Militia, a troop of Dragoons and about 100 Yeomanry Cavalry under his command. With this force he successfully defended the town from attack on 1 June, after which the King's County Militia was",

    "1973 film directed by Douglas N. Schwartz\n Your Three Minutes Are Up  is a 1973 American road movie starring Beau Bridges and Ron Leibman.\nPlot\nCharlie is a sad sack of a man, working at a depressingly dull office job and stuck in a passionless engagement to a neurotic woman. One of the few bright spots in his life is his friend Mike, who seems to be living a life of carefree bohemianism. When the two end up on a long road trip together, they are forced to re-examine their lives and worldviews. Mike may have independence in some ways, but it has come at a price. Charlie, in turn, may feel trapped, but how much of the trap is of his own making? \nCast\nBeau Bridges as Charlie\nRon Leibman as Mike\nJanet Margolin as Betty\nKathleen Freeman as Mrs. Wilk\nDavid Ketchum as Mr. Kellogg\nStuart Nisbet as Dr. Claymore\nRead Morgan as Eddie Abruzzi\nSherry Bain as Sugar\nJune Fairchild as Sandi\nLarry Gelman as Mr. Roberts\nLynne Marie Stewart as Ibis Lady\nNedra Volz as Free Press Lady\nProduction\nThe film was based on an original screenplay by actor James Dixon, who would go on to a long collaboration with filmmaker Larry Cohen as both actor and screenwriter. Director Douglas Schwartz would work extensively in television, where he would become best known as the creator of the long-running series Baywatch.\nThe film was mostly ignored when it came out in August 1973, but reviews were largely positive. Writing in The Washington Post, critic Gary Arnold called it \u201ca surprisingly bright and enjoyable comedy, with serious undertones \u2026 The material takes funnier turns and develops more dramatic intensity than one anticipates.\u201d In his Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin wrote that it was an \u201cunpretentious film  says more about our society than many more \u2018important\u2019 movies.\u201d\nReferences\n^ a b \"Your Three Minutes Are Up\".

    "\n2003 monument in Amsterdam, Netherlands\nTree of Life, Monument of Awareness\nThe Tree of Life, Monument of Awareness (Bon Fu Gron Prakseri) is a monument located at Surinameplein in Amsterdam-West, commemorating the history of slavery, the abolition of Dutch slavery, and the solidarity among the countries that were part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The monument was designed by Henry Renfurm. It was unveiled on June 30, 2003.\nHistory\nOn July 1, 1863, slavery was abolished in the Kingdom of the Netherlands through the Emancipation Act, affecting Suriname and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Cura\u00e7ao, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Saba. To commemorate this, people have gathered annually since 1993 at Surinameplein in Amsterdam on June 30 for a ceremony called the National Day of Awareness. One of the initiators was journalist and broadcaster Roy Ristie from the Comit\u00e9 30 juni/1 juli in Amsterdam. The committee, in line with the Comit\u00e9 4 and 5 May, chose June 30 as a day of reflection and July 1 as a day of celebration.\nThe Tree of Life was unveiled a year after the National Slavery Monument was unveiled on July 1, 2002, in Oosterpark in Amsterdam. The Comit\u00e9 30 juni/1 juli Amsterdam found the location in Oosterpark unsuitable and thus worked towards establishing the Tree of Life, Monument of Awareness at Surinameplein, where the annual commemoration had already been held for ten years. In other municipalities, 30 June/1 July committees have also been established to organize activities leading up to or on June 30 and July 1.\nDesign and symbolism\nThe monument's design emerged from ideas contributed by people from various communities.  The tree of life symbolizes the desire to move forward together. The trunk of the tree represents the ethnic diversity of the community, and the foliage symbolizes the respective countries and their interconnectedness.\nOn the Day of Awareness, two minutes of silence are observed, speeches are given, and wreaths are laid.\nSee also\nList of slavery monuments in the Netherlands\nHistory of Dutch slavery\nReferences\n^ \"Monument van besef\". www.buitenbeeldinbeeld.nl.

    "River in Bulgaria\nThe Stakevska reka (Bulgarian: \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0430) is a river in northwestern Bulgaria, a left tributary of the Lom, itself a right tributary of the Danube. Its length is 34\u00a0km.\nGeography\nThe river takes its source under the name Zheleznata reka at an altitude of 1,300\u00a0m about a kilometer northwest of the summit of Haydushki Kamak (1,721\u00a0m), the highest peak in the Sveti Nikola section of the northwestern part of the Balkan Mountains. It flows north in a deep forested valley until the village of Stakevtsi and after the junction of the road to the village of Krachimir, the river turns east and crosses the Vedernik ridge. After the junction to Belogradchik, it turns southeast and then east, flowing in a wide valley. Some 1.2\u00a0km before its mouth it is joined by its largest tributary, the Chuprenska reka. The river flows into the Lom at an altitude of 218\u00a0m at the village of Yanyovets.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 328\u00a0km2, or 26.5% of the Lom's total. The river has predominantly snow\u2013rain feed. The average annual discharge at the village of Borovitsa is 2\u00a0m3/s.\nSettlements and tourism\nThe Stakevska reka flows entirely in Vidin Province. There are three villages along its course, Stakevtsi, Chiflik and Borovitsa, all of them in Belogradchik Municipality. For 10.2\u00a0km upstream from its mouth, its left bank is followed by a stretch of the third class III-102 road Dimovo\u2013Belogradchik\u2013Montana. Just north of the river at Chiflik span the Belogradchik Rocks, a system of sandstone and conglomerate rock formations, a major tourist attraction and a contender in the New 7 Wonders of the World campaign of 2007. A waterfall along the Stakevska reka at the Belata Voda locality has been declared a natural landmark in 1976.\nCitations\n^ a b c d Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria 1980, p.\u00a0464\n^ \"A Map of the Republican Road Network of Bulgaria\".

    "\nCanike (late 14th century \u2013 1437) was a Crimean princess from the Chingissid dynasty. She was the daughter of the Khan Tokhtamysh and the wife of Emir Edigu. In 1416 she made a pilgrimage to Mecca, gaining her fame in the Muslim world. She played an important role in the separation of the Crimean Khanate from the Golden Horde. She supported the future first Crimean Khan, Hac\u0131 I Giray, in the fight against K\u00fcch\u00fck Muhammad and Sayid Ahmad I. When she died in 1437 she was buried in a specially built mausoleum with the title \"Great Empress.\"\nBiography\nCanike was most likely born in the late 14th century in Crimea. Her father was Tokhtamysh, who was the Khan of the Golden Horde from 1379 to 1380. Almost nothing is known for certain about her childhood, but it is known that she was her father's favorite daughter.\nAfter her father Tokhtamysh was defeated by Timur, her marriage to Edigu caused Edigu's influence over Tokhtamysh grew, since it caused Tokhtamysh to have family ties to Edigu's family.\nIn 1397, Edigu suddenly changed his alliance from Tokhtamysh to Timur, who was at war with him at the time. Enraged, Tokhtamysh killed Canike's mother Togaybek in a fit of rage. Tokhtamysh's political influence declined by the end of the 14th century.\nIn 1406, Edigu captured Khwarazm. In 1411 to 1412, Canike's brother Jalal al-Din tried to besiege Khwarazm, but ultimately failed. As Canike wanted to increase her own political influence in the Golden Horde, she famously made Hajj to Mecca in 1416. Her arrival in Damascus attracted considerable attention from the Arab population, since she was accompanied by 300 horsemen.\nCanike used her influence to convince her husband to spare her brother, three-year-old Qadir Berdi; Edigu wanted to kill him so that only his son would be a legitimate claimant to the throne of the Golden Horde. And eleven years later, Qadir Berdi became the Khan of the Golden Horde at the age of fourteen and then led an army against Edigu. Edigu died in the ensuing battle, and Qadir Berdi died of wounds three days later, leaving Canike the eldest of the Tokhtamysh clan who could claim the throne in Kyrk-Ore.\nIn the context of all the strife in the Golden Horde at the time, Crimea became more isolated from the rest of the Golden Horde, as well as the geographical location of Crimea compared to the rest of the Golden Horde.\nDuring the height of her power, Canike supported Hac\u0131 I Giray in his fight for power in Crimea against the descendants of Tokhtamysh, K\u00fcch\u00fck Muhammad, and Sayid Ahmad I who were all competing for power in Crimea. Canike remained a key figure throughout the process of Hac\u0131 I Giray's rise to power.\nShe died in Crimea in 1437, which weakened Hac\u0131 I Giray and causing him to emigrate to Lithuania.\nLegacy\nThere are many legends and folktales surrounding the life and death of Canike. According to one legend, she died while defending the fortress of Kryk-Or from an enemy attack. A mausoleum was built for her in Chufut-Kale.\nReferences\n^ a b Gertsen & Mogarichyov 1993, p.\u00a060.\n^ Frolick 2011, p.\u00a0163.\n^ a b Gertsen & Mogarichyov 1993, p.\u00a061.\n^ a b Bakalay 2021, p.\u00a0113.\n^ Reichl 2018, p.\u00a0122.\n^ Osipov, Yuri, ed.

    "Waterloo Co-operative Residence Inc. (WCRI) is a non-profit student housing cooperative located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It is owned by its residents, also known as members, who attend the University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University, and Conestoga College. The co-op is governed by the Rochdale Principles.\nWCRI is significant in the history of the North American co-operative movement as it would expand to become, for a duration, the largest student housing cooperative on the continent. Today, the co-op can accommodate over 1300 residents in its dormitories and apartments, currently making it the second-largest organization of its kind in North America.\nWCRI was a founding member of the Ontario Student Co-operative Association and the North American Students of Cooperation.\nHistory\nWCRI was founded in July 1964 as the Waterloo division of Toronto's Campus Co-operative Residence Inc (CCRI).  Initially, two separate houses on University Avenue in Waterloo accommodated twenty-seven male and nine female students, though meals were taken together at the men's house. One cook was hired, but all other work was done by the members.  WCRI also added a house at 59 Albert Street.\nInitially, the adjacent University of Waterloo was not in favour of the co-operative. Wilfrid Laurier University held a similar view, refusing to host posters advertising its existence. However, the success of the Waterloo model would help to inspire a wave of Canadian student co-ops, funded under the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation\u2019s student housing program (then named the \"Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation).\nIndependence from CCRI was soon deemed desirable and the process of splitting off into a separate co-op was undertaken. Letters patent for the incorporation of WCRI were issued on November 8, 1965.\nBy September 1966, more than 200 students lived in various WCRI accommodations. In addition to owning several houses, the co-op had built a four-storey dormitory called Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Residence, the first such building in North America to be built, owned, and operated by students. At this point, full-time staff were beginning to be hired to handle various administrative matters.  The three floors of \"Hammar\" were named after the Freedom Summer murder victims, Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner.\nDespite some debt, plans were drawn up to build four more three-storey buildings on 2.5 acres of land that WCRI acquired at 280 Phillip Street. A $2.5 million mortgage was secured, and construction began early in 1968.\nIn 1993, WCRI owned 12 buildings and had assets of more than $15 million.  At that time it was one of three Ontario student housing co-ops that offered to lend money to The Triangle Housing Co-op, which was started in 1990 by students from Concordia and McGill universities, the Universite du Quebec a Montreal, and the Quebec Public Interest Research Group. The WCRI loan was contingent upon the Quebec students also securing a mortgage from a local caisse populaire, and a mortgate guaranteed from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.   \nIn 2003, the City of Waterloo reclassified the WCRI lands at 280 Phillip Street as Residential (from Industrial).\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, WCRI rented the 105-bed Dag Hammarskjold residence to the Region of Waterloo as short-term accommodations for people experiencing homelessness. The site was funded by the region and allowed people to keep physically distant from others while also offering food, harm reduction supplies and support to find permanent housing.\nReferences\n^ a b \"History of Co-ops\".\n^ https://wcri.coop/\n^ \"Co-op Details\".

    "Television related events in the USA during 1936\nThis is a\u00a0list of\u00a0American television-related events in 1936.\nEvents\nMay 13 - The NBC History Files at the Library of Congress support the notion that NBC was gradually groping for a way to differentiate the Red Network from the Blue Network. For example, they contain a confidential memorandum, dated May 13, 1936, which sets forth a network policy against mixing the Red and Blue network stations.\nJune 15- On June 15, 1936, Don Lee Broadcasting began a one-month-long demonstration of high definition (240+ line) television in Los Angeles on W6XAO (later KTSL, now KCBS-TV) with a 300-line image from motion picture film. By October, W6XAO was making daily television broadcasts of films.\nJuly 7 - On July 7, 1936, RCA and its subsidiary NBC demonstrated in New York City a 343-line electronic television broadcast with live and film segments to its licensees.\nNovember 6- RCA made its first public demonstration of its electronic television to the press on November 6. Irregularly scheduled broadcasts continued through 1937 and 1938.\nDecember 14 - The first coaxial cables were laid between New York City and Philadelphia by the AT&T Corporation. The cables would transmit both television and telephone signals.\nLate 1936- In late 1936, the NBC publication Great and Growing Greater explains NBC's ongoing efforts to expand both the size and the quality of the stations under its Blue Network subsidiary. \nBirths\nMain article: 1936 in television \u00a7\u00a0Births\nDeaths\nMain article: 1936 in television \u00a7\u00a0Deaths\nReferences\n^ \"NBC History Files\".

    "Preparatory body of the Council of the European Union\nA Council working party or working party is a preparatory body of the Council of the European Union. The more than 150\u00a0working parties are tasked with the first examination of legislative proposals by the European Commission and play a role during the trilogue meetings at the end of the legislative procedure of the European Union.\nWorking parties are made up of civil servants of the Member States, the European Commission and the General Secretariat of the Council and chaired by the Member State, which currently holds the rotating Council presidency.\nScholars argue that working parties informally make the majority of Council decisions.\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis for Council working parties is Article\u00a019(3) of the Council's Rules of Procedure. According to this rule, \"working parties may be set up by, or with the approval of, Coreper with a view to carrying out certain preparatory work or studies defined in advance\". Coreper, the Committee of Permanent Representatives, thus creates or approves every Council working party.\nFunction\nFirst examination of Commission proposals\nIn the legislative procedure of the European Union, the European Commission has \u2013\u00a0with some rare exceptions\u00a0\u2013 the sole right to propose new European legislation. If the European Commission proposes new legislation, this proposal (also called \"dossier\") is submitted to a Council working party for a first examination. The current Council presidency decides, which working party is to be tasked with the examination of the proposal.\nIn a Council working party, every Member State is represented by its civil servants, which come either from their ministries or their permanent representations. The members of the working party examine the commission's proposal and analyse whether the proposal is compatible with the legal system of the respective Member State and whether its policies are acceptable for their national government. For this work they receive instructions by their government. During the sessions of the working party, it is the task of the civil servants of the European Commission to explain and defend their proposal.\nThe examination of a Commission proposal ends, if the Council presidency \u2013\u00a0which rotates every six months between the Member States\u00a0\u2013 concludes that there is enough support for the adoption of a common position of the Council on the dossier, called the general approach. However, no voting takes place in a working party.\nThe Council presidency then submits the position of the working party on the dossier to Coreper for a vote. In Coreper, the Member States are represented by their permanent representatives, thus at ambassadorial level. If the vote is successful, the file goes to the Council of the European Union \u2013\u00a0which is convened at ministerial level\u00a0\u2013 for a further final vote on the general approach.\nDuring trilogue\nCouncil working parties also play a role during trilogues. Trilogues are inter-institutional negotiations in the European legislative process between the European Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission. During these negotiations a compromise between the positions of the three European institutions has to be found.\nThe Council presidency negotiates for the Council during the trilogue meetings. The presidency is often represented by an ambassador or the chair of the respective working party. The presidency has to report back to the Member States to update them on the progress of the negotiations. This is often done by informing the Council working party orally and sharing an updated \"four-column document\" with it, a document which has the Commission proposal in its first, the European Parliament's position in its second, the Council's general approach in its third and finally the current compromise position in its fourth column. During the working party sessions, the Members States can give feedback and guidance to the presidency on their opinions concerning the various compromise positions. This is of high importance because the compromise position adopted during trilogue needs, inter alia, to be formally approved by Coreper and the Council (at ministerial level), so enough support for it is essential.\nNumber of Council working parties and meeting schedule\nThe General Secretariat of the Council is tasked with providing a public list of the preparatory bodies of the Council and only the working parties on this list may meet as Council preparatory bodies. More than 150\u00a0working parties exist.\nThe meeting schedule varies to a large degree between the different working parties. Some meet every week, others only every six months.\nImportance in the Council's decision making process\nThe importance of the decision making of working parties has been rated highly. The scholar H\u00e4ge has argued that while \"working parties only 'prepare' the ministers' work,  de facto, they make the majority of Council decisions\". This position is justified with the observatio",

    "Professional wrestling stable in WWE\nThis article is about the stable. For other uses, see American Made.\nProfessional wrestling stable\nAmerican Made is a villainous professional wrestling stable consisting of leader Chad Gable, Brutus Creed, Julius Creed and Ivy Nile; with the latter three representing Diamond Mine. They are all signed to WWE, where they perform on the Raw brand. The stable is a spinoff to Gable's previous tag teams and factions, American Alpha and Alpha Academy.\nHistory\nOn the June 17, 2024 episode of Raw, after Gable was abandoned by his Alpha Academy teammates Otis, Akira Tozawa, and Maxxine Dupri following the weeks of Gable's abuse towards them, he was attacked by the debuting Wyatt Sicks stable at the end of the broadcast. Throughout the next few weeks, Gable attempted to reconcile with Alpha Academy, only to be rebuffed. At the same time, the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile showed sympathy towards Gable's situation with the Wyatt Sicks. On the July 15 episode of Raw, Gable called out Bo Dallas, the leader of the Wyatt Sicks, to the ring for a confrontation, although it was merely a ruse as the Creed Brothers attacked Dallas before being repelled by the other Wyatt Sicks members, turning both brothers heel for the first time since 2022 and cementing their alliance with Gable in the process. On the August 5 episode of Raw, the stable was officially named American Made, and they wrestled the Wyatt Sicks' Erick Rowan, Dexter Lumis and Joe Gacy in the main-event but failed to win the match. On the August 12 episode of Raw, The Creed Brothers faced Otis and Tozawa (who where accompanied by Dupri) in a Texas Tornado tag team match. During the closing moments of the match, Nile officially joined the group after she attacked Dupri, the attack distracted Otis and Tozawa, costing them the match. As a result, Nile turned heel for the first time since 2022 and reuniting with The Creed Brothers, thus making Diamond Mine a sub-group of the faction. \nMembers\nChad Gable\nIvy Nile\nCurrent\nSub-groups\nCurrent\nTimeline\nSee also\nWorld's Greatest Tag Team\nAmerican Alpha\nAlpha Academy\nDiamond Mine\nReferences\n^ Powell, Jason (June 17, 2024). \"WWE Raw results (6/17): Powell's live review of Jey Uso vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Finn Balor, and Iyo Sky vs. Zelina Vega vs. Kiana James in Money in the Bank qualifiers, Carlito vs. Dragon Lee\".

    "British Church of England priest and author\nFrank Colquhoun (28 October 1909 \u2013 3 April 1997) was a British Church of England priest and author.\nLife and career\nBorn in 1909 into a clergy family, Frank Colquhoun was educated at Warwick School and Durham University. A member of University College, he graduated LTh (1932), BA (1933), and later received an MA (1937). After his ordination in 1933, he served as curate at St Faith, Maidstone and then Christ Church, New Malden (1935\u20131939). He became vicar of St Michael and All Angels, Blackheath in 1939, a post he held until 1946. During the Second World War, his church was heavily affected by air raids. In 1944, he became one of the first faculty members of the newly-founded London Bible College, alongside Ernest Kevan and L.F.E. Wilkinson (later principal of Oak Hill College).\nAfter leaving Blackheath, Colquhoun was appointed as the Editorial Secretary for the National Church League, an evangelical Anglican association that was a forerunner of Church Society. As part of this role, he also served as editor of the journal Churchman, which published themed issues representing a range of evangelical Anglican scholarship. At the journal, he worked alongside an editorial board chaired by Max Warren, Canon of Westminster Abbey. During his tenure, the publication was given the subtitle \"A Quarterly Journal of Anglican Theology\", a decision taken, in Colquhoun's words, \"to secure the services of scholars who were of evangelical spirit but might not want to be labelled Evangelical.\" Colquhoun's period as editor ended in September 1953, when he was succeeded by John Pollock.\nIn 1952, he was inducted as Priest-in-Charge of Christ Church, Woburn Square, an office he held alongside acting as editorial secretary of the World Evangelical Alliance. He then became vicar of Holy Trinity Wallington in 1954. During his period at Wallington, he became involved in Billy Graham's first evangelistic crusades in London.\nIn 1959, while still serving in Wallington, he was made an Honorary Canon of Southwark Cathedral. Two years later, he left Wallington and became Canon Residentiary. During his incumbency, he was involved in the Southwark Ordination Course, a non-residential ministry training programme established by John Robinson. Colquhoun was initially deputy principal, but succeeded Stanley Evans as Principal after his death in a traffic accident in 1966. He held the role of Principal until 1972. During this time, he also served as the cathedral's chancellor.\nWhile at Southwark, Colquhoun caused controversy by criticising the Dean of St Paul's Cathedral during a morning sermon, after the Dean had parachuted from the dome of St Paul's to illustrate a sermon. Roger Royle recalled that, following this incident, \"for a while relations between St Paul's and Southwark were a little chilly to say the least.\"\nIn 1973, at the age of 64, he became Canon Residentiary at Norwich Cathedral. He also served as Vice-Dean and Treasurer, as well as a director of ordination training. In an obituary, Alan Webster described his preaching as \"fine and memorable\", showing a \"reverence for the scriptures and his shrewd and kindly commonsense.\" Colquhoun retired from church ministry in 1978, moving to Bexhill-on-Sea. He continued writing in his retirement.\nIn 1994, he was awarded the Cross of St Augustine by Archbishop George Carey, in recognition of his contributions to ordination training and liturgical writing.\nTheology\nColquhoun was an evangelical Christian, described in one obituary as representing a \"restrained Evangelical tradition\". He was known for his willingness to mediate between, and work with, representatives of different theological traditions in the Church of England. Reflecting on unity between Christians of different traditions, Colquhoun wrote in 1957, \"the Bible lays more emphasis upon fellowship than upon mere negative separation.\"\nWhen his colleague John Robinson published the controversial book, Honest to God in 1963, Colquhoun was challenged by other evangelicals about his relationship with Robinson. Colquhoun later stated, \"whatever differences there might have been between us, we had one thing in common: a profound love and reverence of the scriptures.\"\nPersonal life\nColquhoun married Dora Slater in 1934; the couple had one son and one daughter. Dora died in 1971. Colquhoun married Judy Kenney in 1973.\nPublished works\nColquhoun wrote a variety of Christian books, beginning in 1955 with Harringay Story, an account of Billy Graham's first London crusades. His most significant works were his collections of prayers, beginning with Parish Prayers (1967). While in parish ministry, he had recognised a need for a comprehensive collection of prayers that could be used in services, and compiled Parish Prayers in response to this need while he was Canon at Southwark. Parish Prayers included 1,798 prayers, indexed according to occasion. Some were gathered from other sources, some were written by C",

He won the Paris-Strasburg ultra long-distance race three times, in 1973, 1974 and 1976, after which he retired from competitive sport. Rinchard died in Namur on 20 July 2024, at the age of 93.\nRace walking career\nIn the 1950s Rinchard became a journalist covering local news, and especially sports in his home region of Namur. By the 1960s he had become a champion race walker. Rinchard was the Belgian champion of the 20 km race walk in 1963, 1968 and 1969. He was the Belgian champion of the 50 km race walk in 1966, 1969 and 1971. In 1972 he became the Belgian champion in the 100 kilometer race walk.\nAt the 1969 European Athletics Championships in Athens, he finished 19th in the 20\u00a0km walk and 13th in the Men's 50 kilometres walk.\nLater, he focused on ultra-long distances. He won the Paris-Colmar three times, in 1973 (493\u00a0km), 1974 (523\u00a0km) and 1976 (533\u00a0km). In 1976, he set a record hourly average of  7.709\u00a0km.\nIn 1974 he set a personal best for the 200\u00a0km race walk at 21 hours, 56 minutes and 39 seconds during the Les 28 heures de Roubaix. It is the 28th fastest time for this distance. He would win the Les 28 heures de Roubaix in both 1974 and 1975, covering 255\u00a0km and 239\u00a0km respectively.\nIn 1974 he received the Sports Merit of the province of Namur.\nIn 1975, he won the first edition of the 24-hour walking race in Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, a qualifier for the Strasbourg-Paris race walk. He walked 205\u00a0km over 24 hours, 6 minutes and 38 seconds.\nAfter winning his third Paris-Colmar in 1976, Rinchard quit competition, later becoming a civil servant at the Belgian Ministry of Finance.\nReferences\n^ \"Inmemoriam\".

    "\nThe Cry of Yara (Spanish: El Grito de Yara) was a declaration, battle cry, and uprising in eastern Cuba, initiating the Ten Years' War.\nHistory\nThe signaling of the Yara uprising occurred near Manzanillo in the eastern province of Oriente, at the sugar plantation and mill of La Demajagua. On October 10, 1868, the revolutionary proclamation of Cuba's independence known as the Cry of Yara (Spanish: El Grito de Yara) was issued by Cuban revolutionary and plantation owner Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes.\nFollowing the tolling of the slave bell that morning, which signaled his slaves that work was about to begin, they assembled before him, ready for instructions. C\u00e9spedes gave a passionate address, declared the independence of Cuba, and pledged to gradually end slavery. He first liberated his own slaves and invited them to fight alongside him against Spanish colonial forces, initiating the Ten Years' War in Cuba.\nThe Battle\nThe Cuban insurrectionists remained at Demajagua, leaving the next day at dawn on October 11, 1868, with intentions to attack and occupy the nearby town of Yara. A total of 147 men armed themselves with 45 fowling pieces, 4 rifles, and several pistols and machetes.\nThe Spanish garrison at Yara, situated between the cities of Manzanillo and Bayamo, fell to C\u00e9spedes in his first successful military encounter.\nAftermath\nThe news of the uprising at Yara inspired many to join the cause, leading to the eventual formation of the Cuban Liberation Army.\nCuba Independence Day is observed every year on October 10th as a national holiday and the anniversary of the beginning of the first Cuban War of Independence.\nReferences\n^ Dunn,\u00a0J.\u00a0M.\u00a0(2015).\u00a0Jose Marti: Cuba's Greatest Hero.\u00a0United States:\u00a0Pineapple Press.\n^ Making History: Interviews with Four Generals of Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces.\u00a0(2000).\u00a0United Kingdom:\u00a0Pathfinder.\n^ \"Cubans rose up against Spain in first war for independence\". dailytelegraph.com.au.

It is serialized in the monthly boys' love manga magazine Gateau from January 30, 2019, to December 28, 2019. A live-action television drama adaptation premiered on TV Asahi on August 3, 2024.\nPlot\nWhile returning home from a drinking party late at night, university student Isumi Sakuraba is mistaken for a minor due to his short, youthful appearance by police officer Ky\u014dsuke Amasawa and is almost taken into custody. When Amasawa shows up at Isumi's part-time job at the convenience store, Isumi answers his recommendations on food. Since then, Amasawa often shows up asking for more recommendations. Despite Isumi getting annoyed at Amasawa talking to him, he becomes concerned about his diet. One day, out of the blue, Isumi suggests going to Amasawa's home to cook for him. As the two grow closer to each other, Isumi finds himself falling in love with Amasawa, but Amasawa remains oblivious to his feelings. Eventually, Amasawa realizes he reciprocates Isumi's feelings, and the two become a couple.\nCharacters\nIsumi Sakuraba (\u685c\u5ead \u552f\u7d14, Sakuraba Isumi)\nPortrayed by: K\u014dki Tanaka\u00a0\nIsumi is a college student, but he is often mistaken for a minor due to his short stature and his appearance.

Yoriko stated that Y\u014dhei and Sh\u014dji were important in the story so that they could show a different side to Isumi compared to when he is with Amasawa.\nRihito Sh\u014dji (\u6771\u6d77\u6797 \u7483\u4ec1, Sh\u014dji Rihito)\nPortrayed by: Raiku\u00a0\nSh\u014dji is one of Isumi's friends at university who is also in the same cooking club.\nMedia\nManga\nSugar Dog Life is written and illustrated by Yoriko.

The studios have been the site of numerous notable recordings by artists including Merle Haggard, Don Williams, Kenny Rogers, Keith Whitley, R.E.M., Trisha Yearwood, Alan Jackson, Taylor Swift, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, Willie Nelson, Kacey Musgraves, Cole Swindell, Yo-Yo Ma, T Bone Burnett, Alabama Shakes, and others.\nHistory\nJack Clement Recording Studios (1969\u20131979)\nProducer and songwriter \"Cowboy\" Jack Clement built the studio in 1969 at 3102 Belmont Boulevard in Nashville with the help of engineer Charlie Tallent, who had been working at Owen Bradley's Bradley's Barn studio. The 16-track studio (later referred to as Studio A) touted a 35x45 foot live room with 22 foot ceiling. Shortly after building the studio, Clement acquired a house on an adjacent lot and repurposed it into an additional studio (Studio B). One of the first projects recorded at the studio was the Todd Rundgren-produced self-titled album by the Ian & Sylvia group Great Speckled Bird. In February 1970, the studio gained notoriety when Ray Stevens recorded the hit Grammy Award-winning song \"Everything Is Beautiful\" there. Other artists recording at the studio in its early years included Donna Fargo, Merle Haggard, and Don Williams.\nIn 1974, Clement sold the studios to producer Larry Butler and Al Mifflin.\nSound Emporium (1979\u2013present)\nIn 1979, Butler took over ownership and changed the name of the studios to Sound Emporium in May 1980. That year, more than 11% of the Hot Country Singles and 18% of the Hot Country LPs were recorded at the studio. The same year, Roy Clark bought into the studio to become a co-owner.\nButler utilized the studio to produce eight of Kenny Rogers' studio albums between 1977 and 1980, as well as Rogers' duets with Dottie West and West's successful solo albums of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nR.E.M. recorded their 1987 album, Document at the studio. Garth Fundis often worked at Sound Emporium in the 1980s, producing artists including Don Williams, Keith Whitley, and New Grass Revival.\nBy 1992, studio was fully owned by Clark, who sold it to Fundis that year. Fundis joined the two buildings and added a lobby and offices.\nIn the 1990s, Trisha Yearwood recorded her first six studio albums at Sound Emporium, and in 1996, Yo-Yo Ma, Edgar Meyer, and Mark O'Connor recorded Appalachia Waltz at the studio.\nBeginning in the late 1990s, T Bone Burnett produced three Grammy award-winning soundtrack albums at Sound Emporium: O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack) (1999), Cold Mountain (soundtrack) (2003), and Walk the Line (soundtrack) (2005). Other artists recording at the studio in the 1990s included Alan Jackson.\nArtists recording at the studio in the 2000s included Sugarland, Kenny Chesney, Sam Bush, and Elvis Costello, and portions of Taylor Swift's first four studio albums were recorded at Sound Emporium. In 2005, Juanita Copeland was appointed manager of the studios.In 2007, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss recorded portions of their award-winning collaborative album Raising Sand at Sound Emporium, and returned to the studio for its 2020 follow-up Raise the Roof.\nIn 2011, Fundis sold the studios to businessman and philanthropist George Shinn, and in 2013, the studio requested and was granted a historical marker for Jack Clement Recording Studios from the Historical Commission of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County.\nArtists recording at Sound Emporium in the 2010s included Willie Nelson, Jamey Johnson, Don Henley, Cage the Elephant, Josh Ritter, Zac Brown Band, Cyndi Lauper, Chris Isaak, Jason Isbell, Cole Swindell, Nefesh Mountain, Jimmy Buffett, St. Paul and The Broken Bones, Pop Evil, Little Big Town, Kaleo, Lake Street Dive, Kesha, and Cage the Elephant. Alabama Shakes' multiple Grammy award-winning album Sound & Color (2015) was recorded in Sound Emporium's Studio A.\nIn 2017, George Shinn gifted the studio to Lipscomb University, which committed to preserving the history of the studio and allowing it to remain business as usual. The university also established The George Shinn College of Entertainment & the Arts.\nReferences\n^ Williams, Bill (June 10, 1972). \"Clement Studios: A Success Story\". Billboard. p.\u00a0JC3.

    "Swiss para-athlete (born 1991)\nCeline van Till (born 20 June 1991) is a Swiss para-athlete. She competed in the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro as a para-dressage rider. In 2023, she became time trial world champion in the T2 category at the Para-cycling Road World Championships in Glasgow. Van Till is also an author, speaker and sits on the Grand Council of Geneva for the The Liberals.\nEarly life and injury\nWhen she was 6 years old, van Till started horse riding. At 15, she finished 5th in the Swiss Junior Championships and was accepted into the junior national dressage team. In 2008, she suffered a serious riding accident during training in Germany. Her horse reared up, fell, and buried van Till under it. She was in a coma for a month with a severe traumatic brain injury. She had to learn everything again: speaking, eating, walking. In the months she spent in hospital, she fell into a deep depression. She tried to take her own life twice.\nVan Till got back on her feet and gradually found her way in her new life. Impairments remained: her left field of vision is restricted, her vision is double and two-dimensional, her coordination and balance are impaired. Her mother had encouraged her to ride again.\nSporting career\nIn 2010, van Till competed in international competitions again. At the World Championships in Kentucky, she came 4th (freestyle) and 6th (individual) in para-dressage. In 2014, she competed in the World Championships again, and a year later she also competed in the European Championships. In 2016, she fulfilled a big dream: she took part in the Paralympics in Rio. A year later, she competed again in the European Championships, but soon she turned to a new sport.\nIn 2018, van Till started para-athletics. As a sprinter, she qualified for the 2020 Summer Paralympics. But in 2021, she fell on her head at a meeting in Tunis. For months, she was again plagued by severe headaches and dizziness. She decided to put an end to her sporting career.\nHowever, van Till couldn't get away from it. She took part in some fun runs and the Geneva triathlon. For this, she looked for a bicycle. Van Till got on a Paralympic racing bike with three wheels. In 2022, she announced her return to the sport and won gold in the individual time trial and road race at the European Championships.\nAt the 2023 Para-cycling Road World Championships in Glasgow, she became world champion in the time trial and won a silver medal in the road race. A week later, she was crowned European champion in both disciplines at the European Championships in Rotterdam.\nPersonal life and politics\nVan Till has written two books about her way back to life. \"Pas \u00e0 Pas. Historie d'un accident et d'une r\u00e9surrection\" and \"Tout est possible. D'une situation de l'autre\" was published in 2011 and 2021 respectively. In 2017, the film \"Buc\u00e9phale\" was released, which also tells her story. It won several awards. She is an ambassador for people with disabilities. In 2017, she founded the \"Tout est possible\" foundation, which supports disabled athletes.\nIn 2021, van Till also began her political career. She was a board member of the Geneva branch of The Liberals for two years before being elected to the Grand Council in April 2023.\nVan Till has a bachelor's degree in marketing and also works as a speaker.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e \"Celine van Till - Swiss Paralympic - Biografie - Resultate\".

    "Road in Kenya\nThe A12 road is a road in Kenya spanning a distance of 228 kilometers. It traverses the western region of the country, forming a crucial east\u2013west route. The A12 originates at the Ugandan border in Busia and extends westward, passing through the city of Kisumu before terminating at Mau Summit. This transportation artery connects key urban centers and facilitates movement across the region, playing a role in Kenya's infrastructure network.\nRoute\nThe A12 trunk road commences at the border crossing with Uganda in Busia, marking the beginning of its eastward trajectory. As it traverses the hills and densely populated areas northeast of Lake Victoria, the A12 maintains a continuous paved surface. The road passes through the city of Kisumu, where it shares a dual designation with the A1 and features a semi-grade-separated bypass. At Ahero, the A1 diverges, and the A12 enters the elevated highlands, ascending to notable altitudes: 2,000 meters in Kericho and over 2,500 meters at Mau Summit. The A12 ultimately terminates at a grade-separated junction with the A8, marking the end of its winding and scenic route through western Kenya.\nHistory\nThe town of Busia was once the primary border crossing between Kenya and Uganda, with construction on the Mackinnon-Sclater Road commencing as early as 1890. This road, designed for oxcart travel, connected Mombasa to the Busia border crossing. However, its significance waned with the construction of the Uganda Railway, leading to a shift in the main border crossing to Malaba, located slightly north. During the British colonial era, a network of roads was established, with the route via Kisumu being a notable one, although the more northerly route via Eldoret received greater attention. In recent years, significant upgrades have been made, particularly in Kisumu. A grade-separated bypass was constructed between 2013 and 2014, improving traffic flow. Additionally, a trumpet interchange connecting to the A8 was completed at Mau Summit in 2017, further enhancing the road network's efficiency.\nRoad number history\nThe road was initially designated as the A109, a prominent route within the East African numbering system that spanned three countries. However, it was later reclassified as the B1, indicating a lower hierarchical status. This reclassification occurred during a period when the A104 motorway to the north was considered the primary connection. In 2016, the road underwent another renumbering, this time being elevated to the A12 designation. This change reflects a reevaluation of the road's importance within the regional transportation network.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Kenya Roads Board\".

    "Mountain in Montana, United States\nMiller Mountain is a 10,494-foot (3,199-metre) summit in Park County, Montana, United States.\nDescription\nMiller Mountain is located 2.85 miles (4.59\u00a0km) northwest of Cooke City, Montana, in the Beartooth Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. It is set within the New World Mining District and the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's north slope drains into headwaters of the Stillwater River, whereas the south slope drains into Sheep Creek \u2192 Soda Butte Creek \u2192 Lamar River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 2,000 feet (610 meters) above Sheep Creek in one mile (1.6\u00a0km). The mountain is composed of gabbro, Miocene breccia, and Eocene monzonite porphyry. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names, and has been featured in publications since at least 1911. The mountain is named after Adam \"Horn\" Miller (1839\u20131913), who was one of the four trappers who discovered and named the New World Mining District in 1869, with the others being Bart Henderson, J. H. Moore, and James Gourley. Adam Miller staked a claim that he called Shoo Fly Mine at the 9,300-foot-elevation level on the south slope of this mountain which would bear his name. From 1878 through the late 1880s, the Shoo Fly produced gold, copper, and lead-silver ore, but it closed in 1893 to never reopen. (Henderson Mountain is 1.61 miles (2.59\u00a0km) east-northeast of Miller Mountain).\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Miller Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0\u00a0\u00b0F with wind chill factors below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F.\nSee also\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Miller Mountain, Montana\".

Portuguese military involvement ended in 1995 and was replaced by Macanese officers recruited to the MSF.\nOn December 20, 1999, the various police force branches of Macau (Security Forces of Macau and Judiciary Police), under the jurisdiction of Security and Justice departments (except the customs police, who were reassigned to the Financial Service Department) were assigned to the MSF, under the supervision of the secretary of security (security department). At the time of the handover of Macau to the People's Republic of China, plans were in place to modernize the police force with the goal of better positioning the force to combat organized crime and to stop illegal immigration.\nOn October 15, 2019, the MSF's Discipline Supervision Committee was given the power to investigate complaints made towards anyone working under the MSF.\nIn the midst of the 2021 COVID-19 pandemic, Macao saw a 26.1% increase in overall crime, with the number of cyber-fraud cases increasing by almost 50%. As a result, it was announced that the MSF will continue to improve their \"smart policing\" and work more closely with security forces in nearby regions.\nStructure\nThe MSF has the following organizations under its command:\nPublic Security Forces Affairs Bureau (DSFSM)\nUnitary Police Service (SPU)\nPublic Security Police Force of Macau (PSP)\nJudiciary Police (PJ)\nCorrectional Services Bureau (DSC)\nFire Services Bureau (CB)\nMacau Customs Service\nAcademy of Public Security Forces\nSee also\nPeople's Liberation Army Macau Garrison\nReferences\n^ \"NEWS GOV-MO: \u62db\u8003\u7b2c29\u5c46\u6fb3\u9580\u4fdd\u5b89\u90e8\u968a\u4fdd\u5b89\u5b78\u54e1\u57f9\u8a13\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4e4b\u5ef6\u671f\u958b\u8ab2\".

    "Military unit\n84th Infantry Regiment is a provisional military unit and formation of the Philippine Army organized during WW II to bolster the defense of Lanao Sector. It fought in Lanao during Japanese landing in Malabang and moved northward to Dansalan.\nOrganization\nThe idea to form a Bolo Battalion came from Brigadier General Guy O. Fort commander of 81st Infantry Division and Lanao Sector. His experienced with Moros over the years being a PC officer serving in Mindanao, having high regard and respect of their fighting abilities. He formed this unit to augment his division which only have 2 infantry regiments and service troops. Major Jay Navin was appointed to command the initial battalion and later anticipated expansion into a regiment.With lack of rifles soldiers resorted to Bolos, Kris, Darong, and Bows and Arrows. Thus, it was called Bolo Battalion. At one point the Regiment reached to 20,000 Moro volunteers but when the battle started many went back home or simply disappeared.\nJapanese landings\nKawaguchi detachment landed in Cotabato, Parang in Cotabato Province. Another contingent in Malabang in Lanao. Contingents from Parang and Malabang moved northward towards Dansalan to link up with Kawamura detachment who landed in Cagayan de Oro. 61st Infantry Regiment under Colonel Eugene Mitchell tasked to prevent the Japanese to move northward but his regiment was easily overwhelmed due to Japanese combined infantry, artillery, and air supports. Mitchell requested for reinforcement and General Fort sent 1/84th Infantry under Major Navin for his disposal. This did not prevent Japanese advanced and easily defeated and overwhelmed the defensive position Mitchell put up and eventually captured him.   \n81st Infantry Division troops including the Moro Battalion, although retreating are still fighting and successful in delaying to move north when ordered to surrender on May 11, 1942. Majority of Moro-Bolo Battalion dispersed without a trace but few surrendered including Major Jay Navin, who was executed during the death march from Dansalan to Iligan.\nThe Battalion was disbanded but those who refused to surrender resorted to guerilla warfare and ambuscade resulting high casualties of Japanese.\nReferences\n^ Morton, Louis (June 26, 1953).

    "RiverNahal Mahanaim (Hebrew: \u05e0\u05d7\u05dc \u05de\u05d7\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd) is a stream named after Kibbutz Mahanaim, located in the eastern Upper Galilee of Israel.\nGeography\nThe stream begins at an elevation of approximately 900 meters above sea level near the community settlement of Amuka, on the eastern slopes of Mount Yavnit. From there, it flows in a steep descent towards the southeast to Hatzor HaGlilit, crossing the settlement from west to east. At this point, the stream turns northeast, reaching the Korazim Plateau, passing north of Kibbutz Ma\u1e25anayim, Moshav Mishmar HaYarden, and Kibbutz Gadot, and empties into the Jordan River in an artificial channel diverted for drainage and agricultural purposes.\nThe stream forms the northern boundary of the Korazim Plateau. It is 13 kilometers long, and its drainage basin covers an area of 21 square kilometers.\nHydrology\nSeveral small springs emerge along the stream, enabling a continuous flow of water in parts of the stream, making these sections perennial. Near the ruins of Yardah, the \"Ein Yardah\" spring emerges, with a flow of up to 5 cubic meters per hour. These waters were previously utilized for agriculture and are now released into the stream.\nSprings\nIn the section of the stream between Amuka and Hatzor HaGlilit, the springs Ein Honi, named after Honi HaMe'agel, and Ein Marganit, a seasonal spring, flow. This section of the stream is well known for the blooming of the large Sternbergia.

    "1969 aviation accident\nAeroflot Flight F-28 was a domestic flight from Talas to Frunze (now Bishkek) that crashed on Saturday, June 28, 1969, in the mountains of the Kyrgyz Range near Talas, resulting in the deaths of 40 people.\nAircraft\nThe Il-14G with tail number 91495 (factory number 7343306, serial number 33-06) was produced by the Tashkent Aviation Production Association named after V. P. Chkalov on October 10, 1957, and initially had the tail number L1476 (L1474, re-registered in 1959). The aircraft was handed over to the Main Directorate of the Civil Air Fleet (GUGVF), which initially directed it on October 16 to the Kazakh Department of the Civil Air Fleet. In 1965, aircraft 91495 was briefly operated by the Tashkent aviation detachment of the Uzbek Civil Air Fleet, and on October 31 of the same year, it was transferred to the Frunze aviation detachment of the Kyrgyz Civil Air Fleet. By the time of the crash, the aircraft had 16,598 flight hours and 14,162 landings.\nCrash\nThe aircraft operated local flight Zh-28 on the Talas\u2014Frunze route. It was piloted by a crew from the 250th flight detachment, consisting of commander (KVS) Andrey Ivanovich Fateev, co-pilot Anatoly Stepanovich Shevchenko, navigator Yuri Mikhailovich Kurlaev, flight engineer Grigory Tikhonovich Shalygin, and radio operator Ivan Ivanovich Pleskanev. At 19:36 local time, the Il-14 took off from Talas Airport on a magnetic course of 270\u00b0. There were 35 passengers on board: 28 adults and 7 children.\nAfter departing from the airport, the aircraft, according to the established departure scheme, was supposed to turn left. However, the crew violated the rules and turned right towards the mountain range, starting to gain altitude while flying along the left edge of the route. At 19:42, the crew communicated with the dispatcher at Talas Airport tower, and the dispatcher, knowing that the crew was violating the established flight scheme, did not require a return to the correct flight path. Meanwhile, the airliner continued to deviate left from the route without reaching a safe altitude.\nAt 19:50, 14 minutes after takeoff, flying in clouds at an altitude of 3,150 meters (1,884 meters above the airport level) and having deviated left from the route by 8,700 meters, the Il-14 crashed into a treeless gentle (22\u00b0) slope of a mountain 39 kilometers northeast (azimuth 70\u00b0) of Talas Airport. The aircraft skidded up the slope for about 50 meters, completely disintegrated, and partially burned. All 40 people on board (5 crew members, 28 adult passengers, and 7 children) died.\nCauses\nAccording to the commission investigating the incident, the cause of the crash was the crew commander's violation of visual flight rules. He deviated from the route, failed to maintain a safe altitude, and flew in clouds. During the investigation, it was found that in the Frunze aviation detachment, crews regularly violated flight rules.\nReferences\n^ \"\u0418\u043b\u044c\u044e\u0448\u0438\u043d \u0418\u043b-14\u0413 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u2116: CCCP-91495\".

    "Museum in Iloilo City, Philippines\nMuseum of Philippine Economic History (Hiligaynon: Museo sang Kasaysayan sang Ekonomiya sang Pilipinas; Filipino: Museo ng Kasaysayan ng Ekonomiya ng Pilipinas) is a museum in Iloilo City, Philippines. It is located on the historic street of Calle Real in Iloilo City Proper.\nIt hosted at the Elizalde Building (Spanish: Edificio de Elizalde y Cia), which used to be the office of the Commission on Audit (COA) before it was donated to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) in 2015.\nHistory\nConstructed in 1905, the building that now houses the museum was originally known as the Edificio de Ynchausti y Cia. This structure served as a branch of the Ynchausti y Compa\u00f1ia in Iloilo, a significant trading company founded in 1816 by Basque entrepreneurs Jose Joaquin de Ynchausti Y Gurchategui and Joaquin Elizalde. The company was involved in various industries, including abaca, tobacco, sugar, shipping, banking, and hemp.\nIn 1934, the building was renamed the Elizalde y Compa\u00f1ia Building after the Elizalde family acquired the Ynchaustis' shares. The building was used as the family's residence, with the ground floor hosting the city's first comprehensive grocery store. The Commission on Audit (COA) later purchased the building and used it as its regional office until the agency relocated to Pavia, Iloilo. During COA's tenure, the building was also commonly referred to as the Elizalde Building and also hosted various offices of the Iloilo City Government, including the city health department, local civil registrar, city planning, city budget, and city tourism, among others, were located in the building.\nIn 2016, the COA donated the building to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. The building underwent restoration starting in 2018 and was subsequently opened to the public as the Museum of Philippine Economic History on February 11, 2019.\nGalleries and collections\nThe Museum of Philippine Economic History consists of 13 galleries spread across two floors. These galleries collectively narrate the evolution of the Philippine economy, highlighting significant industries and historical developments.\nThe ground level features exhibits on the history of the building itself, Iloilo's role as an economic center, and an overview of the country's economic history. It also displays antiques, including century-old paper bills from the Japanese and American eras, encased in glass.\nOn the second level, the galleries explore ten major industries that have shaped the Philippine economy, such as rice production, boat making, pottery, body ornaments, textiles, blacksmithing, tobacco, sugar, abaca, and coconut. The exhibits also depict the diverse livelihoods of Filipinos across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, and showcase collections related to the history of trade and commerce in the Philippines. The galleries are carefully curated to provide a comprehensive understanding of these industries and their impact on the nation's economic development.\nSee also\nMuseum of Philippine Maritime History\nMuseum of Philippine Political History\nReferences\n^ Sornito, Ime (2022-01-22). \"Iloilo City \u2013 a museum of architecture\".

    "Political party in United States\nUnionists in the border states organized political parties to oppose secession from the United States during the American Civil War. They extended critical support to the wartime administration of Abraham Lincoln while remaining outside Lincoln's Republican Party. While some harbored antislavery sympathies, most Unionists viewed the abolitionist movement with hostility and initially resisted Lincoln's efforts on behalf of emancipation. Unionist governments were opposed by Copperheads who opposed Lincoln's wartime policies and in some cases the war itself, as well as Confederate regular and irregular military forces.\nAbraham Lincoln won the 1860 United States presidential election on a platform that called for the exclusion of slavery from the U.S. territories; his election and subsequent efforts to suppress rebellion precipitated the secession of eleven slave states that formed the Confederate States of America. Unionist opposition to secession in the slave states included conditional unionists who preferred a compromise consistent with southern interests but held out the possibility of secession as a last resort, as well as others whose commitment to Union was unequivocal. These latter unconditional unionists remained loyal to the national government following the commencement of hostilities in April 1861, while many conditional unionists went over to the Confederacy.\nUnionists won critical elections in Kentucky and Maryland preceding the July 4, 1861 emergency session of Congress, sending more than a dozen members to the House of Representatives. They established provisional governments in Missouri and the western counties of Virginia that constituted the loyal civilian authority in those states throughout the war; a similar strategy was attempted unsuccessfully in East Tennessee. By 1862, issues related to slavery and emancipation increasingly divided Unionists between opposing factions, culminating in a formal split between Conservative and Unconditional (or Radical) Unionists. Unwilling to sanction proposals for immediate emancipation and Black enlistment, some Conservatives supported the Democratic Party in the 1864 United States presidential election; the remainder followed the Radicals into the National Union Party coalition. Lincoln's reelection on the National Union ticket demonstrated the Radicals' superior strength and established a beachhead for the Republican Party in the Upper South.\nUnionists came from diverse backgrounds, although certain commonalities were apparent. Most were former Whigs who had declined to join the Republican Party prior to the war; a minority were Unionist Democrats whose Jacksonian nationalism inspired a fierce opposition to disunion. They drew strength from Appalachia as well as merchants and businessmen in commercial centers like Baltimore. Montgomery Blair was the highest-ranking Unionist in the national government for most of the war as postmaster general in Lincoln's cabinet; other prominent Unionists included Francis Preston Blair Jr., John J. Crittenden, Henry Winter Davis, and Andrew Johnson.\nName\nIn its broadest application, \"unionist\" referred to active opponents of secession in the slave states who remained loyal to the national government following the commencement of hostilities in April 1861. Some historians and contemporary sources use the term \"unconditional unionist\" to distinguish between this former group and \"conditional unionists\" who expressed initial reservations with secession but ultimately supported the Confederacy. Elected politicians who pledged unconditional loyalty to the United States during the war were called \"Unionists\" or \"Unconditional Unionists.\" These terms were sometimes used interchangeably; in other cases, they referred to distinct party organizations, as in Maryland, where the Unconditional Union Party defeated the Conservative Unionists in the 1863 elections.\nUnionist political parties active in the border states and areas of the Confederacy occupied by the Union Army were known by a variety of names, including the Union Party, the Union Democratic Party, and the Unconditional Union Party. As the war progressed, rival Radical and Conservative organizations divided Unionists in several states. In Missouri, the Conservative state organization called itself the Unconditional Union Party in 1864; its opposition formed the Radical Union Party. Dissimilarly, in Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, and West Virginia, the \"Unconditional Union Party\" was the name used by the Radical faction. Many of these state Union parties sent delegates to the 1864 National Union Convention, including both Missouri Unionist factions.\nReferences\n^ Astor, Aaron (2012).

    "American judge\nRenee A. Roche is a retired American judge who served for over 25 years in Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court, encompassing Orange and Osceola Counties. She was Florida's first specialized business court judge, setting an example for the development of other business courts outside of the Ninth Circuit. She served in four of the Ninth Circuit's judicial divisions, and was a leader as an administrative judge and associate administrative judge in the criminal and civil divisions.\nJudicial service\nIn 1997, Florida Governor Lawton Chiles appointed Roche as a judge to the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court, which encompasses Orange and Osceola Counties, to replace the late Judge Gary Formet. Roche later was elected as a circuit court judge in 1998, and reelected in 2004, 2010, and 2016. Florida's circuit courts are trial level courts with broad jurisdiction to hear criminal cases involving felonies, civil disputes valued at over $50,000, family/domestic law matters, juvenile justice matters, and probate, guardianship and mental health matters. During her service as a circuit court judge, Roche handled cases in the criminal, civil, juvenile, and family/domestic divisions, and was an associate administrative judge and administrative judge in the civil and criminal divisions. On occasion, she had been appointed temporarily as the circuit's chief judge. Roche retired in January 2023.\nIn 2003, Ninth Circuit Chief Judge Belvin Perry issued an administrative order creating a trial level specialized business court division within the Ninth Circuit, effective January 2004.  The Ninth Circuit Business Court's specialized jurisdiction focuses on complex business, corporate and commercial cases, where one judge handles the case from beginning to end. Business courts had been considered in other circuits, but this was Florida's first business court program. \nPerry appointed Roche as the initial Business Court judge, making her the first specialized business court judge in Florida. Within one month, Roche had already taken on 200 cases, and within two years she had taken on 1,200 cases, 70% of which had closed. As the Business Court judge, she pursued an active and disciplined approach to case management. She required opposing lawyers in the case to meet early and prepare an extensive case planning report together, though she would set the actual schedule of deadlines which the parties had to meet. At her judicial case management conferences, she required parties as well as lawyers to attend. She used a refined motion practice to make that process more thorough and efficient. She also encouraged parties to consider alternative dispute resolution, such as arbitration or mediation. Lawyers with Business Court cases described Roche as having a \"no nonsense\" approach that required their being prepared, and that she herself was always thoroughly prepared and rendered thoughtful and timely decisions. The Business Court also was cutting edge in using electronic filing of documents, and having a high-tech courtroom.\nThe Ninth Circuit Business Court's success led judges and lawyers in other Florida circuits to consider similar business court programs in their own jurisdictions. The Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court in Miami-Dade County and the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit Court in Hillsborough County (Tampa) created business court programs of their own in 2006 and 2007 respectively. Prior to creating these business courts, those two circuits \"sent teams to scout out Roche's high-tech courtroom.\"\nIn 2006, the Florida Supreme Court made Roche a member of its Task Force on Management of Cases Involving Complex Litigation. Nationally, Roche served as a Business Court Representative to the American Bar Association's Business Law Section. Roche served on the Executive Committee of the team that organized the first meeting of the American College of Business Court Judges in 2005, co-sponsored by The Brookings Institute and the American Enterprise Institute.\nRoche was first appointed as a judge in 1995 to serve on the Orange County Court, a court of limited jurisdiction, where she handled traffic cases.\nLegal practice\nBefore becoming a judge, Roche was in the private practice of law for 11 years at the Florida law firm of Dean, Mead, Egerton, Bloodworth, Capouano & Bozarth. While still an attorney, she authored Beyond the Corporate Veil \u2013 The Potential Liability of Officers and Agents.\nEducation\nRoche received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Auburn University in 1980, and her Juris Doctor degree from the University of Florida College of Law (now known as the University of Florida Fredric G. Levin College of Law) in 1984.\nPositions and honors\n\u2022 Administrative judge, criminal division, Ninth Judicial Circuit Court, Florida.\n\u2022 Associate administrative judge, civil division, Ninth Judicial Circuit Court, Florida.\n\u2022 The Florida Bar Business Law Section and the Orange County Bar Association\u2019s Business Law Committee presented Roche with a",

These are barely convex, and are separated by a suture that is initially linear, then impressed and slightly crenulated under a lens. The whorls are increasing fairly quickly but regularly. The body whorl is obtusely angular, slightly convex at the base, only slightly depressed at the umbilicus, and very briefly deflected at the front. The aperture is oblique, semi-ovate, slightly lunate, with a simple, white peristome. The lips  are distant, with the outer lip narrow and depressed. The basal margin is almost horizontal, forming an almost right angle with the very short vertical columellar margin. The columellar callus is thin, translucent, expanded, defined below by a groove, and joined with the insertion of the outer lip. \nDistribution\nThis species occurs in Haiti.\nReferences\n^ a b c Alcadia haitensis (Maltzan, 1888).\u00a02 August 2024.\u00a0Retrieved through: World Register of Marine Species.\n^ Maltzan, H.F. von (1888). \"Diagnosen neuer Landschnecken von Haiti, gesammelt von Hermann Rolle 1887-88\".

    "\nDominican independence fighter (1819\u20131890)\nPedro Gregorio Mart\u00ednez (1819 \u2013 November 17, 1890) was a Dominican soldier of the Dominican Restoration War.\nEarly life\nHe was born in Sos\u00faa in 1819. He was born to Gregorio Mart\u00ednez and Catalina Abreu. He was said to have been one of the richest and most influential landowners in the entire North Coast.\nMilitary career\nWhen annexation was imposed, he admitted the facts and even agreed to be government representative in Sos\u00faa, where Mart\u00ednez had his home. But when the clarity of war and the feeling of national dignity reached his conscience, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, from Sos\u00faa, as called him to differentiate him from his namesake, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, that of Mu\u00f1oz, went to the front of battle.\nHe gathered his men and in intelligence with Juan Noues\u00ed organized the assault on Puerto Plata on August 27, 1863. The Spanish held the plaza and counterattacked, the patriotic forces retreated to remote rural areas. Mart\u00ednez, like his comrade-in-arms Gregorio de Lora, went to Santiago with his troops to reinforce the site against the occupiers. He moved to the camp in J\u00e1cuba, a point located between the two cities and on September 12, his men, together with those of commanders Juan Bonilla, Francisco Reyes Mari\u00f3n, Ras\u00edn Isur\u00fan and Norberto Reinoso, stopped the advance and made the columns retreat composed of generals Palanca and Primo de Rivera, made up of two thousand five hundred men, who were trying to force the passage towards Santiago.\nOn February 9, 1864, Pedro Gregorio Mart\u00ednez was promoted from colonel to general. In July he appointed him Governor of Santiago; On August 25, he was appointed Deputy to the Minister of War and on September 27, Commander of Weapons of San Jos\u00e9 de las Matas. He also held the governorship of Santiago under the government of General Gaspar Polanco. Before Polanco's fall he was already in disagreement with him, he had been absent from Santiago and a mediation effort was necessary for Mart\u00ednez to report back to his position and reconciliation was achieved. However, he joined Pedro Antonio Pimentel's pronouncement in January 1865 and, together with Benito Monci\u00f3n and Pimentel himself, formed part of the War Commission. Persecution broke out against many of Gaspar Polanco's supporters and Mart\u00ednez was extremely active in that task in Puerto Plata. Among those arrested on his order was a young ensign Ulises Heureaux, whom they nicknamed Lil\u00eds.\nFinal years and death\nShortly after the withdrawal of the Spaniards, Pedro Antonio Pimentel fell and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral ascended to the presidency. Then the persecuted one was Mart\u00ednez. They arrested him, transferred him to the Capital and was confined there, under the surveillance of the high police. After the Six Years administration, from 1868 to 1874, he retired almost completely from public life. His life ran until it was exhausted between agriculture and the pleasure of women. He died on his farm Sos\u00faa on November 17, 1890, and left among his most permanent inheritances, the largest descendants and the surname most abundant on the entire coast North and Northeast.\nSee also\nPedro Antonio Pimentel\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral\nUlises Heureaux\nJuan Antonio Alvarez\nReferences\n^ Mej\u00eda, Rafael Chaljub (2007).

    "United States historic place\nThe Glacier Ranger Station is a park ranger office for the Glacier District of Baker National Forest in the U.S. state of Washington. Camp Glacier (F-12) was one of 70 Civilian Conservation Corps camps in Washington state, among the earliest states to establish them, and built the Glacier Ranger Station. It was established in June 1933. This is the second building to serve as the Glacier Ranger Station. The first site was taken from public land on March 16, 1908. The structure was demolished (1908\u20131931) when the Mount Baker Highway was built on its current right-of-way. Two other wood-frame buildings from the old complex were moved and altered and in use.\nThe ranger station was completed in 1938. There was a complement of 200 enrollees and 45 local experienced men (LEMS) at the camp working under 5 army officers. Several buildings built for the camp, at some distance from the station, are still in use as a summer church camp (Mt Baker Bibleway Camp) on the Mt. Baker highway.\nThe work on the station took several months. Under the supervision of a journeyman mason the columnar basalt was quarried during the summer from deposits near Heather Meadows at the head of the Mt. Baker highway. It was trucked to the construction site where most of the laying was done by the mason. The framing, roofing, and finishing was done by men from the crew.\nThe plans for the station were modified from standard building plans done during 1936 for the Forest Service and initiated L.A.F. The changes are an example of the way designs and material were improvised to limit expenses and utilize the available labor.\nThe interior was remodeled in 1967, the exterior has not been altered. The Glacier Ranger Station, is a 'crafted example of CCC projects.\nAppearance\nThe Glacier Ranger Station is a detached structure. The single building floorplan has a central rectangular \"block\u201d with wings extending from the long sides. It is referred to as a four-room station on standard Forest Service plans, The single-story Alpine Bungalow style building is primarily of basalt masonry\nconstruction with wood frame wings on the east and west sides. The exterior masonry resembles shale but is thick enough to be near ashlar in appearance. The stone has a natural rustic texture. The sections of the wall not of masonry are sided with weatherboard. There is an exposed masonry chimney on the west side of the central block, just forward of the wing. It is offset by a six-foot extension opposite it on the east side. Together the chimney, extension, and square masonry columns flanking the main front entrance and at the end of the wings give the building a very solid cozy appearance.\nThe north facing main entrance is flanked by windows and is covered by the main gable end which extends 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) to support columns in portico fashion. The gable end itself is decorated with scroll work and cut out tree designs. The roof shape is basically a central high gable met on each side by gabled wings which drop to sheds on the east and west ends. The roof covering is cedar shingle. The basalt masonry is repeated in the curbing and fencing used on the grounds of the station.\nBibliography\nJeffcott, P.R. Ghechaco and Sourdough.1963. Pioneer Printing Go.

    "In this Chinese name, the family name is  Tong.\nTong Guogang (died 3 September 1690) was a Qing dynasty official. He was a maternal uncle of Kangxi Emperor.\nTong Guogang was the first (or the second) son of Tulai. According to the Comprehensive history of Eight Banners (\u6b3d\u5b9a\u516b\u65d7\u901a\u5fd7), The Tong (\u4f5f) family from Fushun was a sinicized Jurchen clan, they were incorporated into the Han Chinese Plain Blue Banner. However, Pamela Kyle Crossley stated that they were actually Han Chinese and falsely claimed to be related to the Manchu Tunggiya (\u4f5f\u4f73) clan of Jilin, using this false claim to get themselves transferred to a Manchu banner in the reign of the Kangxi Emperor.\nIn 1662, Tong Guogang succeeded to the hereditary rank Third class jinkini hafan and appointed the deputy commander of the imperial bodyguard (\u5167\u5927\u81e3). In 1675 he assisted Oja (\u9102\u624e) in the suppression of the rebellion of the Chahar Mongols led by B\u00fcrni (\u5e03\u723e\u5c3c) and was designated North Pacifying General (\u5b89\u5317\u5c07\u8ecd). In 1677, Tong Tulai was granted the hereditary rank First class Duke (\u4e00\u7b49\u516c) posthumously, Tong Guogang inherited this rank in the same time.\nTong Guogang was one of the members of the mission to Russia in 1688 led by Songgotu, which was dedicated to resolving border disputes between China and Russia. In the next year a border treaty was signed in Nerchinsk, the signatories were Songgotu on behalf of the Chinese emperor and Fyodor Alexeyevich Golovin on behalf of the Russian tsars. Songgotu's signature was followed by those of Tong Guogang, Langtan (\u90ce\u5766), Bandar\u0161a (\u73ed\u9054\u723e\u6c99), Sabsu (\u85a9\u5e03\u7d20), Mala (\u746a\u5587) and Unda (\u6e29\u9054).\nTong Guogang was killed in action by Dzungars in the Battle of Ulan Butung. He was given the posthumous name Zhongyong (\u5fe0\u52c7) by Kangxi Emperor. After Yongzheng ascended the throne, Tong was awarded posthumous appointment of Grand Tutor (\u592a\u5085).\nTong Guogang and Tong Guowei were said to believe in Christianity, though their political lives prohibited their formal conversions. They maintained close relationships with two Jesuit missionaries, Lodovico Buglio and Gabriel de Magalh\u00e3es.\nFamily\nFather: Tulai\nMother: Lady Gioro\nSiblings:\nEldest sister: Empress Xiaokangzhang (mother of Kangxi Emperor)\nEldest brother: Tong Guoji (\u4f5f\u570b\u7d00)?\nYounger brother: Tong Guowei (\u4f5f\u570b\u7dad)\nSons:\nEldest son: Olondai, served as the commander of the imperial bodyguard (\u9818\u4f8d\u885b\u5167\u5927\u81e3)\nSecond son: Fahai, served as minister of War from 1726 to 1727\nThird son: K\u016bwadai, served as minister of Works from 1727 to 1729\nReferences\n^ a b c \"\u6e05\u5185\u5927\u81e3\u4f5f\u56fd\u7eb2\u6392\u884c\u957f\u5b50\u5417\uff1f\". www.axjlzp.com.\n^ a b c d e f Hummel, Arthur W.

    "Turkish fairy tale\nThe Padisah's Youngest Daughter and Her Donkey-Skull Husband is a Turkish fairy tale published by researcher Barbara K. Walker.\nThe tale belongs to the international cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom or The Search for the Lost Husband, wherein a human princess marries a supernatural husband, loses him, and goes on a quest to find him. It is also distantly related to the Graeco-Roman myth of Cupid and Psyche, in that the heroine is forced to perform difficult tasks for a witch or her mother-in-law.\nSources\nResearcher Barbara K. Walker published in 1993 a tale archived at the Uysal\u2013Walker Archive of Turkish Oral Narrative with the title The Padisah's Youngest Daughter and Her Donkey-Skull Husband, first collected in 1970 from teller Niy\u00e2zi \u00c7am, from Bursa Province.\nSummary\nThe padishah assembles everyone in the palace courtyard for his three daughters to toss their apples to choose their husbands. The third daughter tosses hers and it lands near a donkey skull. She marries the donkey skull and, inside the nuptial chambers, her husband reveals he is a handsome youth, but asks her never to spill the secret, lest he disappears and she has to quest for him. Life goes on for both, and the princess visits the public bath for women. There, she is mocked for marrying a donkey skull.\nOne day, fed up with the mockery, reveals to the other women the true nature of her husband, who knocked on the door to the bath house to reprimand his wife. He tells her she may never find him again, even if she walks with an iron cane and wearing a pair of iron shoes, and vanishes. She decides to seek him out, and wears a pair of iron shoes. She reaches the Pearl Mountain, the Gold Fountain and the Diamond Fountain, where her husband lives in a mansion. They reunite, but he warns her that his mother is a giant that may devour her, so he changes her into a broom to hide her from his mother. The next day, he asks his mother not to hurt a padishah's daughter if she comes by; his mother agrees and he changes the broom back into his human wife.\nThe giantess forces the human princess to sweep or not sweep her house, to fill 40 cauldrons with her tears, and to climb the mountain, enter another mansion and get her a closed box. The husband advises the princess to drink from a fountain of bitter liquid and compliment it, to eat a sour pear from a tree and compliment it, close an open door and shut an open one, change the food of two animals for the correct ones (meat for a lion, grass for a horse), get the box and escape. She does all that and climbs down the mountain, but curiosity gets the better of her and she opens the box; \"wild music\" starts to leak from the box, until her husband appears to close it again. The princess delivers he box to the giantess mother.\nThat night, the couple decide to escape from the mansion, while his family follows them. First, they transform into a minaret and a mosque, then a sheep and a flock of sheep, and lastly a poplar tree (the princess) and a snake atop the tree (the prince). His mother comes to the tree; the snake asks her for a kiss and spits venom into her mouth. The princess and her husband return to her kingdom.\nAnalysis\nTale type\nIn the Typen t\u00fcrkischer Volksm\u00e4rchen (\"Turkish Folktale Catalogue\"), by Wolfram Eberhard and Pertev Naili Boratav, both scholars listed the variants with the horse husband under one type: TTV 98, \"Der Pferdemann\" (\"The Horse Man\"), which corresponded in the international classification to tale type AaTh 425. In a later book, Boratav stated that the Catalogue registered 25 variants, but six more had been collected since its publication.\nIn his monograph about Cupid and Psyche, Jan-\u00d6jvind Swahn\u00a0 acknowledged that Turkish type 98 was subtype 425A of his analysis, that is, \"Cupid and Psyche\", being the \"oldest\" and containing the episode of the witch's tasks. In the international index, however, Swahn's typing is indexed as type ATU 425B, \"The Son of the Witch\".\nMotifs\nThe supernatural husband\nIn most of the variants collected, the supernatural husband is a horse, followed by a man with a donkey's head and a camel. In other tales, he may be a snake, a frog or even Turkish hero Kaloghlan.\nThe heroine's tasks\nAnother motif that appears in the tale type is that the heroine must travel to another witch's house and fetch from there a box or casket she must not open. German folklorist Hans-J\u00f6rg Uther remarked that these motives (\"the quest for the casket\" and the visit to the second witch) are \"the essential feature\" of the subtype.\nThe heroes' Magic Flight\nAccording to Christine Goldberg, some variants of the type show as a closing episode \"The Magic Flight\" sequence, a combination that appears \"sporadically in Europe\", but \"traditionally in Turkey\". As their final transformation to deceive the ogress mother, the princess becomes a tree and her supernatural husband becomes a snake coiled around it. Although this episode is more characteristic of tale type ATU 313, ",

Also wrestled as  The Checkmate in Texas for World Class Championship Wrestling. \nCareer\nCharles started his professional wrestling career in 1959 in England for Joint Promotions. During the early 1960s, Charles worked both in England and France. \nIn February 1968, Charles made his debut in Japan for International Wrestling Enterprise. In 1970, Charles worked in Mexico and Germany in 1971. \nIn 1972, Charles left the United Kingdom and went to North America for NWA Mid-America. A year later in 1973, Charles worked in Florida where he spent a few years there. Also that same year he returned to Japan working for New Japan Pro Wrestling. \nIn 1977, Charles went to Tennessee to work for Continental Wrestling Federation where he became a household name. In 1979, Charles made his debut for Continental Wrestling Association also based in Tennessee. He became a three-time Southeast United States Junior Heavyweight Championship in Tennessee form 1979 to 1982. \nIn 1981, Charles wrestled for Mid-South Wrestling. \nIn 1982, Charles went to Texas for World Class Championship Wrestling wearing a mask as The Checkmate. The reason he used the gimmick was because wrestling is like a game of human chess.  He won the WCWA Television Championship on October 4, 1982 defeating Bill Irwin. He dropped the title to Frank \nDusek. Checkmate left World Class in 1983. \nDuring the later part of his career, Charles went back to Florida and retired in 1984.\nCharles passed away on February 13, 2015 after years of Alzheimer at 79.\nChampionships and accomplishments\nContinental Championship Wrestling\nSoutheast United States Junior Heavyweight Championship (3 times)\nGeorgia Championship Wrestling\nNWA Georgia Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Les Thornton\nNational Wrestling Alliance\nNWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship (3 times) \u2013 with Len Rossi (2)\nSoutheastern Championship Wrestling\nNWA Southeastern Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Ronnie Garvin (1)\nNWA Big Time Wrestling\nNWA Texas Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Tony Charles\nWCWA Television Championship (1 time)\nReferences\n^ \"Profile\".

    "Italian biochemist and biologist (born 1976)\nGian Gaetano Tartaglia (born 23 October 1976, Rome), is an Italian biochemist and computational biologists. He is currently a full professor in biochemistry at the Sapienza University of Rome and a Principal Investigator at the Italian Institute of Technology.\nBiography\nIn 2010 Gian Tartaglia became PI at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona. He was awarded the prestigious ERC grant in 2013 for his studies on the role of coding and non-coding transcripts in the regulation of amyloid genes ERC 309545 In 2014 Tartaglia was tenured in Catalonia as a professor of Life and Medical Sciences . In December 2018, Tartaglia became a full professor of biochemistry in the Department of Biology at University La Sapienza through a procedure of \"chiara fama\".  In 2019 he started to work at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) as a PI. In 2020, Tartaglia was awarded an ERC grant  for the study on the composition of phase-separated assemblies ERC synergy results.\nResearch\nThe Tartaglia lab observed that the structural content in RNA molecules is correlated to the number of protein interactions. This reveals the existence of a regulation level that directly links RNA to proteins especially for genes that are highly active in cellular processes (Sanchez de Groot et al.)\nThe lab develop the CROSS method to compute the secondary structure profile of large transcripts1. Positive scores indicate double-stranded regions, while negative values are predicted to be single-stranded. Predictions for murine XIST are shown (repetitive regions are marked with coloured boxes). The area under the ROC curve of 0.75 (inset) indicates high agreement with experimental data (correlations with individual domains are reported; (Vandelli et al.)).\nRecent discoveries\nTartaglia's group discovered that RNA plays a central role in protein aggregation, which offers the opportunity to develop methods to combat diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.  They found that FMR1 mRNA and Xist non-coding RNA are able to trigger the formation of large phase-separated assemblies, while other transcripts such as HSP70 mRNA and aptamers can prevent the aggregation of specific proteins acting as `solubilizers'. These observations strongly indicate that RNA-based molecules may be ideal candidates for the stabilisation of proteins in their native conformation by emulating the natural binding partners.\nMore specifically, the Tartaglia lab found that messenger RNA is a potent solubilizer blocking the formation of toxic aggregates that are potentially toxic to our organisms.\nThese results stem from previous computational analyses revealing that interactions of aggregation-prone proteins with messenger RNA have a solubilizing effect. The works lead to important discoveries on the regulation of a gene involved in Parkinson's disease alpha-synuclein. \nEarly contributions\nIn 2019, the Tartaglia lab released the first multi-organism transcriptome-wide database of protein-RNA interactions, which has been incorporated in Uniprot. Earlier n 2014, Gian's lab reported the first large-scale analysis of ribonucleoprotein networks (Genome Biology; ). The work, anticipated by a pilot project published in Nucleic Acids Research , sheds light on the relationship between functional and dysfunctional associations of protein and RNA molecules. In 2019 Gian's lab released the first multi-organism transcriptome-wide database of protein-RNA interactions, which has been incorporated in Uniprot.\nDiscovering the interactions of long non-coding RNAs\nIn 2011, Tartaglia's group introduced a method to perform large-scale predictions of protein-RNA associations (the first paper published by the laboratory was Nature Methods). The algorithm, 'fast predictions of RNA and protein interactions and domains at the Center for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona, Catalonia' (catRAPID ), evaluates the interaction propensities of polypeptide and nucleotide chains using their physicochemical properties. The algorithm shows performances comparable to experimental tools, as reported in recent surveys.\nThe lab developed the catRAPID method (Bellucci et al., Agostini et al..; Cirillo et al., ) methods to identify protein partners of non-coding transcripts such as XIST (18000 nt). Top: Predicted binding regions of different proteins, including PTBP1, LBR, SPEN, HNRNPK, HNRNPU and DKC1 (ranked by interaction propensity); Bottom: eCLIP validation of the binding regions. Protein DKC1 is used as a negative control.\nSolubility as an engine of evolution\nIn the period 2007\u20132010, Gian Tartaglia investigated the relationship between expression and solubility of gene. He found a close link between mRNA expression levels and protein aggregation rates. The original observations were published in Trends in Biological Science and received. An experimental follow up was published in Journal of the American Chemical Society. Based on the experimental results, he deve",

    "Seat of the Dresden city administration\nNew town hall from Pirnaischer Platz, Dresden\nThe New Town Hall seen from Georgplatz\nThe New Town Hall in Dresden is the seat of Dresden's city administration. It is located south-east of the Altmarkt on Dr.-K\u00fclz-Ring.\nThe town hall tower is 100.3 meters high or 329 feet (with figure, including lightning rod), a viewing platform, which is currently not open to the public, is 68 meters above the ground. The town hall clock has a diameter of four meters. The Golden Town Hall Man on the tower is 5.05 meters high from the base to the crown.\nThere are 16 larger-than-life sandstone statues at the height of the viewing platform. The partially restored statues represent 16 virtues (counter-clockwise starting in the north): Love, Hope, Mercy, Piety, Faith, Loyalty, Courage, Perseverance, Strength, Sacrifice, Wisdom, Kindness, Justice, Truth, Vigilance and Prudence.\nLove and hope\nVigilance and Prudence\nJustice and truth\nWisdom and goodness\nStrength and sacrifice\nCourage and perseverance\nFaith and loyalty\nMercy and piety\nHistory\nAs early as 1870/1875, the Old Town Hall on Altmarkt no longer offered enough space for the city administration, so the then Lord Mayor Paul Alfred St\u00fcbel began discussing a new building shortly after taking office in 1880. However, it was not until 1888 that a corresponding council resolution was passed. It was not until 1901 that an architectural competition for a new town hall was announced. Under the title Im Wettbewerbe f\u00fcr das neue Rathaus in Dresden preisgekr\u00f6nte und angekaufte Entw\u00fcrfe nebst dem amtlichen Entwurfe des st\u00e4dtischen Hochbauamtes / Eigentum der Stadt Dresden / F\u00fcr die Gebr\u00fcder der st\u00e4dtischen Kollegien bestimmt, the R\u00f6mmler & Jonas collotype company produced a two-part portfolio. The architect Karl Roth (1875\u20131932) from Darmstadt received one of the four prizes for his entry (no first prize was awarded) and the new town hall was built from 1905 to 1910 on the basis of his design under the joint supervision of the architects Karl Roth and Edmund Br\u00e4ter (1855\u20131925), for which, among other things, the neo-classical Prussian House and the Palais Lo\u00df from 1765 were demolished. The foundation stone for the New Town Hall was laid on September 29, 1905, with the last King of Saxony, Friedrich August III, also striking three hammer blows. The shell of the building with its sandstone fa\u00e7ade and high pitched roofs was completed in 1908, although there were considerable financing problems: for example, the town hall tower could only be erected thanks to generous support from the G\u00fcntz Foundation. The following two years were spent working on the ornate interior, with the ballrooms being painted by Eugen Bracht. The official inauguration took place on October 1, 1910.\nThe building was severely damaged during the bombing raids in February 1945, so that the extensive reconstruction was carried out in a simplified form from 1948 under the direction of Emil Leibold. The reconstruction of the paintings in the ballrooms was abandoned. The complex on Dr.-K\u00fclz-Ring was completed in 1952, followed in 1962\u20131965 by the reconstruction of the ballroom wing by Herbert Terpitz, Manfred Arlt and Kollektiv (interior design: Theo Wagenf\u00fchr). The Hellerau workshops were responsible for the interior design of the new plenary hall. Between 2011 and 2016, this wing was extensively renovated and the staircase and the Golden Gate were largely restored to their original state.\nThe larger-than-life sculpture \"Tr\u00fcmmerfrau\" (Rubble Woman), created by Walter Reinhold in 1952, stands on the town hall square to the east of the town hall to commemorate the many women who removed the mountains of brick rubble in the destroyed city after 1945. The original iron casting was recast in bronze in 1967.\nSince July 2024, a salon in the New Town Hall has been named after the theater actress and women's rights activist Marie Stritt. The hall is used for weddings and entries in the city's Golden Book, among other things.\nThe Schnurbaum-Allee on Dr.-K\u00fclz-Ring to the south of the town hall has been a protected natural monument (ND 99) since 1999. Thanks to the high regenerative power of the string trees, the city gardeners have succeeded in visually restoring the crowns damaged in the bombing raids. The avenue was extended with new plantings after 1945.\nGallery\nFront view 1914\nTr\u00fcmmerfrauen memorial in front of the town hall\nStaircase design by Otto Gussmann (1910\u20131914)\nGolden Town Hall Man\nGolden gate with the two lions by Georg Wrba\nReferences\n^ https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/dienstleistungen/c 212.php\n^ Ein Wettbewerbsentwurf f\u00fcr das neue Rathaus in Dresden des Berliner Architekten Heinrich Schweitzer im Architekturmuseum der TU Berlin\n^ im Verzeichnis Drucke von R\u00f6mmler & Jonas der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek\n^ The G\u00fcntz Foundation was a foundation set up by Justus Friedrich G\u00fcntz (1801-1875) in 1865, whose funds were to be used for charitable purposes and to beautify the town.\n^ Ka",

He contributed to the report on the 1911 excavations.\nJ P Bushe-Fox \u00a0then directed a series of excavations for the research committee of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

In 1931 J P Bushe-Fox suffered a serious accident when was buried by a collapsing trench in Colchester which had a continuing effect on his health. This accident delayed the publication of volume 4 of the Richborough report until 1949. A fifth and final report on the Richborough excavations was edited by Barry Cunliffe and published in 1968.\nBushe-Fox served on the Council of the Society of Antiquaries in 1924-5, in 1930, and again in 1936-7 and was an active member of the Research Committee from 1912 until 1943.\nHonours and awards\nElected FSA June 1915\nHonorary MA degree from Manchester 1928\nAwarded a CBE in January 1945\nPersonal life\nJ P Bushe-Fox\u2019s father died when he was fourteen.

    "\nThe Siege of Malacca occurred in 1573, when the Sultan of Aceh attacked the Portuguese city of Malacca with the support of the Sultanate of Golconda and Kalinyamat. The Portuguese resisted the attack and the Muslim forces were routed.\nBy October 1573 Malacca was barely defended since most soldiers were embarked in commercial missions. The Sultan of Aceh gathered 7,000 men and a fleet of 25 galleys, 34 half-galleys, and 30 craft and requested assistance from the Queen of Kalinyamat to besiege it.\nOn October 13, the Acehnese force landed south of Malacca and dealt severe casualties to the Portuguese who attempted a sortie. After that, they began attacking the fortress with incendiary projectiles, causing several fires but a storm put them out and scattered the fleet, therefore the assault was called off. The Acehnese captain then decided to establish a naval base by the Muar River in order to force the city to surrender through a naval blockade, capturing any passing ships that could carry supplies to the city. An attempt to board a galleon and two carracks anchored by the Island of Naus was met with heavy resistance and suffered severe casualties from Portuguese gunfire.\nOn November 2, a carrack commanded by Trist\u00e3o Vaz da Veiga arrived with the newly appointed commander of Malacca, Francisco Rodrigues, along with other reinforcements. The commander immediately summoned a council to discuss the situation and the best course of action. The Acehnese fleet was causing shortages in the city, so it was decided that it was urgent to organize a force to repel it. Thus, one carrack, one galleon, and eight half-galleys set out on November 16 to the mouth of the River Formoso, where the enemy fleet had shifted to. With the river in sight, the Acehnese fleet set out whilst the wind was in their favour to meet the Portuguese. Despite being outnumbered the Lusitanian galleys positioned themselves ahead of the carrack and the galleon to board the Acehnese galleys in the front. The crews of the galleys fired volleys of shrapnel and matchlock fire and threw gunpowder grenades, while the carrack and the galleon fired their heavy caliber artillery, sinking many Acehnese galleys. Despite having Ottoman gunners and cannons, the Acehnese artillery was not effective. Once their flagship, a very large galley with over 200 fighting men, was boarded and its flag taken by the Portuguese, the remainder of the Acehnese fleet scattered, having lost four galleys and five half-galleys, with several more sunk or beached.\nSee also\nWar of the League of the Indies\nSiege of Malacca (1568)\nPortuguese Malacca\nAcehnese-Portuguese conflicts\nNotes\n^ Monteiro, Saturino (2011).

One of his denim jackets won a design competition that was sponsored by Levi Strauss & Co. in 1973, further increasing his popularity. It was later shown in an exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In the early 1980s, Billy assumed sole control of the shop and moved it to a larger location at Melrose Avenue. With more space, he included more varieties of items in the store, including books and jewelry. Billy opened Wacko in 1984 after some adjacent stores became vacant. He also established the La Luz de Jesus art gallery on Soap Plant's top floor in 1986. Billy returned to the original location in 1995, bringing over his other ventures there too.\nDescription\nThe Soap Plant sells a large variety of soaps, oils, and lotions. They are all hand-made. Wacko mainly sells pop culture toys and miscellaneous products but also has one of the largest collections of postcards in Los Angeles. Many celebrities, including Johnny Depp, Jack Nicholson, and Madonna, have visited the shop.\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Official website\". Archived from the original on August 5, 2024.

    "Powerful Midwestern Derecho in July 2024\nThe July 2024 Midwest derecho was a powerful derecho affecting the Midwestern United States on the evening of July 15, 2024, primarily eastern Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana. It caused high winds and spawned an outbreak of numerous tornadoes. Some areas reported torrential rain and gusty winds to the region.\nMeteorological synopsis\nNOAA risk on the day of the storm.In the lead up to the storm, the SPC had uncertainty about the storm. Thus, there were no day 4-8 outlook for the storm. As the day of the event arrived, the Storm Prediction Center noted the elevated probabilities for severe weather to materialize, as conditions over eastern Iowa and north-west Illinois were threatening. However, they still had uncertainty about the storm. So, they only issued a marginal (level 1/5) for their day two outlook. On the day of the storm, they had grew more and more certain that there would be a large and wide scale wind event, issuing a slight (level 2/5), then an enhanced (level 3/5), and finally, a moderate risk (level 4/5).\nAs the evening progressed, the line of storms developed. As such, hundreds of wind reports were received by the SPC over the course of the day, some discussing wind gusts of up to 105 miles per hour (169\u00a0km/h), as was the case in Camp Grove, Illinois. 5 people were confirmed dead from the storm. While the event was primarily dominated by the severe derecho that developed, multiple tornadoes were also reported, including a long-tracked EF2 tornado in Illinois. According to The National Weather Service, 32 tornadoes were reported, 5 people also died from the tornadoes, this is the most tornadoes in the Chicago area ever recorded\nImpact\nThe derecho affected portions of eastern Iowa and western and central Illinois. The storm caused a tree to fall on a home in Indiana, killing a 44-year-old woman. Another person was injured by a falling tree in Chicago. A wind gust of 105\u00a0mph was recorded near Camp Grove, Illinois. O'Hare International Airport was affected, with 70-80\u00a0mph winds at the airport. However, people were still allowed to board, leaving many stranded on the runway.\nReferences\n^ \"July 15, 2024: Derecho Produces Widespread Wind Damage and Numerous Tornadoes\". 3 August 2024.{{cite web}}:  CS1 maint: url-status (link)\n^ a b \"Derecho, Tornadoes, Flooding All In Week's Weather | Weather.com\".

    "Class of gunboats, Republic of China Navy\nThe Minquan class (Chinese: \u6c11\u6b0a; pinyin: M\u00ednqu\u00e1n) was a class of gunboats originally built for the Republic of China Navy. The class of ships consisted a pair of semi-sister ships and served in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War.\nBackground\nThe inauguration of Chiang Kai-shek as Chairman of the National Government of China on 10 October 1927 in Nanjing brought about a new era of centralization not seen in China since the Qing Dynasty. This also finally allowed the government to finally reinvest in China's derelict and poorly maintained navy, that had seen decades of infighting and mutinies throughout the previous Warlord Era. After a contract for new gunboats from Mitsubishi in Japan was turned down, on the grounds of the China Arms Embargo Agreement of 1919, the Kuomintang government turned to the domestic Jiangnan Shipyard. The Jiangnan Shipyard had recently successfully completed an order of six river gunboats for the United States Navy and an order, for a 418-ton gunboat based on the previously built American designs was placed with the Shanghai based shipyard. Over the next several years, a steady order of five new gunboats was placed with Jiangnan, as well as many additional navy orders for modifications and refurbishment. The third and fifth of this series of ships were two semi-sister ships called the Minquan (Chinese: \u6c11\u6b0a; pinyin: M\u00ednqu\u00e1n; Wade\u2013Giles: Ming Chuen; lit. 'People's Rights') and the Minsheng (Chinese: \u6c11\u751f; pinyin: M\u00ednsh\u0113ng; Wade\u2013Giles: Ming Sen; lit. 'People's Welfare'). These ships were named after two of the Three Principles of the People of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the father of the Republic.\nDesign\nThe two ships Minquan and  Minsheng were based on the 1920s American Yangtze Patrol gunboat designs by Superintending Engineer Robert Buchanan Mauchan of Jiangnan Shipyards. These ships were built by Jiangnan from 1913 to 1928. The new series of Chinese gunboats were designed by the succeeding Superintending engineer. Yi Zaifu (\u53f6\u5728\u99a5), who had helped work on the original US Navy designs and expanded on them. The two ships of the Minquan class were shallow draught gunboats with sea-going capabilities but expressly built for riverine service and designed to be capable of sailing up the Upper Yangtze River, all the way to Chongqing. The first ship of the class, Minquan was laid down 16 January 1929, in the same month as the completion of the gunboat Xianning and the launching of the gunboat Yongsui. Of intermediate size and displacement of the two other gunboats, Minquan had a full displacement of 600 long tons (610\u00a0t), an overall length of 59.9\u00a0m (196\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) and notably a draught of only 1.8\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in). The ship was powered by two vertical triple expansion engines, pushing two propellers at 2,600\u00a0bhp (1,900\u00a0kW) with two cylindrical boilers that were coal fired rather than oil fired like the American gunboats. Minquan was able to reach 17.5 knots (32.4\u00a0km/h; 20.1\u00a0mph) and carried 280 long tons (284\u00a0t) of coal. She was planned to be completed in only eleven months and construction went swiftly, with a launching by 21 September 1929 and completion on New Years Day, 1930. The second ship of the class was Minsheng which was laid down in January 1931, a year after Minquan was completed. Minsheng was built to a modified design of Minquan, with lessons learned from the construction of the light cruiser Yat Sen, which was built between the two ships in 1930, applied to the Minsheng and making her a semi-sister ship to Minquan rather than being an exact copy. These changes led to a small increase in displacement by 50 long tons (51\u00a0t) and increase in length by 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in). The draught was also increased slightly to 2.0\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) which would still allow the Upper Yangtze up to Chongqing but not further to Yibin. The engine layout remained the same, but with an engine output of 3,600\u00a0bhp (2,700\u00a0kW), increasing the overall top speed to 18.5 knots (34.3\u00a0km/h; 21.3\u00a0mph).\nArmament was also another area of variation between the two semi-sister ships. Generally both ships had the same main and secondary armament, but tertiary and anti-aircraft armament were mounted, dismounted or swapped out often on ROCN ships in the 30s. The main armament of both ships consisted of a single bow mounted 120\u00a0mm (5\u00a0in)/45 and a single 100\u00a0mm (4\u00a0in)/45 mounted on the stern. Minquan and Minsheng at various times were also armed with a single high-angle 76\u00a0mm (3\u00a0in)/40 mounted in front of the bridge, two or three 57\u00a0mm (2\u00a0in)/40, six 7.92\u00a0mm (0\u00a0in) machine guns and/or one 20\u00a0mm (1\u00a0in)/65 anti-aircraft gun.\nService history\nBoth ships avoided much of the ongoing turmoil of the early 1930s, with neither ship reportedly being assigned to any of the ROCN's four squadrons in 1933. By the time of the Marco Polo Bridge incident in 1937 Minsheng was located at Wuhan and Minquan at Chongqing. While Minquan guarded the temporary capital of the Republic after Battle of Nanking ",

    "Sculpture in Los Angeles, California, U.S.\nNot to be confused with Statue of Kobe Bryant.For the statue of the two at the crash site in Calabasas, see 2020 Calabasas helicopter crash.\nThe Kobe and Gianna Bryant Memorial Statue is a work of public art designed by American visual artist Karon Davis and created by the Fine Art Studio of Rotblatt-Amarany. The bronze sculpture of the American basketball player Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna Bryant was commissioned by Vanessa Bryant, the wife of Kobe and mother of Gianna. It stands on a base located near Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles. The statue was unveiled in 2024.\nHistory\nOn August 2, 2024, the Los Angeles Lakers unveiled a statue of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna Bryant, outside Crypto.com Arena. The statue, which was revealed during a private ceremony, depicts Kobe embracing Gianna while they sit on a bench, wrapped in angel wings. The statue contains a plaque with a quote from Kobe Bryant, stating,\nGianna is a beast. She's better than I was at her age. She's got it. Girls are amazing. I would have five more girls if I could. I'm a girl dad.\u2014\u200aKobe Bryant\nThe memorial is located near the Los Angeles Kings Monument.\nOn January 26, 2020, Bryant and his daughter Gianna were tragically killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. The crash claimed the lives of all nine people on board, including Kobe and Gianna. The statue serves as a poignant reminder of their legacy and the bond they shared.\nThe date of the unveiling, 8/2/24, holds numerological significance as it represents Kobe's two NBA numbers (8 and 24) and Gigi's number 2, which she wore on the basketball court. The statue captures a moment of affection between Kobe and Gigi, inspired by their interactions while sitting courtside at various NBA games in 2019.\nFuture Plans\nThe statue of Kobe and Gianna Bryant is the second of three planned memorials outside the Crypto.com Arena, being unveiled 5 months and 24 days after the Statue of Kobe Bryant. The third statue, which will depict Kobe in his No. 24 jersey, is expected to be unveiled during the upcoming NBA season. These statues serve as a lasting tribute to Kobe Bryant's illustrious career and his enduring impact on the sport of basketball.\nSee also\nVisual arts portal\n2024 in art\nMurals of Kobe Bryant\nReferences\n^ \"Lakers Honor Kobe and Gianna Bryant With Rotblatt Amrany Sculpture | Studio Rotblatt Amrany\". rotblattamrany.com.

    "Historical timeline\nLogo used since 2021.\nMTV, originally an initialism of Music Television, is an American cable television channel that launched on August 1, 1981 by Warner Communications. It is currently owned by Paramount Global, and is one of the company's flagship brands. \nMTV's original focus was on music-related programming, including blocks of music videos. As its viewership and popularity among teenagers grew, and with the eventual rise of internet-based services and platforms rendering its original format obsolete, MTV gradually scaled down its music-centric programming from the 1990s and through the 2000s. Reality shows and documentaries have since made the bulk of MTV's original programming, while the channel has also produced scripted comedies, adult animation, and teen dramas.\nHistory\nBackground\nSee also: Music video \u00a7\u00a0History and development, and Music television\nIn the 1970s, music television focused on live performances, with shows such as The Midnight Special, In Concert, and The Old Grey Whistle Test. Numerous major musical acts had made music videos to accompany their songs, including the Beatles, Bob Dylan, ABBA and Queen, but the concept and format had not been widely established.\nIn 1979, executives at the newly formed Warner-American Express Satellite Entertainment Company felt teenagers were an overlooked and potentially lucrative audience, and hoped to develop a television format to target them. MTV's original format was created by the executive Robert W. Pittman, later the president and CEO of MTV Networks. He tested the format by producing and hosting a 15-minute show, Album Tracks, on New York City's WNBC-TV in the late 1970s. Pittman's boss, Warner executive vice president John Lack, had shepherded PopClips, a TV series created by the former Monkees member Michael Nesmith, whose attention had turned to the music video format in the late 1970s.\nLaunch\nFurther information: List of first music videos aired on MTV\nOn Saturday, August 1, 1981, at 12:01\u00a0a.m. Eastern Time, MTV was launched with the words \"Ladies and gentlemen, rock and roll\", spoken by John Lack and played over footage of the first Space Shuttle launch countdown of Columbia (which took place earlier that year) and the launch of Apollo 11. The words were followed by the original MTV theme song, a rock tune composed by Jonathan Elias and John Petersen, playing over the U.S. flag changed to show MTV's logo changing into different textures and designs. MTV producers Alan Goodman and Fred Seibert used this public domain footage as a concept; Seibert said that they had originally planned to use Neil Armstrong's \"One small step\" quote, but lawyers said that Armstrong owned his name and likeness and that he had refused, so the quote was replaced with a beeping sound. A shortened version of the shuttle launch ID ran at the top of every hour in different forms, from MTV's first day until it was pulled in early 1986 in the wake of the Challenger disaster.\n1981\u20131992: The rise of the music video\nThe first music video on MTV, which at the time was only available to homes in New Jersey, was the Buggles' \"Video Killed the Radio Star\". It was followed by Pat Benatar's \"You Better Run\". Occasionally the screen went black when an employee at MTV inserted a tape into a VCR. MTV's lower third graphics near the beginnings and ends of videos eventually used the recognizable Kabel typeface for about 25 years; but they varied on MTV's first day, set in a different typeface, and including details such as the song's year and record label. MTV's on-air programming was originally produced from the Teletronics studio facility at West 33rd Street in Manhattan, New York; programming was uplinked to satellite from a facility in Hauppauge, New York that also served as the uplink for sister networks Nickelodeon and The Movie Channel (originally, then-owner Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment had planned to uplink MTV from a facility located at the studios of WIVB-TV in Buffalo, New York, where Nickelodeon and The Movie Channel had been uplinked; said facility was planned to be expanded to handle MTV's needs, but the deal with WIVB fell apart when Warner-Amex was unable to reach a deal with channel 4's ownership concerning a long-term lease). MTV later moved studio facilities to Unitel Video's complex located on 57th Street (ironically located across the street from the CBS Broadcast Center, owned by future corporate sibling CBS) in 1987, remaining until 1995 when MTV chose to begin producing studio content in-house.\n\"MTV has paved the way for a host of invaders from abroad: Def Leppard, Adam Ant, Madness, Eurythmics, the Fixx and Billy Idol, to name a few. In return, grateful Brits, even superstars like Pete Townshend and the Police, have mugged for MTV promo spots and made the phrase 'I want my MTV' a household commonplace.\"\n\u2014\"Anglomania: The Second British Invasion\", by Parke Puterbaugh for Rolling Stone, November 1983.\nAs programming chief, Robert ",
    "\nThe labyrinth museum The World of Eternal Silence is an underground museum of practical archeology located in the village of Fazil in the Shaki region. The museum provides protection and exhibits archaeological exhibits of the area where it is located.\nLocation\nThe World of Eternal Silence Museum-Labyrinth is located 30\u00a0km from the city of Shaki in the Republic of Azerbaijan, in the village of Fazil, on the territory of the Tepebashi monument. The museum occupies an area of about 0.07 hectares in the middle of the Tepebashi monument.\nCreation\nThe World of Eternal Silence Museum-Labyrinth was created in March 2005 with the personal funds of the outstanding archaeologist Nasib Mukhtarov, an employee of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan, who conducts archaeological research in Sheki. Nasib Mukhtarov supervised the field research carried out at the Tepebashi monument in 1984\u20132017. Some of the graves recorded as a result of the research have been preserved in the condition in which they were discovered and are exhibited inside the museum. The main feature of the museum is that the grave forms of the Tepebashi monument are preserved in place and are presented to visitors visually with all the details of the monument. The name of the museum as a labyrinth is due to the fact that its internal plan resembles a labyrinth.\nExhibits\nThe Labyrinth Museum of the World of Eternal Silence contains 16 exhibits. The exhibits consist of earthen graves preserved in the form in which they were found and a farm well. The exhibits are located on the walls and in the corridor.\u00a0 The exhibits presented mainly relate to samples of the material culture of the Iron Age and ancient times. There are also artifacts in the exhibit, the shape of which dates back to the Late Bronze Age \u2014 Early Iron Age. These exhibits are mainly represented by ceramics. Some ceramics contain features that are not typical of the local culture. These vessels allow us to trace the trade relations of that period (Hellenic-Caucasian Albania). The exhibits contain samples of weapons of the Caucasian Albania type - spearheads, daggerheads, pointed and flat swords, metal and non-metal jewelry - necklaces, bracelets, pectoral jewelry, earrings, etc., as well as ceramic vessels for various purposes. Among them, three female idols are considered the main finds that attract attention. Another interesting find stored in the museum is the osteological remains. Birds, large and small horned animals, horses, pigs, fish, etc., and the associated bones create an image of hunting, fishing, and animal husbandry. The most common osteological remains here belong to extinct mountain cattle. These exhibits displayed in the museum are sources that form certain ideas about the socio-economic life, and religious and mythological worldview of the Iron Age and ancient times.\nReferences\n^ a b c Muxtarov, N\u0259sib; B\u0259d\u0259lova, \u0130ntizar (2008). \u015e\u0259ki b\u00f6lg\u0259sind\u0259 apar\u0131lan arxeoloji k\u0259\u015ffiyyat i\u015fl\u0259rinin q\u0131sa hesabat\u0131 (Faz\u0131l k\u0259ndi, 10 iyun- 03 iyul 2008) (in Azerbaijani). \u015e\u0259ki. p.\u00a09.{{cite book}}:  CS1 maint: location missing publisher (link)\n^ Alm\u0259mm\u0259dov, X\u0259qani (2006).

    "Spanish bullfighter (1957\u20132024)\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  V\u00e1zquez and the second or maternal family name is  Silva.\nJos\u00e9 Luis V\u00e1zquez Silva (Spanish: ; 9 June 1957 \u2013 26 July 2024), better known as Pepe Luis V\u00e1zquez (Spanish: ), the same name that his father had used professionally, was a Spanish bullfighter, the youngest in a bullfighting \"dynasty\" in Seville that stretches back to the nineteenth century.\nEarly life\nV\u00e1zquez was born on 9 June 1957, the eldest of what would eventually be seven siblings from the marriage between Pepe Luis V\u00e1zquez Garc\u00e9s and Mercedes Silva Gim\u00e9nez. By the time when V\u00e1zquez was born into this bullfighting family, his father had retired from bullfighting but in 1959, when the younger Pepe was two years old, the elder Pepe went back to the bullring for one season. Since V\u00e1zquez Garc\u00e9s was one of Spain's most celebrated bullfighters, even eventually being named one of the twentieth century's ten most important, bullfighting was a pervasive influence in the V\u00e1zquez household. Nevertheless, the two-year-old's mother was determined to keep him, and all her other children, away from the profession of tauromachy; however, in the end, her efforts were futile. Although her eldest son began by finishing high school and then going to college and studying agronomy, he soon changed his mind about his future, and decided that he would follow in his father's footsteps. He wanted to be a bullfighter.\nV\u00e1zquez's novillada\nV\u00e1zquez achieved considerable fame as a novillero (novice bullfighter who fights yearling bulls), with commentator Antonio Lorca observing that V\u00e1zquez's fame as a novillero reached quite a bit higher than it ever would later in his career as a matador. For instance, on 13 March 1979, he made a great impression on the bullfight-goers at Valencia and was obliged to walk a lap of the bullfighting ground after each one of the bulls that he had slain, both of which had been supplied by the Marqu\u00e9s de Domecq ranch. This was late in his novillada, and he shared billing on this afternoon with Juan Antonio Ruiz (known as \"Espartaco\") and Francisco Ojeda. His form and his personality\u00a0\u2013 along with his prominent \"dynastic\" name\u00a0\u2013 drew attention on this occasion.\nHe had his d\u00e9but with picadores on 22 May 1979 in Alburquerque, alternating with Mary Fortes, a novillera who would leave the bullring four years later, without ever rising to matadora, to become a businesswoman, a bullfighting critic, a bull breeder and a teacher at a bullfighting school in M\u00e1laga. Thereafter, though, V\u00e1zquez still fought yearling bulls without picadores, with some successes that rather stood out, such as the one that he achieved on 20 August 1979 at Lloret de Mar, a town in Catalonia, when he was awarded both the ears from his second bull, with his two companions who shared billing that day, the Mexican matador Mariano Ramos, and the rejoneadora Emi Zambrano.\nV\u00e1zquez first trod the bullfighting ground at Madrid's Las Ventas, Spain's foremost bullring, on 9 September 1979, alternating with Fernando Vera and Aguilar Granada, and facing bulls supplied by the Torrestrella ranch. He fulfilled 35 contracts that year and 41 the next. His name was very fashionable on minor bullfighting bills, but the results at many of these events fell rather short of what he had hoped for, as witnessed by the mere fourteen ears that he cut in 1980; this was considered a small number against what other bullfighters achieved. As commentator Paco March diplomatically put it many years later, V\u00e1zquez's mark in bullfighting arose not so much from his statistics as from his bullfighting itself, which he did with fondness and charisma, among other qualities, \"to the rhythm of a heart that beat systoles and diastoles of art and purity.\" He did leave an impression during these seasons, though.\nV\u00e1zquez's alternativa\nV\u00e1zquez took his alternativa\u00a0\u2013 thus ending his novillada\u00a0\u2013 in a ceremony at the Maestranza bullring in Seville on 19 April 1981. Standing as his \"godfather\" was his own uncle, Manolo V\u00e1zquez Garc\u00e9s, while famous Spanish bullfighter Curro Romero stood as the witness, making this event a very strong draw for aficionados. Two ranches supplied the bulls for this important event in V\u00e1zquez's professional life, with some from Juan Pedro Domecq, and some from Jandilla, including the bull used in the ceremony, named Desesperado and weighing 482\u00a0kg. The bullfighting itself did not stand out, with nothing worthy of note happening. He did receive an ovation for the fight with the Jandilla bull, however, but silence for his second fight that day.\nV\u00e1zquez had confirmation of his alternativa on 23 May that same year at Las Ventas in Madrid. Standing once again as \"godfather\" was his uncle Manolo, but the witness this time was bullfighter Curro V\u00e1zquez (no kin). He fought four bulls supplied by the Socorro S\u00e1nchez-Dalp ranch at this event, although the fights were rather lacklustre, with nothing worthy of note happenin",
    "\nPlace in British Columbia, Canada\nNicola is an unincorporated community in the Nicola region of south central British Columbia. The place is on the north side of the Nicola River at the southwestern end of Nicola Lake. On BC Highway 5A, the locality is by road about 11 kilometres (7\u00a0mi) northeast of Merritt, 77 kilometres (48\u00a0mi) southeast of Spences Bridge, and 90 kilometres (56\u00a0mi) southwest of Kamloops.\nRoads and trails\nIn 1871, Canford\u2013Nicola\u2013Quilchena was a trail, preferably taken with a guide. During 1876\u201377, the Spences Bridge\u2013Nicola wagon road was built.\nAround 1881, construction of the Kamloops\u2013Nicola wagon road began. From 1893, the valley was connected with the outside by stage to Kamloops and Spences Bridge. Mail service was once a week.\nBy the 1920s, gravel highways existed to Spences Bridge and Kamloops.\nThe opening of the Coquihalla Highway in 1986 has increased traffic on Highway 5A.\nEarlier community\nIn 1867, Edwin Dalley, the first European settler, an architect from London, England, built his homestead at the foot of the lake. Within a couple of years, John Clapperton was the next to pre-empt. Clapperton was postmaster in 1874 or longer, but the post office predated that year.\nIn 1880, Albert Elgin Howse settled and was appointed Indian agent. In the early 1880s, he became a silent partner in the general store established by George Petit. Howse later opened stores in four other locations. In 1884, he bought out Petit. That year, he resigned as Indian agent following the killing of Harper's Billy, a First Nations member. In an assault that started within the general store, the beating continued outside. Although Howse was never charged, opinion was divided as to whether this constituted murder. In 1883, Howse completed building one of the finest residences in the Nicola Valley, which he lavishly furnished. That year, the Anglicans established a school. Howse was postmaster 1884\u20131892 and established a portable steam sawmill in 1887, which operated as the Dominion Steam Saw and Planing Mills.\nBoth built in 1890, Howse operated the Driard Hotel and the first roller flour mill in the valley, which traded as the Nicola Roller Flour Mills. In 1894, Howse, John Clapperton and Edwin Dalley combined their land to lay out the Nicola townsite. The survey comprised 765 building lots, which would take another decade before significant buyer interest emerged. The settlement was named after the river and lake.\nSince the 1890s, townspeople and ranchers had lobbied for a railway link. By 1905, when railway construction was imminent, people eagerly awaited a passenger and freight service, which would bring in supplies and take out cattle to markets. Few appreciated that the primary reason for the railway was to facilitate the development of the extensive coalfields well to the southwest, which would ultimately diminish Nicola. That year, the Bank of Montreal opened a branch in a portion of the A.E. Howse dry goods store, and the Nicola Herald began publishing. By that time, the town had a telephone service and athletic association.\nDuring the boom years of 1905\u20131907, additional stores opened to supplement the existing A.R. Carrington and A.E. Howse ones. However, Merritt soon became the new commercial centre. Apart from local farmers and ranchers, most Nicola residents and businesses left during 1907\u20131911. By 1910, the two-sheet Nicola Herald (published every Thursday) had become a broadsheet renamed The Merritt Herald and Nicola Valley Advocate (published on Fridays).\nStanley Kirby, who purchased the Driard House Hotel from A.E. Howse for $27,000 and renamed it the Nicola Hotel, was left bankrupt before World War I. The hotel closed in 1923. The war also depleted Nicola of adult males. One such volunteer reminisced of the Nicola Valley to Major C. S. Goldman, a British Army officer, who later became the largest single landowner in the valley. Soon, only a few old-time inhabitants remained in the township. Nicola became a place to periodically visit for a picnic or to watch a good horse race.\nA.E. Howse maintained his residence until November 1919, when Major Goldman bought all his land. Later called the UT House (after the Goldman stock brand), the building is one of the oldest houses in the Nicola Valley. During the inter-war years, Goldman remained a visitor. Following World War II, he became a resident and acquired more ranches. In 1951, he donated approximately 60 hectares (149 acres) of land around Nicola Lake for public use, which became Monck Park. In 1954, fire destroyed the Nicola Ranch store and post office, an adjoining butcher shop, and the company offices. On his death in 1958, Goldman owned all but three of the properties in the Nicola townsite.\nIn 1960, the post office closed. In 1959, George Parker Sr., a Texas millionaire, purchased the Nicola properties. Subsequently, the township site fell into a state of disrepair and fire destroyed several buildings. In the late 1970s, the Nicola Ranc",

    "2024 Album by Asake\nLungu Boy is the third studio album by Nigerian singer Asake. A follow-up to his previous album, Work of Art (2023), the album was released on 9 August 2024 through YBNL Nation and Empire Distribution. The album also contains guest appearances from Wizkid, Travis Scott, Stormzy, Central Cee and Ludmilla, alongside production from P.Priime, Magicsticks, Mike Dean, Sarz and Sak Pase.\nRelease and promotion\nOn 10 June 2024 Asake announced his Lungu Boy World Tour alongside the album. On 21 June 2024, Asake released the album's lead single, \"Wave\" with Central Cee, followed by its official music video on the same day. On 5 August, Asake shared the album's official tracklist, previewing guest appearances from Central Cee, Ludmilla, Stormzy, Travis Scott and Wizkid.\nCritical reception\nLungu Boy received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Luke Seaman and Poppie Platt of The Daily Telegraph's review awarded the album four out of five stars, characterizing it as a \"musical experiment\" and commending Asake for his innovative approach. Writing for The Guardian, Ben Beaumont-Thomas gave the album the same score, praising the album as an impressive wave of West African pop. However, he also noted that it was not as strong as Asake's second studio album, Work of Art.\nRolling Stone's Mankaprr Conteh rated the record three and a half stars, writing: \"Lungu Boy keeps the faith but explores new sounds, becoming Asake\u2019s most rhythmically and emotionally diverse album yet, with some experiments more successful than others.\"\nHowever, NME's Kyann-Sian Williams only awarded Lungu Boy three stars in a more mixed review. They praised Asake for \"still rewriting the rulebook on Afro-pop\", but questioned why it took some time to \"get to the good stuff\".\nTrack listing\nCharts\nRelease history\nReferences\n^ Mamo, Heran (10 June 2024). \"Asake Announces Lungu Boy World Tour: Here Are the Dates\".

The monument occupies an area of about 10 hectares on a hill.\nGeographical location\nYoncal\u0131 monument is located in the Eyrichay basin, on the territory consisting of the Yoncal\u0131 hill, on the southwestern side of the village of Fazil in the Shaki region. The Yoncal\u0131 monument is divided into two main parts: the upper and the central. The central part is Yoncal\u0131 I, and the upper part is Yoncal\u0131 II. Yoncal\u0131 I is sometimes called \"Q\u0259bir\u00fcst\u00fc\" as a state. The part above the grave is surrounded by \u018fyri\u00e7ay on one side and a swamp on the western and northwestern sides.\nArchaeological research\nThe Yonjali monument was registered by archaeologist Nasib Mukhtarov in the 1990s. In 2013\u20132015, archaeological research of the monument was carried out by an expedition organized by the Institute of Archaeology and Folklore of ANAS (headed by Nasib Mukhtarov). In 2013, research has shown that the central part of the monument\u2014the area called \"Top of the Cemetery\"\u2014contains the period from antiquity to the spread of Islam, and the northern part\u2014the period before antiquity.\nIn 2013, during the study of the grave monument, 3 Scythian-type arrowheads were identified. One of them was found resting on a femur. Monuments related to the antiquity of Caucasian Albania were also possibly discovered. Scythian arrowheads indicate that the burial here took place in the BC. This happened in the late 8th to 6th century. The studies conducted have shown the establishment of stratification in the Yoncal\u0131 area in the middle of the 1st millennium BC. Studies conducted in 2013 and 2014 thought that most of the burials found in the upper layers belong to the middle and upper classes, while the graves discovered in the lower layers in 2015 belonged to representatives of the lower classes.\nReferences\n^ a b Muxtarov, N; B\u0259d\u0259lova, \u0130; \u018fmrahq\u0131z\u0131, C (2013). \u015e\u0259ki Arxeologiya v\u0259 Folklor qrupunun, \u015e\u0259ki-Qax-O\u011fuz arxeoloji ekspedisiyas\u0131n\u0131n 2013-c\u00fc ild\u0259 g\u00f6rd\u00fcy\u00fc i\u015fl\u0259rin geni\u015f hesabat\u0131 (in Azerbaijani). \u015e\u0259ki-Bak\u0131. pp.\u00a022\u201323.{{cite book}}:  CS1 maint: location missing publisher (link)\n^ \"\u015e\u0259kid\u0259 arxeoloji t\u0259dqiqatlar apar\u0131lm\u0131\u015fd\u0131r\".

His father, Alberto, is a professor of Economic History at the University of Parma and director of the Department of Economics, while his mother is a judge.\nHe graduated from the Liceo Classico Galvani in Bologna and briefly moved to Udine to study acting at the Nico Pepe Academy of Dramatic Art.\nCareer\nMusic career\nMain article: Lo Stato Sociale\nUpon returning to Bologna, he decided to focus on music and began working as a DJ at the local radio station Radio Citt\u00e0 Fujiko.

    "Country house in Colwall, Herefordshire\nPerrycroft is a country house in the district of Colwall, Herefordshire, England. The house was built between 1893-1895 and was designed by C. F. A. Voysey for John William Wilson. Perrycroft is a Grade II* listed building.\nHistory\nJohn William Wilson, PC, JP (22 October 1858 \u2013 18 June 1932) was a British chemical manufacturer and politician who served for 27 years as a Liberal member of parliament (MP) for North Worcestershire. His father, John Edward Wilson, had founded the chemical manufacturers, Albright and Wilson, in 1856, in partnership with his fellow Quaker, Arthur Albright. The firm specialised in phosphorus production, principally for the making of matches and became extremely successful. John William Wilson followed his father onto the board of Albright and Wilson, and also held directorships with other major concerns, including Bryant & May and the Great Western Railway.\nWilson knew the area of the Malvern Hills through family connections, and it was proximate to the Oldbury site of the Albright and Wilson works. In 1893 he bought 80 acres of land around Colwall and commissioned Charles Vosey to design a country house. Pevsner records the price as \u00a34,900. Perrycroft was Vosey's first major commission and did much to establish his reputation.\nPerrycroft remains privately owned but the gardens and house are occasionally opened for visitors.\nArchitecture and description\nThe house is designed in Vosey's trademark Arts and Crafts style. The hipped roofs are of green/grey slate, with sweeping eaves, and five monumental chimney stacks. The bell bracket on the \"pagoda-like\" tower at the entrance front displays another typical Vosey feature; the bracket is a stylised human face or grotesque, a device he often deployed. Historic England considers it \"one of Vosey's best houses\". Vosey's 21st century biography, David Cole, in his study, The Art of CFA Voysey, describes it as \"the very essence of a 'Vosey house', not only in its catalogue of Vosey details and palette of materials, but also in its form and .... composition\". Perrycroft is a Grade II* listed building. Other listed structures on the estate include a summer house,\n a lodge, a coach house, and two sets of stables.\nGallery\nIllustration of Perrycroft from Modern Homes, 1909\nIllustration of Perrycroft from Modern Homes, 1909\nNotes\n^ Historic England, among others, describes John William Wilson as a \"railway magnate\", although his fortune derived from the family chemical works.\n^ Vosey became a favoured architect of the English upper-middle classes, designing houses for businessmen, politicians and artists. The First World War virtually destroyed his architectural practice, and his last decades saw him largely focused on furniture and fabric design.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Historic England. \"Perrycroft\u00a0(Grade II*) (1178660)\".

    "American writer and author\nJoanna Ferrone, also known as Jo Ferrone, is an American writer and author. She is best known for co-creating the fictional character Fido Dido with Sue Rose. Ferrone and Rose also created Angela Anaconda, which Ferrone describes as a reflection of her upbringing.\nBiography\nFerrone was the third of eight children, raised in the Catholic faith but Ferrone would later describe herself as agnostic. She was raised in Oyster Bay, New York. Growing up, she described herself as the \"consummate tomboy\".\nFerrone identifies as a lesbian, and her family's \"only gay child\". In an interview, Ferrone expressed her previous feelings that had she been born another time, she would have transitioned.:\u200a338\u200a\nCareer\nFerrone was heavily involved in the New York queer arts scene of the 1970s and 1980s.:\u200a337\u200a She cited queer pop art influences such as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring as central to her and Sue Rose's practice.:\u200a337\u200a At the time of Fido Dido's creation, Ferrone worked as the owner to a stock photo library. Before that, she worked as a department store gift wrapper, waitress, receptionist, and the owner of a stock photography company.\nFerrone was the co-creator of the mascot Fido Dido alongside Sue Rose, Ferrone's partner at the time. He was designed in 1985 with his appearance inspired by a mutual friend of the two,:\u200a337\u200a and the design was initially put on t-shirts, his design later caught the attention of Patricia Field. Three years following his creation, his design caught the interest of Pepsi's agency looking for a character to market 7-Up that embodied an energy that was \"cool, identifiable and really liberal in its outlook\". Ferrone was responsible for naming and creating the personality of the character, and served as his \"business manager\".\nFerrone co-created Angela Anaconda alongside Sue Rose, Ferrone described the series as a reaction to the premises she saw on TV while she was growing up and the questions she felt while comparing herself to the picture perfect families that were shown. Ferrone described Angela Anaconda as \"very autobiographical, that was the most natural thing.\" Ferrone revealed in an interview with YouTuber Alexandra Bender that she was not involved in Angela Anaconda's eventual inclusion in Digimon: The Movie.\nShe served as the founder and president of Honest Entertainment, which aimed to remaking Fido Dido for a modern audience. In 2002, Ferrone was slated as the co-creator and co-writer to the show Family Values alongside Tom Brady. The series was described in Variety as \"wholesome \u201950s-style family living in the modern world\" and \"\u201cPleasantville\u201d gone wild\". Family Values was to be produced by Honest Entertainment in collaboration with Mainframe Studios.\nFollowing the success of Angela Anaconda, Ferrone alongside Rose, were responsible for writing the Angela Anaconda companion books. Ferrone would later publish Julian Dickerson and the Higher Ups and Doreen by Doreen as an independent author.

    "\nThe Victorian FIDA (Football Integration Development Association) Football League (VFFL) is an Australian rules football based in Victoria. The competition provides people with an intellectual disability the chance play football at a competitive level.\nThe league is mix-gendered and open to people aged 14 and over, with four regional conferences, the largest being in metropolitan Melbourne.\nAs of 2022, FIDA has 28 clubs and approximately 800 players. The competition is supported by the Hawthorn Football Club, Box Hill Hawks, Coburg Football Club and Williamstown Football Club.\nHistory\nOrigins and formation\nOn 18 June 1989, a football clinic for people with an intellectual disability was run by the Hawthorn Football Club and the Hawthorn City Council. Hawthorn players Peter Curran and Rob Dickson were among those conducting the clinic.\nA skills and match day was held a year later on 21 October 1990 following a steering committee, where the \"Football Integration Development Association\" name was agreed on.\nThe first FIDA matches were held on 7 March 1991. Six clubs \u2013 Chadstone Chargers, Werribee Blues, Mitcham Tigers, Hawthorn, Royal Magpies and Heidelberg \u2013 participated in the first round, with Broadmeadows and Keilor Saints joining the competition later in the year.\nThe 1991 grand final was held at Glenferrie Oval, with Chadstone (who were undefeated for the season) defeating Mitcham 19.14 (128) to 2.5 (17). Former Hawthorn coach John Kennedy Sr, whose son Bernard played for Chadstone, presented the trophy and medallions.\nFour new clubs entered the competition in 1992, and it was expanded to a multi-division format with Division 1 and Division 2.\nVAFA links\nIn 1993, FIDA established relations with the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA), who agreed to house the FIDA co-ordinator at VAFA headquarters at Elsternwick Park. The VAFA agreed to promote FIDA, with the VAFA Umpires Association also supplying umpires to the competition.\nThe links with the VAFA were formally established in 1995, supporting FIDA to grow further. The same year, Bendigo also entered the competition as its first regional-based club.\nRecent growth\nFIDA employed a General Manager in 2009, which saw the competition develop rapidly. By the end of the 2015 season, FIDA had more than 600 players, and the running of the competition was taken over by AFL Victoria.\nNo season was held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2021 season was curtailed because of COVID-19 restrictions.\nClubs\nMetropolitan Conference\nMonash Demons was known as Mount Waverley Demons in 2020\nNorthern Conference\nCentral Conference\nWestern Conference\nSouth Warrnambool was known as the Hampden Hurricanes until 2017\nFormer clubs\nSource: \nReferences\n^ a b \"FIDA\".

    "\nChemical compound\nDiiodine hexaoxide, is a chemical compound of oxygen and iodine with the chemical formula I2O6. It belongs to the class of iodine oxides, and is a mixed oxide, consisting of iodine(V) and iodine(VII) oxidation states.\nSynthesis\nReaction of periodic acid with iodic acid in sulfuric acid:\nHIO3 + H5IO6  \u2192  I2O6 + 3H2O\nThe thermal decomposition of meta-periodic acid in vacuum also leads to the formation of diiodine hexoxide.\nChemical properties\nBelow 100\u00a0\u00b0C, diiodine hexaoxide can be stored stably in the absence of moisture. When dissolved in water, an exothermic reaction to form iodine and periodic acid takes place. When heated above 150\u00a0\u00b0C, decomposition into diiodine pentoxide can be observed:\n2 I2O6  \u2192  2 I2O5 + O2\nThe compound is diamagnetic, which is attributed to the different oxidation numbers of the iodine atoms. Structurally, the compound is iodyl periodate, an iodine(V,VII) oxide approximating IO2+IO4\u2212.

    "Library in Thorold, Ontario\nThe library in 2024\nThe Thorold Public Library is a building in Thorold, Ontario, located on 14 Ormond Street North.\nHistory\nThorold's first library was a private institution that opened in 1858. 110 patrons paid the $1 membership fee for access to the 600 books in the library's collection. This library ceased to exist in 1867. It was replaced by another library in 1869. This second library kept the same $1 membership fee until 1895, when it was discounted to half the price in an effort to grow its customer base. The library continued to struggle and eventually asked the city to take over its collection of 5,000 books. Under the city's ownership, it became a public library. Thorold was approved for a Carnegie Library grant and a new building opened in 1912. This library operated until 1983 and was replaced by the current location attached to Chestnut Hall. In 2012, Chestnut Hall was assessed by a historical society that determined it was \"badly showing its age\" and may also be at risk of a fire due to damaged wiring.\nIn 2020, Thorold's city council considered creating an additional branch to the Canada Games Park but ultimately decided against it due to plans to expand the current building. These renovations are expected to cost somewhere between six and eight million dollars. Plans for a branch in the south of the city, which was deemed to be a more suitable location, were discussed but with no definitive plans.\nIn 2022, the library stopped issuing fines to patrons in order to improve access for those experiencing financial difficulties. In 2023, patrons of the library borrowed 60,621 physical items. That same year, the library digitized newspaper clippings from the 1870s onwards. The library offers access to laptops and internet hotspots. Library patrons may also borrow items in other libraries through the Libraries in Niagara Co-operative program.\nSee also\nSt. Catharines Public Library\nNiagara Falls Public Library (Ontario)\nList of libraries in Ontario\nReferences\n^ \"Hours/Contact Information\".

    "Boxing match\nTim Witherspoon vs. Frank Bruno was a professional boxing match contested on 19 July 1986, for the WBA heavyweight title.\nBackground\nTim Witherspoon had captured his second world title after narrowly outpointing reigning WBA heavyweight champion Tony Tubbs in a close majority decision victory on January 17, 1986. Shortly after his victory, Witherspoon ran into trouble after a post-fight drug test revealed traces of marijuana in his system. Facing a possible suspension and being stripped of his title, Witherspoon admitted to smoking a single joint in November while celebrating with friends after signing the contract for the title shot against Tubbs and stated \"I would never know it would trace up so many months later.\" Witherspoon, his promoter Don King and manager Carl King were first summoned to go before the Georgia Boxing Commission to explain the positive test after which Witherspoon was issued a one-year probation and a $500 fine. Witherspoon would then face a disciplinary hearing with the WBA in March. Though Tubbs and his team insisted Witherspoon be stripped of the title, WBA president Gilberto Mendoza opted to keep Witherspoon as champion and instead to issued him a $25,000 fine and ordered a Witherspoon\u2013Tubbs rematch. The winner of the rematch was to then grant a title match to Frank Bruno, the top-ranked heavyweight contender, within 90 days.\nThe undefeated Bruno had been in talks to face Witherspoon in his native UK since Witherspoon's victory over Tubbs in January, but first needed to win a WBA \"eliminator\" bout against ex-WBA heavyweight champion Gerrie Coetzee on March 4, 1986. Bruno would dispatch Coetzee less than two minutes of action, winning by first-round knockout, officially becoming the WBA's top contender and entered in negotiations to face Witherspoon that July. Though Tubbs was still owed a rematch against Witherspoon, Tubbs agreed to step aside in favor of Bruno after being paid $250,000 and being promised a match that fall against the winner of the Witherspoon\u2013Bruno fight. However, the fight was put in jeopardy after a dispute between rival British television stations ITV and BBC regarding who would broadcast the fight in the UK where the fight was set to take place. Don King and Butch Lewis had already sold the rights to their entire Heavyweight World Series (in which a series of heavyweight title matches were organized to determine an undisputed heavyweight champion) but Bruno's promoter Mickey Duff already had a longstanding agreement with BBC allowing the channel to exclusively broadcast fights that included his stable of fighters. HBO, who held the rights for the American broadcast, feared the fight would be cancelled and thus had a contingency plan in place that would see the Witherspoon\u2013Tubbs rematch take place on the same date somewhere in the United States with Bruno facing the winner in the fall. The fight was saved on the last minute when both stations agreed to share the TV rights, with HBO agreeing to work with both in regards to producing the telecast. The fight was a major box office success, selling over 40,000 tickets, setting a then-record as the most attended boxing fight in the UK, surpassing the 1966 Ali\u2013Cooper II fight which sold 39,000 tickets.\nThe fight\nThough both fighters were regarded for their impressive knockout power, the fight was a largely tactical affair until the 11th round. Witherspoon had a slight lead on all three scorecards at the time of the stoppage (a 2-point lead on one and 3-point lead on the other two) with five rounds being declared a draw on one scorecard, four rounds being declared a draw on another and one round on the final scorecard. Bruno was only able to win no more than two rounds according to the judges while Witherspoon had taken five, four and three rounds on the three. Then in the 11th round, Witherspoon scored a big right hand that sent Bruno staggering into the corner as Witherspoon closed in and threw more powerful right. Bruno escape the corner but Witherspoon landed three consecutive overhand rights to send Bruno on the seat of his pants in another corner. Bruno's corner threw in the towel signifying surrender and the referee halted the fight with three seconds remaining in the round giving Witherspoon the TKO victory.\nAftermath\nThe Witherspoon Tubbs rematch was set for 12 December however Tubbs pulled out citing a shoulder injury and was replaced with James Smith.\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For WBA heavyweight title\nBroadcasting\nReferences\n^ \"Tim Witherspoon vs. Frank Bruno\". boxrec.com.

    "Record breaking heat event beginning in April\nIn 2024, Japan experienced excessive heat beginning in April, which led to at least 59 heat-related deaths and at least 62 temperature observation posts across Japan breaking temperature records in July. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the average temperatures reached during the heat waves represented the hottest for Japan in April and July since its record-keeping began in 1898.\nMeteorology\nAccording to the JMA, the heatwave in July was caused by a high-pressure area stationing over the Pacific Ocean coupled with the movement of warm air from Southern Japan into its northern regions. On 2 August, The high-pressure system moved over a region ranging from Okinawa to Tohoku.\nHeatwave\nAccording to the JMA, April 2024's average temperature throughout Japan was 2.76\u00b0C higher than the average annual April temperature, making it the hottest April since JMA records began in 1898.\nIn June 2024, Shizuoka Prefecture became the first Japanese prefecture to reach and surpass 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) in 2024.\nIn July 2024, temperatures in Japan reached 2.16\u00b0C higher than its July averages, breaking the record set in July 2023 at 1.91\u00b0C higher. On 29 July, temperatures reached 41\u00a0\u00b0C (106\u00a0\u00b0F) at Sano in Tochigi Prefecture, and met or exceeded 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) in six other locations that included Hamamatsu in Shizuoka Prefecture.\nOn 2 August, Totsukawa, Nara Prefecture reached 39.9\u00a0\u00b0C (103.8\u00a0\u00b0F); Dazaifu, Fukuoka Prefecture reached 39.3\u00a0\u00b0C (102.7\u00a0\u00b0F); and Hirakata, Osaka Prefecture reached 39.1\u00a0\u00b0C (102.4\u00a0\u00b0F). In Western Japan, six weather observation points recorded all-time high temperatures.\nJapan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency reported that between 1-21 July, 24,300 people throughout Japan were hospitalized due to heatstroke, with 9,078 of whom were hospitalized from 15 to 21 July alone. Of these, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare found that construction workers accounted for the greatest portion of recorded deaths due to their exposure to outdoor heat while performing extensive manual labor.\nHakodate City recorded the most days with >30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) temperatures since recording started in 1872. Excessive heat caused widespread impacts to agriculture, including \"dozens of tons\" of pumpkins that need to be disposed of as a result of discoloration caused by intense, prolonged sunlight. 10 million in JPY was lost due to farmers discarding roughly 60,000 corn plants to keep prices stable following excess yield. Many farms had 700\u2013800\u00a0kg (1,500\u20131,800\u00a0lb) of tomatoes per day fall below market standards due to the heat, causing many farmers to abandon tomato farming.\nImpact\nFrom April 2024 to the end of July, at least 59 people were killed by heat-related illnesses.\nIn July 2024, in anticipation of continued excessive heat and predictions of greatly increased air conditioner use, Japan's government reinstated its gas and electricity subsidies beginning in August. The subsidies were planned to be reinstated for three months, although Japan's Policy Research Council urged the government to have it last until the end of 2024.\nSeveral schools in Japan have begun implementing daily health assessment forms for students to record their body temperature, diet, water intake, and hours of sleep to monitor for heat stroke susceptibility. Many schools also had students wear watches that could alert them if their core temperature exceeded 38\u00a0\u00b0C (100\u00a0\u00b0F), provided them with cooling packs before exercise, and provided them rest in air-conditioned rooms for fifteen minutes following exercise periods of thirty minutes.\nOn 2 August, the JMA and the Japanese Environment Ministry issued heatstroke warnings to 36 of Japan's 47 prefectures.\nOn 6 August, Japanese authorities reported that in July, at least 123 people in the Greater Tokyo Area died as a result of heat-related illnesses. According to the Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office, most of the deceased were older than 60 years old. Only two had died while outdoors, and most had not been using air conditioning even though they had it installed. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency reported that over 37,000 people required hospitalization for treatment of heat stroke in July.\nSee also\n2023 Asia heat wave\n2022 Japan heatwave\n2018 Northeast Asia heat wave\nReferences\n^ a b c d e \"Japan sees hottest July since records began\".

    "British-bred thoroughbred racehorse\nGay Hermit (1883\u20131906?) was a British-bred thoroughbred racehorse and influential sire in Argentina.\nBackground\nGay Hermit was a bay stallion bred by J. Crowther and M. Harrison, sired by Hermit out of Doll Tearsheet, who would later produce Epsom Derby winner Merry Hampton.\nGay Hermit had a \"very sound constitution\" and was considered very handsome.\nGay Hermit was sold for 800 guineas as a yearling.\nRacing career\nAs a two-year-old in 1885, Gay Hermit was considered \"a useful second-class horse\". He was engaged in 69 races and won 7, earning \u00a34,930.\nAfter winning the Woodcote Stakes, Gay Hermit was soundly beaten in the Whitsuntide Plate by Philosophy. In the Triennial Stakes, Gay Hermit was the only horse to face Philosophy, and he upset her and won by three-quarters of a length. In the Royal Stakes, Gay Hermit started as the even odds favorite, and he recovered from stumbling in the stretch to finish first in a dead heat with Exmoor. Gay Hermit then won the Biennial Stakes before finishing second again to Philosophy in the Lavant Stakes.\nGay Hermit won the Prince of Wales's Stakes for two-year-olds as the favorite. In the Champion Breeders' Foal Stakes, Gay Hermit finished fourth after showing distress at the distance. Gay Hermit ran second in the Champagne Stakes to Minting. In the Hopeful Stakes, Gay Hermit came up just in time to dead heat for first with Modwena, who had previously easily beaten him.\nIn the Dewhurst Plate, Gay Hermit was \"stale\" after his hard season and finished fifth behind the winner Ormonde. Following the race, odds of 20 to 1 for the Epsom Derby were offered on Gay Hermit.\nBy April 1886, Gay Hermit was said to have made \"vast improvement\".\nIn 1886, Gay Hermit ran second as he favorite in the Triennial Stakes, second in the Stockbridge Cup by a length and a half, won the Stockbridge Biennial Stakes by a length, finished unplaced in the Eclipse Stakes, won the Great Yorkshire Stakes by a length and a half, finished second to Whitelock in the Alexandra Plate by a length, and won the Triennial Produce Stakes by two lengths. He won three of six starts as a three-year-old. Gay Hermit broke down in the Doncaster Stakes.\nGay Hermit was a close second in the 1887 Liverpool Autumn Cup. He followed this performance with a win the Great Lancashire Handicap the next day.\nGay Hermit won 14 races in England.\nAt the end of 1887, Gay Hermit was purchased by Santiago Luro and exported to Argentina. There, he broke down while winning the Gran Premio Internacional (later known as the Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini).\nStud career\nGay Hermit was retired to stand stud at Haras Ojo de Agua after his injury. He was considered an excellent sire and an extraordinary damsire.\nGay Hermit led the Argentine general sire list four times, in 1896, 1897, 1898, and 1901. He led the Argentine broodmare sire list six times, 1910\u20131913, 1915, and 1916, and finished second in 1918 and third in 1914.\nGay Hermit was buried at Haras Ojo de Agua after his death.\nNotable progeny\nCordon Rouge, winner of the Gran Premio Nacional, Gran Premio Jockey Club, Cl\u00e1sico Eliseo Ram\u00edrez, Cl\u00e1sico Ignacio Correas, etc.\nValero, winner of the Gran Premio Nacional and Gran Premio Jockey Club\nBalcarce, winner of the Gran Premio Polla de Potrillos\nBerezina, winner of the Gran Premio Polla de Potrancas\nCelso, winner of La Copa, champion sire in Chile\nCitoyenne, winner of the Gran Premio Polla de Potrancas\nColombia, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n\nEspina, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n\nFedra, winner of the Gran Premio Polla de Potrancas\nGonin, champion sire in Chile\nTalma, winner of the Gran Premio Polla de Potrillos and Durban July Handicap\nTarantula, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n\nT\u00fanica, winner of the Cl\u00e1sico St. Leger, etc.\n\nNotable progeny of daughters\nLocandiera, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n and Gran Premio Polla de Potrancas\nParva, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n, Premio Ignacio Correas, etc.\nPart\u00edcula, winner of the Gran Premio Selecci\u00f3n\nElcano, winner of the Cl\u00e1sico General San Mart\u00edn\nEnero, winner of the Cl\u00e1sico Comparaci\u00f3n\nMagda, winner of the Polla de Potrancas (Chile) and Cl\u00e1sico St. Leger\n\nPedigree\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h \"Gay Hermit (horse)\".

    "Linguist\nMaya Hickmann (born 19 May 1953 in Egypt; died 26 September 2019) was a linguist who specialized in language acquisition and psycholinguistics.\nEducation\nBorn in Egypt, Hickmann spent her early life in Paris. She studied in the US, obtaining first a BA in psychology at Cornell University in 1973, then an MA from the University of Chicago in 1975. Her PhD, awarded in 1982 by the same institution, dealt with the development of children's narrative skills and discourse cohesion, and was supervised by David McNeill.\nCareer and honours\nOn her return to Europe in 1981, Hickmann took up a position as staff scientist at the newly founded Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen under the direction of Wolfgang Klein. She spent ten years there, before moving to France in 1992 for a position at the Experimental Psychology Laboratory of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) based at Paris Descartes University. In 1998 she received her habilitation, and in 2000 she was promoted to senior scientist (directrice de recherche). From 2008 she was co-director of the Formal Structures of Language lab, which she and Clive Perdue had founded in 2007.\nIn 2008 Hickman was elected ordinary member of the Academia Europaea. In the same year she founded the journal Language, Interaction and Acquisition, building on the existing journal Acquisition et Interaction en Langue Etrang\u00e8re (Acquisition and Interaction in a Foreign Language; AILE) set up by Perdue.\nResearch\nHickmann's research took an experimental approach to big questions in psycholinguistics and language acquisition, especially acquisition by multilingual children. She was particularly interested in the development of discourse structure, and maintained research interests in linguistic typology and linguistic universals. She worked with both typically and atypically developing populations, and her work on the development of motion expressions and spatial expressions has been particularly influential.\nSelected publications\nKail, Mich\u00e8le, and Maya Hickmann. 1992.

    "\nUna Lynskey disappeared on 12 October 1971, while walking the short distance from the bus stop to her rural home in Ratoath, County Meath, Ireland. At 5:30 p.m., she left work from the Office of the Land Commission. She then boarded a bus in Busar\u00e1s; both Una Lynskey and her cousin got off the bus at 6:55 p.m. Her body was found two months later, close to the village of Glencullen in the Wicklow Mountains.\nRT\u00c9 reported that Martin Conmey, Dick Donnelly, and Martin Kerrigan were questioned by garda\u00ed. Reports said that screams were heard close to Porterstown Bridge in that evening. Martin Kerrigan was later abducted and killed by Una Lynskey's brothers Sean and James Lynskey and her cousin John Gaughan, nine days after Una Lynskey's body was discovered. Afterwards, Martin Kerrigan's body was found in Rathfarnham, Dublin, which is close to the site where Una Lynskey was found.\nDick Donnelly won an appeal against his conviction in 1973, but Martin Conmey's conviction was upheld, and he served three years in jail. In November 2010, the Court of Criminal Appeal overturned Martin Conmey's conviction.

    "Supreme Court of Canada case\nCanada (Attorney General) v. Power,  2024 SCC 26 is a 2024 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on the Crown's immunity for an action arising out of a legislature's enactment of legislation that is later found to be unconstitutional by a court. The decision has been widely criticized as undermining Canada's constitutional order and system of Westminster parliamentary democracy.\nBackground\nJoseph Power was convicted of two offences of sexual assault and sentenced to prison. After being dismissed from his job at a New Brunswick hospital when his criminal record came to light, he applied for a pardon (now known as a record suspension). His application was refused under the Limiting Pardons for Serious Crimes Act and the Safe Streets and Communities Act because of the nature of his crimes. The Act's transitional provisions were later struck down by the courts.\nPower sued for damages under section 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982.\nDecision\nIn a 5-2-2 decision, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the executive government could be held liable for Charter damages for preparing legislation that is later struck down by the courts, as well as for Parliament enacting legislation which is later struck down by the courts.\nKasirer and Jamal JJ would have held that the Crown enjoys absolute immunity for ministers and officials preparing and drafting a bill which is later found to be unconstitutional, but that damages are available for the legislature enacting such legislation.\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe JJ would have held that damages are available in neither situation.\nCommentary\nThe Supreme Court's decision has been extensively criticized. University of Ottawa law professor St\u00e9phane S\u00e9rafin called the judgment \"shocking\", writing that the Supreme Court \"effectively granted itself ultimate authority over the legislative process in this country\". Philippe Lagass\u00e9, an expert on the Crown and the Westminster system at Carleton University, wrote that the majority judgment in Power was \"all rather disconcerting\" and \"went against rulings as recent as 2018 in Mikisew, went against the principle that one part of the Constitution shouldn\u2019t invalidate another, and dissolved the essential distinction made between the Crown\u2019s capacities and those of legislative and executive offices\".\nLegal scholar Kerry Sun described the Court's judgment as exhibiting \"a striking misapprehension of Canada\u2019s constitutional architecture\" and commented that the decision was \"perhaps one of the Supreme Court\u2019s most expensive mistakes in recent history\".\nLegal commentator and lawyer Asher Honickman wrote the decision \"subverts\" the core constitutional principles of parliamentary privilege and parliamentary sovereignty.\nReferences\n^ SCC Case Information - Docket 40241 Supreme Court of Canada\n^ S\u00e9rafin, St\u00e9phane (July 24, 2024). \"St\u00e9phane S\u00e9rafin: Legal activists put the 'notwithstanding clause' at risk\".

    "American football player (born 1952)\nAmerican football player\nJimmie Dale Kennedy (born July 30,1952) is a former American football player who played for three seasons for the Baltimore Colts of the National Football League (NFL). Throughout his time in the NFL he was a blocking tight end used almost exclusively in short-yardage situations and on special teams as a coverage player on kickoff and punt returns. Kennedy played collegiately for Colorado State University after spending one semester at Hiram College.\nBiography\nEarly years\nJimmie Kennedy was born July 30, 1952, in Laurel, Mississippi. His family moved to Sandusky, Ohio during his childhood and he grew up in that city, attending Perkins High School.\nThe stout Kennedy played as a fullback in high school but never recorded gaudy offensive statistics. \"I've always been a blocker,\" he told the Baltimore Sun in 1976. \"I was a blocking fullback in high school \u2014 I never got a chance to run the ball because I was always blocking.\"\nThis ability would later prove a valuable career skill.\nCollege career\nKennedy first enrolled at Hiram University, a small, private liberal arts school in Ohio where he studied sociology. He transferred to Colorado State University after only one semester, however.\nKennedy was a starter for Colorado state during the 1972 and 1973 seasons \u2014 his junior and senior years, respectively. Once again, Kennedy found himself mostly opening running lanes for teammates, this time as a tight end. \"They didn't even know I could catch until my senior year, they had me blocking so much,\" he later recalled. He relished the role, noting, \"I like to block \u2014 I figure it's just me one-on-one with the dude across the line.\"\nDuring his time at CSU, Kennedy caught a total of 55 balls for 481 yards and 6 touchdowns. His performance as a senior earned him All-Western Athletic Conference honors in 1973.\nProfessional career\nKennedy was selected as a tight end by the Washington Redskins in the 9th round of the 1974 NFL draft. The late-round pick's chances of catching with the club was threatened by the emergence of legal troubles during the summer. The case, an assault charge in Fort Collins, Colorado, stemmed from a fight in an intramural basketball game played shortly before Kennedy graduated from CSU, was expedited at the request of defense counsel due to the coming of NFL training camp. After a short bench trial, on July 2 Judge William Smoke ruled in favor of the plaintiff, sentencing Kennedy to a six-months in jail and a $500 fine \u2014 with the jail term and all but $150 of the fine suspended.\nA photo of Kennedy's career-best 32-yard catch against Tampa Bay made the front page of the Baltimore Sun in 1976.\nHis legal difficulties behind him, Kennedy was able to attend Redskins training camp to attempt to make the newly-expanded 47-man roster. He was a rookie \"on the bubble,\" ultimately released by the Redskins two days before the start of the 1974 season, however. The free agent subsequently signed a deal with the Chicago Fire of the World Football League (WFL) on October 11, 1974.\nKennedy saw action in four games for the Fire, starting at tight end, but the financially troubled team breached his contract, making him once again a free agent.\nKennedy signed with the NFL's Baltimore Colts on April 16, 1975, and made the team's roster as a backup for the rugged Raymond Chester. He appeared in every Colts game of the 1975 and 1976 seasons, playing primarily on special teams and as an extra blocker in short yardage situations.\nSeldom used as an offensive weapon during his career, Kennedy scored his one career touchdown in 1975 against the Los Angeles Rams when he successfully grabbed a pass in the end zone from the 3-yard line. His career long came in 1976 against Tampa Bay, when he snagged a ball in heavy traffic from Colts quarterback Bill Troup and rambled for 32 yards, before being dragged down on the 5-yard line.\nAlways a solid blocker, Kennedy was also an effective special teams coverage player, making 7 tackles and 3 assists on kickoffs and punts during the 1976 season.\nThe league reduced its active roster from 47 players to 43 for the 1977 NFL season and Jimmie Kennedy was one of the victims of the change, falling on September 12, 1977, during the final round of cuts made by the Colts prior to the start of their season. His career was not quite done yet, however, as injury created opportunity and he was brought back by the team on October 20. Kennedy saw action in the last 9 games of the year.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g Howard M. Balzer (ed.), Football Register 1978.

    "Stephen Proctor or Procter (died 1619) was an English courtier, a minerals and financial speculator, and Yorkshire landowner who built Fountains Hall.\nLife\nFriar's Head Hall, Flasby with Winterburn (rebuilt in the 17th century).\nFireplace at Fountains Hall with the Judgement of Solomon\nProctor was a member of a family from Ripon and Friar's Head and Cowper Cote at Gargrave. In 1513, Stephen and Ralph and Roger Proctor of Flasby were mentioned in the Flodden muster. Gabriel Proctor was the receiver of Flasby and other manors (formerly the property of Furness Abbey) for the Duchy of Lancaster in 1556, when the Earl of Cumberland's servants attacked his family during a territorial dispute.\nHis father, Thomas Proctor (or Procter) is sometimes said to have made a fortune from a 1589 patent to smelt iron with wood, and he is known to have been a lead-mining entrepreneur. The iron patent was sold to Edward Fitton in 1592 and he later complained that it was worthless. In the 1540s, Thomas Proctor leased lead mines from Sir Arthur Darcy on Appletreewick Moors formerly the property of Bolton Abbey. The mines were operated by a consortium of merchants from York who sent the ore to Flanders and paid a rent to Proctor. This phase of business came to an end in 1549 when Sir John Yorke bought the manor of Appletreewick and evicted Proctor, his tenants, and his workers. A Chancery case over the crown lease of the Appletreewick (Greenhow) lead mines resulted, between John Yorke, knight, and Thomas Proctor of Cowpercote, yeoman.\nStatues of Mars and Saturn in niches at Fountains Hall\nStephen and his brother Elias Proctor were involved in some aspects of a family iron business, and Stephen's father-in-law, the court musician Ralph Green was an investor. For a time, they had a bloomery at Shipley and used a forge at Summerbridge, not far from the medieval iron-working site of Smelthouses. They used ironstone brought from Gildersome rather than any more local source. A blast furnace constructed at Shipley proved unsuccessful. Stephen Procter gained a patent from Elizabeth I for coal and ironstone at Fulwood, near modern day Huthwaite.\nBefore he bought the Fountains estate, Proctor lived at Warsill Grange, and at Westminster. Fountains Hall was built partly using stone taken from Fountains Abbey in the late 1590s after Proctor acquired the estate from Thomas and William Gresham for \u00a34,500. The inclusion of the lands of Bewerley, with its lucrative lead mines, in his purchase was disputed. Rivalry between landowners in exploiting the mineral resources of former monastic lands became the determinant of his career. Proctor placed a placed an image of Saturn on Fountains Hall, a planet associated with melancholy and the metallic element lead, and a figure of Mars, representing iron.\nThomas Proctor, probably his brother, lived at Cowper Cote in 1601, and was appointed a collector of the tax or subsidy. Stephen Proctor was knighted by James VI and I in March 1604. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in November 1605. Prince Charles travelled to London from Dunfermline Palace with his physician Henry Atkins in July 1604 and they stopped at Fountains Hall.\nProctor worked on the leases of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby following an inheritance dispute, and supported Robert Cecil to gather and improve crown revenue from lands and woods. The King gave Proctor \"free gifts\" of money in 1609 and 1610.\nReligion and country house drama\nAn author, Thomas Bell, formerly a Catholic, after his conversion dedicated his Christian Dialogue (1609) to members of the Yorkshire Puritan gentry, including Proctor, Timothy Whittingham, Timothy Hutton, and the exchequer official Vincent Skinner.\nProctor argued with William Ingleby, who sided with tenants and villagers at Kirkby Malzeard who dismantled his enclosure made on the common land of Grewelthorpe Moor where he had commenced mining for coal. The village activists included 31 women led by Dorothy Bayne, known as Captain Bayne. Proctor's title was strengthened by a deal made by the Earl of Derby. Proctor had captured a priest, Christopher Wharton, within Ingleby's park at Ripley Castle in 1598.\nProctor seems to have been anxious about his neighbour's religious beliefs, suspecting that Sir John Mallory supported a Catholic seminary in Studley Royal Park. A convicted and condemned burglar, David Paler or Paley, in prison at York Castle, alleged that Mallory pretended that he hosted priests in his park, so that his keepers could accidentally kill Proctor as a poacher, if he came to investigate at night. Paler mentioned other enemies, and Proctor's involvement with properties having disputed title due to the Earl of Derby's inheritance.\nIn August 1609, Proctor and Timothy Whittingham were involved in the capture of the Catholics John Mush and Matthew Flathers at Upsall Castle. Proctor investigated Sir John Yorke (1566\u20131635) of Nidderdale and Gowlthwaite Hall (a relation of William Ingleby) after hearing of thea",
    "2022 slavery monument in the Netherlands\nSlavernijmonument (Slavery Monument) in the Dutch city of Tilburg commemorates the Netherlands' history of slavery. The sculpture, depicting a girl sitting on \"broken chains\", was designed by the artist duo Dedden & Keizer. It was unveiled on July 1, 2022, at the Burgemeester Stekelenburg square in Tilburg's Spoorzone area.\nDescription\nThe monument is made of bronze and features two broken links symbolizing the chains of slavery being broken. This represents the (legal) abolition of slavery in the Netherlands on July 1, 1863, also known as Ketikoti or Emancipation Day. A girl, realistically sculpted but larger than life, sits on the horizontal link. With her eyes closed and one hand on the chain, she connects with the past in a moment of reflection. The trail of golden beads symbolizes the glass beads used as currency during the era.\nCreation\nTilburg is home to many descendants of enslaved people from Suriname and the former Dutch Caribbean. The first official commemoration of the abolition of slavery was held in Tilburg's Freedom Park on July 1, 2018. During this event, Mayor Weterings promised a slavery monument would be erected in the park. In 2020, initial steps were taken by a working group with the support of the cultural organization Kunstloc Brabant. The city, in consultation with this group, decided to place the monument at Burgemeester Stekelenburg square, behind the newly renovated Tilburg Centraal Station. The space in Freedom Park was deemed too limited for future commemorative ceremonies. This decision was final. The selection committee invited three artists to submit a design proposal. In 2021, Tilburg residents voted online for their favorite design. The winning design, by Dedden & Keizer, tells a story of 'captivity and suffering' while also being 'hopeful and forward-looking,' according to the committee.\nUnveiling\nOn July 1, 2022, the monument was unveiled as the first slavery monument in North Brabant by Mayor Weterings and the King's Commissioner Ina Adema, along with the girl who modeled for the sculpture. In his speech, the mayor described the monument as a powerful symbol \"so that we do not forget what was done to people who were once enslaved\" and \"acknowledge that racism still has roots in society.\"\nIn January 2023, the slavery monument was vandalized with white paint. The city of Tilburg filed a police report.\nSee also\nHistory of slavery in the Netherlands\nReferences\n^ a b \"Slavernijmonument onthuld: burgemeester zegt dat hij het verleden betreurt\".
