    "Pakistan\u2019s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has now been behind bars for a year \u2013 although there are times you would barely know it.\nMr Khan is still the dominant force of Pakistan\u2019s opposition politics; his name still in the papers and the courts. His social media supporters have been unrelenting.\nWith no public appearances, the few people allowed in to see the former cricket star regularly \u2013 his lawyers and family \u2013 have become his conduit for messages to the outside world. They are keen to push the message that his 365 days behind bars have left him unbowed.\n\u201cThere is still a swagger about him,\u201d Aleema Khanum, Imran Khan\u2019s sister, says. \u201cHe\u2019s got no needs, no wants - only a cause.\u201d\nAccording to those who visit him, Mr Khan spends his days on his exercise bike, reading and reflecting. He has an hour a day to walk around the courtyard. There have been occasional disagreements about how quickly the family can provide him with new books.\n\u201cHe has said \u2018I\u2019m not wasting a minute of my time in jail, it\u2019s an opportunity for me to get more knowledge\u2019,\u201d Ms Khanum tells the BBC.\nBut the fact is Mr Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi are still trapped in prison, with no sign they will be released any time soon.\nAccording to some, this is not a surprise.\n\u201cThere was no expectation that Mr Khan was going to do anything that would make it easy for him to get out of jail,\u201d says Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Centre think tank in Washington.\nAnd the military - Pakistan\u2019s powerful behind-the-scenes player - \u201cdon\u2019t ease up when they decide there\u2019s a political figure that they want to lock up\u201d, says Mr Kugelman. \u201cThat has especially been the case with Khan.\u201d\nIndeed, the military has been key to many of the ups and downs of Mr Khan\u2019s life in the last decade. Many analysts believe it was his initial close relationship with the military establishment which helped him win power.\nBut by 9 May last year, that was in tatters. Mr Khan - who had been ousted from power in a vote of no confidence in 2022 - had been arrested, and his supporters came out to protest.\nSome of those protests turned violent, and there were attacks on military buildings - including the official residence of the most senior army official in Lahore which was looted and set alight.\nIn the aftermath, BBC sources said Pakistan\u2019s media companies had been told to stop showing his picture, saying his name or playing his voice.\nMr Khan was released - but ultimately only for a few months.\nHe was jailed again on 5 August for failing to correctly declare the sale of state gifts - and that was just the start.\nIn the run-up to the election, the cases against him mounted; by the start of February - just days before the vote - the 71-year-old had acquired three long prison sentences, the last for 14 years.\nBy the election, many of the candidates standing for Mr Khan's PTI party were also in prison or in hiding, the party stripped of its well-recognised symbol of a cricket bat -  a vital identifier in a country with a 58% literacy rate.\nDespite this, \u201cwe were determined and wanted to make a statement\u201d, Salman Akram Raja, Mr Khan\u2019s lawyer and a candidate in the election, says. \n\u201cIt was very constrained, many couldn\u2019t campaign at all. The loss of the cricket bat symbol was the body blow.\u201d\nAll candidates stood as independents, but hopes - even within the party - weren\u2019t high.\nYet candidates backed by Imran Khan won more seats than anyone else, forcing his political rivals to form an alliance to block them. The PTI, meanwhile, was left to fight for many of their seats in court, alleging the results were rigged.\nSupporters see the election on 8 February as a turning point, proof of Mr Khan\u2019s potent message - even from behind bars.\n\u201cThere is a change, that was expressed on 8 February,\u201d says Aleema Khanum. \u201cChange is coming, it is in the air.\u201d\nOthers say that practically, the result hasn\u2019t changed the status quo.\n\u201cWe are really where we might expect to be given past precedent,\u201d Mr Kugelman says. \n\u201cPTI didn\u2019t form a government, its leader is still in jail and the coalition in power is led by parties backed by the military.\u201d\nBut more recently, things have certainly seemed to be looking up for Mr Khan and his supporters.\nAll three of the sentences handed down just before the election have fallen away, a United Nations panel declared his detention was arbitrary and Pakistan\u2019s supreme court said PTI was an official party and should receive \"reserve seats\"; the seats reserved for women and non-Muslims allocated according to the proportion of seats the party has won.\nBut none have yet had a practical impact: Mr Khan is still in jail with new cases against his name, and the reserve seats have yet to be allocated.\nHis wife Bushra Bibi, whose prison sentence was dropped when the case that declared their marriage illegal was appealed, is also still in prison on new charges.\nMeanwhile, the government has made it clear that it sees Mr Khan and his party as a public",
    "The family of a child who claim they were emotionally and physically abused by a paedophile head teacher are taking legal action against the local education authority.\nNeil Foden, 66, from Old Colwyn in Conwy county, was jailed for 17 years after being found guilty of 19 charges of sexual abuse involving four girls over a four-year period last month.\nThese included 12 counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of sexual activity with a child while he was in a position of trust.\nThe action being taken against the local council, Cyngor Gwynedd, involves a child who was not part of the criminal trial.\nFoden started working at Ysgol Friars in Bangor in 1989 and became head teacher in 1997. He was also the strategic head of another school.\nDuring his trial at Mold Crown Court, it was revealed that concerns were raised with Cyngor Gwynedd's then director of education, Garem Jackson, over Foden's solo meetings with one of the victims in 2019, which the council did not formally investigate.\nFoden had also previously been found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct in 2020, after the Education Workforce council panel heard allegations against him from three members of staff.\nNow a law firm which specialises in investigating and claiming compensation for victims of childhood abuse is appealing for anyone who suffered abuse of any kind by Foden to come forward.\nNorth Wales head teacher Neil Foden abused teenage girls over a four-year period, but could he have been stopped? \nWatch on i-Player\n\nSolicitor Katherine Yates said the case \"raises a lot of questions\".\n\"There seems to be a long history of complaints against Foden, so why wasn't anything done sooner?\" she said.\nCyngor Gwynedd said it was \"appalled\" by Foden's actions and its \"thoughts continue to be with the victims and their families\".\nBut it said it could not comment further while a review of the case is under way.\nIt said the North Wales Safeguarding Board had begun to carry out a children's practice review, which is led by an independent chair and two experienced reviewers, in accordance with Welsh government guidelines.\n\"The review will bring together organisations such as Cyngor Gwynedd, relevant schools and other bodies to identify what lessons are to be learned and what improvements need to be introduced to ensure the safety and well-being of vulnerable children and to prevent similar cases from happening again.\n\"Until all this independent review has been completed, it would not be appropriate for Cyngor Gwynedd to comment further.\"",
    "In a scorching-hot week, there has been a variety of news stories dominating the headlines here in the West. \nThe week kicked off with the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announcing cuts in a bid to save billions of pounds and plug a gap in public finances. \nThe controversial two-mile tunnel road near Stonehenge was among the scrapped plans - some welcomed the decision, calming fears over the impact on the World Heritage Site, whilst others disagreed with the move, citing bottleneck traffic along the A303. \nBenjamin Paessler from the Gazette and Herald gathered reaction to the announcement on Monday.  \nOn the same day, across the border in Somerset, emergency services descended on a street in Bath over fears of a \"noxious substance\".\nTwo people began feeling unwell after a woman approached them with a bag, prompting a police cordon and investigation.  \nA 73-year-old woman was arrested in connection with the incident, but has since been released under investigation. No hazardous substance was found, police said. \nBath Echo went to the scene to capture pictures. \nIn Bristol, residents of a tower block in St Pauls were evacuated after a ceiling collapsed in an underground car park. \nTristan Cork and Shania King-Soyza from Bristol Live kept readers updated with a live page whilst the incident unfolded. \nThe team gathered reaction and spoke to emergency services about what happened that night. \nOne resident said the roof \"all came down as one big sheet\".\nIn happier news, the Olympics kicked off in Paris last Friday. \nTeam GB athletes with links to this part of the world have already secured a number of medals. \nMonday saw Gloucestershire's Laura Collett seal the first British gold medal as the eventing squad won the team competition at the Chateau de Versailles, Gloucestershire Live reported.\nOn Tuesday, all eyes were on the La Defense Arena pool where Team GB swimmers won Olympic Gold in stunning 4x200m freestyle relay victory, as reported by Somerset Live. \nScottish swimmer Duncan Scott, Bath-based Tom Dean and Millfield training partners Matt Richards and James Guy retained their 4x200m freestyle relay title and won the team's first swimming gold medal of the games. \nOther medals from the West included a bronze from \"overjoyed\" rower Rebecca Wilde from Taunton and a silver for Cheltenham's Tom George.\nBack in the UK, residents at Wentworth Court Nursing Home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, participated in their very own Olympic games, equipped with handmade medals and their very own Olympic torch. \nBBC Gloucestershire shared a glimpse of what they have been up to on Facebook. \nNational Highways released aerial shots of ongoing work on the A417 Missing Link in Gloucestershire, as the scheme entered its second year of construction this week. \n'Significant strides' are being made between Brockworth and Cowley, as reported by Gloucestershire Live's Phil Norris. \nThe project aims to ease traffic congestion, enhance safety measures and bolster economic prosperity in the region. \nMeanwhile, fans of Agatha Christie will be thrilled to hear that filming is underway on a Netflix adaptation of The Seven Dials Mystery. \nBristol Live spotted Martin Freeman on the set down Bridewell Street in Bristol on Tuesday.  \nOn Wednesday, the production headed to Bath, with Somerset Live dropping in to catch a glimpse at the action. \nThe cast also includes Mia McKenna-Bruce, Helena Bonham Carter and Edward Bluemel.

    "\"Dodgy sites\" which are reselling driving tests to learner drivers for a profit are \"unacceptable\", according to the UK's transport secretary.\nMany learner drivers are fed up with waiting times, so they are booking practical tests through brokers who block-book and re-sell the tests for hundreds of pounds.\nTransport Secretary Louise Haigh said tackling the test backlog was a \"key priority\" for the Labour government.\nThe Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) said it was encouraging learners only to book tests through the official government website.\nRe-selling a test isn't illegal but the DVSA said it \"exploits\" learners.\nThe latest figures show the average wait time to book a test across England, Scotland and Wales is four-and-a-half-months.\nDelays are down to an increase in demand and learners booking tests before they are ready to pass, according to the DVSA.\nThrough the official DVSA website, a driving test costs \u00a362.\nMany brokers use an automated software to block-book driving test slots on the government website and then sell them on. \nThe companies use \u2018bots\u2019 which input data more quickly than a human can, so they\u2019re able to secure test dates before those without the software.\nBBC producer Nayana Mena booked her test through a broker on Snapchat. \nShe paid \u00a3150 which meant she was able to take a test within a couple of weeks.\nShe said: \"I felt like I was a pawn in this game and so many of my friends and peers have gone through similar experiences.\"\nNayana says she nearly fell victim to a scam after another broker asked her for her bank details.\nShe failed twice before passing, so relied on brokers to get her new practical tests quickly.\n\"I spent in the thousands almost across a year and it was really frustrating. I cried to my friend about it and I was really close to giving up driving,\" she added.\nThe DVSA said 8.2% of learners were booking a practical test before taking any driving lessons.\nThe government agency is advising learners to only book their test after they've had sufficient on-road experience.\nAn additional 145,000 tests were made available by the DVSA between October 2023 and March 2024 to try to tackle the backlog.\nBut 65,534 driving tests were cancelled in the year up to March 2024 due to annual leave, industrial action, bad weather, examiner sickness and coronavirus.\nIn the previous year 118,232 tests were cancelled.\nTests can be booked by anyone with a provisional licence number, or an approved driving instructor (ADI).\nThe test time, location and provisional licence number can be changed at any time, making it easy to rebook or re-sell driving test slots.\nThe BBC has seen evidence on a number of WhatsApp groups where brokers offer test dates within a few days, often for more than \u00a3200.\nThe DVSA said it was using artificial intelligence to try to stop automated systems from block-booking tests, but admitted technology develops very quickly.\nSince January 2023, 283 DVSA test-booking accounts have been given warnings, 746 have been suspended and 689 have been been closed.\nA further 4,700 accounts have been removed which were not linked to ADIs.\nAva Devlin, 18, from Tunbridge Wells, was blocked out of the DVSA booking site because she would check the system for a test multiple times a day.\nAn error message would prevent her from being able to log onto the system.\nAfter months of trying she was finally able to book a practical test in London, 40 miles (64km) from her local test centre in Kent.\nShe moved the test to her local centre when a cancellation came up, but the test was cancelled on the day and she wasn't given a reason why.\nShe passed in March this year.\nAva said: \"There are so many actual teenagers that are logging onto the website trying to get a test but to know there are corporations logging in and block booking tests, why can\u2019t the people who actually want to take the test do that themselves and why does the price have to be so much?\n\u201cThe bots booking them in the first place is horrible and then the fact they can\u2019t even flog them off for a few hundred pounds, it really makes me angry.\n\u201cIt feels really unhuman,\" she added.\nFormer driving instructor Richard Ahsam, 59, from St Leonards, quit his \"stressful\" job after 20 years in the industry.\nHe said: \u201cAs a driving instructor you become obsessed with making sure your diary is available.\n\u201cThere were too many things against being able to give the job the way I wanted to give the job, it\u2019s very difficult when someone\u2019s saying they need a test and you have to tell them you can\u2019t get one for another six months. Loads of pupils are missing out.\"\nTeresa Allen, 67, a driving instructor of 17 years from Tonbridge, said the government should change the rules so only instructors can book tests on behalf of their pupils.\nShe said: \"It's demoralising. People are using brokers and apps and they are paying well over the odds for a test and then they can't take the test because they've got no one to take them, so the test goes to waste.\" ",
    "A British-Mexican man convicted of drug charges in Qatar and detained there for several months has been allowed to return to the UK.\nManuel Guerrero Avi\u00f1a, a gay man, says he was targeted purely based on his sexuality and that his detention was \"a breach of [his] human rights.\"\nThe 44-year-old was arrested in February in what his family called a \"honeytrap operation\" involving the gay dating app Grindr, and was given a six-month suspended sentence plus a \u00a32,100 fine, against which he unsuccessfully tried to appeal.\nQatar insists Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a's case was solely about the possession of drugs, which his family say were planted on him during the arrest.\nA statement posted on X said that the former airline manager, who is HIV positive and claims he was not given regular access to his usual medication, was travelling to the UK for treatment for a few days before going on to Mexico.\nThe Manuel Guerrero Committee - a group formed by Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a's family to campaign for his release - said they were glad he was free from the \"claws of the homophobic state of Qatar\".\nThey also thanked the people of Mexico and Britain, as well as the wider LGBT community and the media, for their support.\nThey said: \"Manuel and his family thank you for your tireless support in this emblematic struggle against injustice, against homophobia and in favour of human rights for all people.\"\nJames Lynch, co-director of human rights organisation FairSquare, who is also a former British diplomat in Qatar, said the incident had been a \"horrendous ordeal\" for Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a.\nHe said: \"I don\u2019t underestimate how much of a toll this experience will have taken on him. \n\"Amongst other things, he went through a terribly unfair trial that UN experts have raised serious concerns about, and was deprived of his HIV medication in prison.\n\"I hope he can find time and space in the coming weeks and months for rest and recovery.\"\nMr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a's family previously told the BBC that he was using Grindr in February and arranged to meet a man at his apartment in Doha.\nHowever, when he went to the lobby to meet the man, he was detained by Qatari police officers, despite having no previous criminal record, they said.\nHis brother claimed that Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a had methamphetamine planted on him and was then \"pressured\" into accepting it was his.\nAt a hearing in Doha in June, Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a was found guilty of being in possession of an illegal substance and given the fine.\nAfter an unsuccessful appeal, he has now been given permission to leave the country.\nHomosexuality is illegal in Qatar, with punishments including fines and prison sentences.\nBBC News has contacted Qatari officials for comment and is awaiting a response.\nA Qatari official has previously insisted that his arrest was on the basis of possession of illegal substances and that \u201cno other factors were taken into account\u201d.\nThey said Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a had been treated with dignity and respect, and that a test had confirmed the presence of drugs in his system at the time of his arrest.\nAmnesty International described his treatment in custody and trial as \u201cutterly horrific\u201d.\nThe Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that both British and Mexican diplomatic staff accompanied Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a to Hamad International Airport in Doha for his flight back to the UK.\nThey also thanked the British government for its support during his time in detention.",
    "Police officers faced \"serious and sustained levels of violence\" after hundreds of people rioted in Sunderland on Friday night.\nNorthumbria Police said three of its officers were injured during the unrest and needed hospital treatment.\nEight people have been arrested after a police building was ransacked and a Citizens Advice premises next door to it was set alight.\nBeer cans and bricks were thrown at riot police outside a mosque and cars were set on fire during the disorder.\nIt is the latest episode of unrest to break out in towns and cities across England following the killing of three young girls in Southport on Monday. \nNorthumbria Police Ch Supt Helena Barron said officers had been met with \"serious and sustained\" levels of violence, which was \"utterly deplorable\". \nShe said a full investigation was under way to identify those responsible for any criminal behaviour.\n\"I want to make it absolutely clear that the disorder, violence and damage which has occurred will not be tolerated,\" Ch Supt Barron added.\nOf the three injured police officers, one has been discharged and two remain in hospital for further treatment, she said. \nSome members of the crowd could be heard shouting Islamophobic slurs and chanting in support of far-right activist Tommy Robsinson, founder of the now disbanded English Defence League (EDL).\nMr Yaxley-Lennon's X account has promoted false claims that the alleged Southport attacker had been an asylum seeker who recently arrived in the UK by boat. \nLewis Atkinson, Labour MP for Sunderland Central, said: \"Last night one of the flags on the street bore the reference to the North East Infidels, which is a Nazi offshoot from the North East chapter of what was the EDL.\"\nMounted police were deployed to Sunderland's city centre to push back demonstrators, some of whom were in masks.\nOfficers also had beer barrels thrown at them, as young men shouted: \"Whose streets? Our streets\".\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said criminals attacking the police would \"pay the price for their violence and thuggery\".\nTyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service confirmed it had been called out to the fire near the Sunderland Central Police office. \nRail and bus services were halted with Tyne and Wear Metro operator Nexus saying it had been asked by British Transport Police to close Sunderland Rail Station at around 22:15 BST.\nThe Omniplex cinema in the city was also forced to close during the evening in the interest of public and staff safety, it said. \nResidents said they could still hear police helicopters in the sky past midnight. \nMayor of the North East Kim McGuinness said rioters have caused \"significant damage\" to the city.\n\"They've set fire to a police station, to cars, they've looted shops, they've abused people in the street, they've attacked police officers and Sunderland will be feeling the effect of that,\" she told BBC Breakfast.\n\"These people do need to be dealt with, with the full force of the law - you cannot use other people's grief to commit crime and violence\".\nSunderland AFC posted on social media: \"Tonight\u2019s shameful scenes do not represent our culture, our history, or our people. \n\"Our great city is built on togetherness and acceptance, and Sunderland will forever be for all. We are stronger as one community.\"\nSunderland Central MP Lewis Atkinson said the police had his full support in response to the criminal \"thuggery\". \nA crowd of about 200 anti-racist protesters also gathered outside the Abdullah Quilliam Mosque in Liverpool on Friday night after rumours of a far-right protest there.\nThe group chanted: \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\".\nDirector of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said extra prosecutors had been called into work this weekend to deal with the disorder. \n\"We have deployed dozens of extra prosecutors who are working round the clock this weekend, supporting the police, and ready to make immediate charging decisions so that justice is swiftly delivered,\" he said. \nTowns and cities including London, Hartlepool, Manchester, and Aldershot have seen protests descend into violence following the Southport knife attack. \nIn response, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced a new national violent disorder programme to help clamp down on violent groups by allowing police forces to share intelligence.\nIn a televised speech on Thursday, Sir Keir said: \"These thugs are mobile, they move from community to community, and we must have a police response that can do the same.\"\nHe also condemned \"violent disorder, clearly whipped up online\".\n\"We will take all necessary action to keep our streets safe\", the PM said.\nThe BBC has identified at least 30 demonstrations being planned by far-right activists around the UK over the weekend, including a new protest in Southport.\nAdditional reporting by Jim Scott, Andy Watson and Bethany White.\nFollow BBC Sunderland on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "As he slipped the key card into the reader on his hotel room door and tried the handle - to no avail - he realised what he had done.\nFor years, Steven Murdoch, a security researcher at University College London, had taken care not to put tickets or cards with magnetic stripes in his pocket next to his smartphone. This is because the magnets in smartphones are sometimes strong enough to wipe the data on magnetic stripes.\nBut so-called magstripe hotel key cards are rare these days, increasingly superseded by contactless cards with radio frequency identification (RFID) chips inside them.\nAs such, during his hotel visit in January this year, Prof Murdoch forgot to take precautions and, he concludes, wiped his room key \u2013 having used it only once.\n\u201cI should have known better, this is the sort of thing I do know about,\u201d he says. Upon arriving back at reception, he realised he was not alone.\n\u201cThere was a queue of people with exactly the same problem as me,\u201d he recalls.\nThe magnetic stripe was invented by an IBM engineer in the 1960s \u2013 his wife was instrumental in the process as it was she who suggested melting a strip of magnetic tape onto a card using a clothes iron.\nIn the decades since, magstripes have been used on bank cards, rail tickets, IDs and even cards containing medical information, to set up hospital machines.\nBut that murky brown strip of plastic usually made with polluting heavy metals may not be around for much longer. \nFrom this year onwards, for instance, Mastercard will not require banks to put a magnetic stripe on debit and credit cards.\nFor ticketing, new technologies including printable barcodes and reusable contactless cards are considered more environmentally friendly and potentially more convenient. \nYou also can\u2019t wipe them by accidentally putting them too close to your iPhone.\nThere are, broadly, two kinds of magnetic stripe, called HiCo and LoCo. The latter is cheaper, less durable, and more susceptible to disruption from magnets, says Lee Minter, head of global operations at Nagels, which makes magstripe tickets and other products. Recently, the company investigated reports from a customer who said multiple magstripe tickets they had bought had got corrupted.\nMr Minter says he can\u2019t be 100% sure but he and his colleagues are of the opinion that it was caused by part of a circular magnet within the customer\u2019s iPhone.\n\u201cIt matched perfectly to the area which had been wiped,\u201d he says.\nIn response, Apple says: \"Smartphones and other items contain magnets or components that may have a risk of demagnetizing low coercivity cards. To prevent this from happening, users should keep these cards stored separately.\"\nWhile such disruption remains relatively rare, Mr Minter says that the magnetic stripe is declining in popularity either way. Of the five billion tickets Nagels prints every year, less than one-fifth now have magnetic stripes, he estimates.\nMr Minter is keen to stress the potential of thermally printed paper tickets, much like receipts, which are now being used in trials at multiple rail stations around the UK. These come with a QR code that can be used on ticket barrier scanners. There is a separate code on the back to stop people forging tickets.\nStuart Taylor, head of commercial development at Northern, a train operator, says 70% of his firm\u2019s customers now buy digital tickets and that Northern could axe the familiar orange-trimmed, magstripe-sporting versions in just five years\u2019 time.\n\u201cThere is a clear environmental benefit,\u201d says Mr Taylor. \u201cTimes change, I guess.\u201d\nNorthern is now trialling the thermally printed paper tickets made by Nagels as an alternative. There have been some issues with printer jams and the tickets getting stuck in ticketing machines but these problems have largely been addressed, says Mr Taylor.\nHe emphasises that there are no plans to withdraw paper tickets, nor to cut any staff involved in ticket sales.\nAre there any benefits to keeping magstripe cards or tokens around? \n\u201cNo,\u201d says Sue Walnut, product director for intelligent transportation systems at Vix Technology, bluntly. \nShe argues there are now so many different ways of validating a rail ticket - for example, QR codes presented on phone screens, tickets printed at home, prepaid contactless cards - that there is less need to retain magstripe technology than ever before.\nBut magstripe tickets and entry cards do slot conveniently into credit card holders in wallets and purses. The new paper tickets being trialled by Northern and other rail firms are larger. \u201cThey are a bit unwieldy and cumbersome,\u201d says Ms Walnut.\nMagstripe has hung around for so long partly because it is relatively cheap and the specifications for reading machines were put in place many decades ago, says Stephen Cranfield at Barnes International, which makes equipment for magnetic stripe testing.\n\u201cIf you took your card today and used it in a magstripe reader from 1970, it would still be able to read it,\u201d he says.\nHis firm has worked on a ",
    "A woman has told how she was forced at knifepoint to smoke crack by criminals who turned her home in Dundee into a drug den.  \nShe was a victim of cuckooing - the term used when someone's house is taken over for criminal activity, including dealing, storing or using drugs.\nThe woman told BBC Scotland News she was initially befriended by a couple who then took her phone and bank cards and stole money from her.\nDundee charity Positive Steps said the issue was \"rife\" in the city after 52 referrals for cuckooing cases in the last year.\nThe woman, who we are calling Laura, said she was kept a prisoner in her home for weeks and was tied up and threatened by the couple.\nShe said: \"The lady was sitting with a knife at my throat, and said if I didn't hand over the bank card, then I was getting my throat slashed.\n\"Or if it didn't take the pipe, then I would get a punch or whatever. \n\"I was too frightened to tell the police, I didn't know what to do.\"\nLaura said she was in constant fear of her life.\nShe said: \"I really thought they were going to kill me because they were force-feeding me crack cocaine.\n\"I was hallucinating, and I couldn't say no because I was bound and force fed it.\"\nLaura said that things became \"worse and worse\" as the weeks went by.\nShe said: \"I was too frightened to try and leave the house. \n\"If my door was locked, they would burst the door wide open. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, just didn't know what to do.\"\n\nCharity Positive Steps had 52 cuckooing referrals in Dundee last year, compared to 29 the year before.\nHowever, the picture across the country is difficult to assess, as Cuckooing is not recorded by police as a specific offence. \nThe term is used when someone's house is taken over for any criminal activity, which could include dealing drugs or sex work.\nIt takes its name from the Cuckoo bird - which is known for using the nests of other birds.\nLaura said another neighbour was also cuckooed by the same people.\nShe said: \"He had to flee his house. \n\"It was the same thing, but he actually got a massive hiding (beating).\n\"And this was just so they could use his house and his money to buy crack cocaine.\"\nLaura was rescued after one of the couple answered the phone which they had stolen from her.\nA family member told them to put Laura on the phone immediately and alerted the police.\nLaura said: \"If they hadn't done that, I don't think I'd be alive today.\"\nPolice referred Laura\u2019s case to Positive Steps, a charity for vulnerable adults, which helped her find new accommodation and regain her confidence.\nPositive Steps was recently awarded \u00a3344,000 to expand its cuckooing service.\nIt previously operated with only one dedicated staff member, Gillian Anderson.\nShe said: \"It's happening right across Dundee, people are even leaving their houses.\n\"We had a case where somebody jumped out of the window just to escape what was going on.\"\nMs Anderson said the majority of people targeted were vulnerable women, but men and professional people were also victims.\nShe said: \"They're very clever at what they do. \n\"I've had a certain person who was bought a drink in a bar and it came from there.\n\"Or they've wormed their way in through a friend. They get their foot in the door and it goes from there.\"\nMs Anderson said victims were subjected to various ordeals.\n\"Some people, like Laura, were bound and gagged. \n\"There's people that have lost everything in their house, the furniture, the white goods, their bank accounts are emptied. \n\"There's been sexual and physical assaults. \n\"Some people never go back and leave all their possessions. Some people have moved from Dundee, just to escape from it all.\"\nShe said Positive Steps would help victims find a new home.\nShe said: \"We work in partnership with the police.

    "Former first minister Humza Yousaf has said terminating a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens was his mistake. \nThe move led to the ex-SNP leader\u2019s resignation earlier this year as he faced motions of no confidence.\nMr Yousaf told an LBC event at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe he was considering whether to continue as an MSP.\nHe also said he could not say with \"certainty\" that his daughters would not be attacked because of the colour of their skin. \nMr Yousaf resigned as first minister in May as he faced motions of no confidence in him and his government.\nHe said at the time he had \"underestimated\" the level of hurt caused by his decision to end a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens in April.\nThe breakdown came after a Green backlash against the SNP government\u2019s decision to row back on climate targets and gender policies. It left the SNP with a minority administration at Holyrood.\nMr Yousaf said the relationship came under strain following an interview by Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie in which he says Mr Harvie refused to accept the Cass review into gender services for children in England was a scientific document.\nThe former first minster said ordinarily \"reasonable, supportive\" people in his party -and not only the \u201cusual malcontents\u201d - told him that Mr Harvie's comments had made the Bute House Agreement \u201cvery difficult to sustain\u201d.\nMr Yousaf then used an expletive to take full blame for the decision to end the deal with the Greens, adding: \"It was my choice.\u201d\nHe said he had calculated his administration could fend off opposition votes of no confidence with the support of Alba MSP Ash Regan.\nHe told the Edinburgh event that deal became \u201cimpossible\u201d when Alba leader and former first minister Alex Salmond proposed an electoral pact with the SNP.\n\u201cThere was no way I was going to play a part in rehabilitating Alex Salmond in the political bubble,\u201d he said.\nHe then said: \u201cI could have done a deal (with Alba) that went against my principles, that would have saved my skin.\n\u201cIt would have got me the votes I needed but I wasn\u2019t going to do that.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Alba Party said: \"There was no reference to an electoral pact in the proposals that would have saved Humza\u2019s job - he knows that because he described them as sensible at the time.\"\nAsked about the SNP's heavy general election defeat to Scottish Labour, Mr Yousaf said he accepted an \u201celement of responsibility\u201d.\nHe said that he was not dealt \u201cthe easiest hand\u201d after taking over from Nicola Sturgeon in March 2023.\n\u201cI think anybody who was a past leader of the SNP in recent years has got to reflect very seriously,\" he added. \nAsked if he would consider running for first minister again, the 39-year-old replied: \u201cNo.\u201d\nHe said he did not know if he would stand to be an MSP in the 2026 Holyrood election, telling LBC: \u201cI\u2019ll make that decision probably next year.\u201d\nMr Yousaf, Scotland's first ethnic minority leader, said earlier this week he had questioned whether he and his family have a future in Scotland or the UK due to Islamophobia.\nIt came after violent riots in other parts of the UK. \nHe said: \u201cScotland has not had race riots and long may that continue but let\u2019s not pretend Scotland doesn\u2019t have racism and Islamophobia. \n\"In fact, people in Scotland have been charged on numerous occasions and found guilty of racism, death threats, Islamophobia against me.\" \nMr Yousaf said he was not planning on leaving Scotland but that he and other Muslim people he had spoken to were considering their futures. \nHe added: \u201cCould I say that my daughters would be safe as people of colour, as Muslims?\n\"If the girls choose to wear a hijab in the future could I say that they won\u2019t get attacked because of the colour of their skin, or because of their faith? I can\u2019t say that with any certainty.\u201d\nMr Yousaf also branded Elon Musk \u201cone of the most dangerous men on the planet\u201d.\nThe billionaire owner has been highly critical of the UK authorities and the way the disorder has been handled.\nHe has come under fire for promoting a conspiracy theory about the UK building \"detainment camps\" on the Falkland Islands for rioters.\nHe later deleted the image from his page. Posted by the co-leader of the far-right Britain First party, the image was faked to look like it had come from the Daily Telegraph website. \nMr Musk has not acknowledged he published then deleted the post. The BBC has approached X for comment.\nMr Yousaf accused the tech entrepreneur of \"using his wealth to amplify the far right\". ",

    "The Welsh Conservative Senedd leader has been accused of engaging in \"Islamophobic race-baiting\" by a Muslim group.\nAndrew RT Davies wrote \"children should not be forced to eat halal school lunches\", in an article for GB News, after a constituent alleged she was told non-halal meat was not available at her daughter's school in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan.\nThe school said on social media \"the statement that all meat options are halal only is incorrect\".\nThe Muslim Council of Wales has accused Mr Davies' of \"ham-fisted attempts at dog-whistle racism\" which have \"real consequences on our streets\". Mr Davies has said he \"entirely\" rejects the criticism.\nThe article was posted on X, formerly Twitter, by controversial far-right activist and convicted criminal Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and was widely shared.\nIn the GB News article, Mr Davies said: \"Children shouldn\u2019t be forced to have to eat halal school lunches, but in the era of conformity, this common sense call is derided.\"\nThe Muslim Council of Wales has released a strongly-worded response, saying: \"Andrew RT Davies is engaging in Islamophobic race-baiting, at a time when we require politicians to be the voice of reason and show moral leadership.\"\nIt added: \"The ham-fisted attempts at dog-whistle racism may lead to more engagement online for Mr Davies, but have real consequences on our streets and in our mosques.\"\n\"Many Muslim children face bullying and discrimination in schools, and Mr Davies' public and misleading campaign on halal meat will undoubtedly have an impact on returning Muslim pupils in September.\"\nSouth Wales East Senedd member Natasha Asghar, a member of Mr Davies' shadow cabinet, told BBC Wales she had raised concerns with him.\nShe is one of two Muslims in the Conservative group in Cardiff Bay.\n\"As a member of the Conservative Party since 2010, I can categorically say that the party is not Islamophobic,\" she said.\n\"Anybody with any concerns of any kind can reach out to myself or any other members of the Senedd, we are not inapproachable. \n\"Right now I am striving for peace and on working tirelessly to create community cohesion and peace on our streets for everyone.\"\nIn a statement, Mr Davies said he had contacted the local authority on behalf of his constituent asking for assurances that the choice of a non-halal meat option would be provided.\n\"These were legitimate questions and as an elected member, I fulfilled my responsibilities by asking them,\" he said.\n\"Attempts to equate those legitimate concerns with the disorder we\u2019ve seen on our streets is particularly irresponsible.\n\"Just as the thuggery we\u2019ve seen cannot be justified by legitimate concerns on political issues, those same concerns must not be ignored by political leaders.\n\"Doing so risks leaving the field clear for extremists to exploit for their own, dangerous ends.\"\nHe added: \"For my part, I will continue to engage with a broad range of individuals and organisations across all religious and community groups.\n\"This includes the Sikh constituents who welcomed the clarification I sought on school meals, as for religious reasons Sikhs cannot consume meat that has been ritually slaughtered.\n\"As a politician it is my job to take forward concerns raised by constituents, and I will continue to do so.\"\nSome members of the Conservative Senedd group have expressed concerns privately about Mr Davies' social media posts.\nOne said his posts were becoming increasingly \"difficult to defend\", adding that if things continue as they are then his position would become \u201cuntenable\u201d and he could face a leadership challenge.\nIt follows a post this week asking whether the Senedd should be abolished?\nSeveral senior party Senedd members, past and present, disagreed publicly with the post and asked why the question was being posed.\nMr Davies's predecessor as leader, Paul Davies, said on X: \"The Conservative Party is clear - it is not party policy to abolish the Senedd so not sure why this question is even being asked.\"\nFormer group leader Lord Nick Bourne, said: \"It has NEVER been the policy of the Welsh Conservative Party to abolish the assembly/Senedd.

    "When Lolita came to Australia in 2022, she was fleeing an older man she'd been forced to marry as a child in Saudi Arabia.\nShe told confidants she'd escaped a cycle of violence and sexual servitude so extreme it had repeatedly landed her in hospital.\nBut less than a year after her arrival, she vanished - last seen by a friend who claims he watched as she was taken from her apartment by a group of Saudi men in a black van.\nRecords show that Lolita, who is in her early 30s and goes by a single name, was put on a flight from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur in May 2023. From there, her lawyer believes she was returned to Saudi Arabia and detained.\nBut Lolita\u2019s exact whereabouts and safety - or whether she is even alive - remain unknown.\nIt's far from the first time the mysterious plight of a Saudi woman fleeing her homeland has ended up in the headlines.\n\u201cWhat makes this case particularly compelling, compared to some other cases of Saudi women who have disappeared\u2026 or turned up dead, is that we have a witness,\u201d says solicitor Alison Battisson.\nThe Saudi Arabian embassy in Canberra declined to comment. However, in a statement to the BBC, the Australian Federal Police said it became \u201caware\u201d of the alleged kidnapping in June and had \u201cstarted making immediate inquiries\u201d both within the country and \"offshore\".\nAdvocates fear Lolita's case is part of a growing trend in Australia, in which agents of other countries are monitoring, harassing or assaulting their expats with impunity. \nThe government has declared foreign interference - of all forms - its \u201cmost significant\u201d national security threat and promised a crackdown.\nBut Ms Battisson and other rights campaigners are questioning how a woman - who had told immigration authorities she was fleeing violence - could allegedly be snatched from her home in broad daylight.\nLolita first came to Melbourne in May 2022, according to flight records.\nAlthough she mostly kept to herself, she soon struck up a friendship with a Sudanese refugee who had also lived in Saudi Arabia, as an undocumented migrant.\nIt was Ali - not his real name - who put Lolita in touch with Ms Battisson, as she had helped him with his own asylum claim.\nThe human rights lawyer spoke frequently with Lolita from that point onwards, describing her as a \u201csoft spoken\u201d woman with a clear resolve to take back her life: \u201cShe was determined this was her time.\u201d\nBut their correspondence ended abruptly in May of last year, after Ms Battisson received a \u201cstrange\u201d text message from Lolita.\n\u201cIt was in much more formal language than she had ever used, and it said, \u2018What is my visa status\u2019,\u201d she tells the BBC.\nLolita's claim for a protection visa - for people at risk of persecution in their home country - had previously been rejected, but Ms Battisson was helping her appeal against the decision. She says that is something her client was acutely aware of, as the two discussed it frequently.\n\u201cI now believe that message was actually from the people who had taken Lolita,\u201d Ms Battisson says. She thinks they were trying to work out whether Lolita had a permanent visa, which would have given her the right to Australian consular assistance back in Saudi Arabia.\nThen came the radio silence. As the weeks turned to months, Ms Battisson knew in her gut that \u201csomething was seriously wrong\u201d.\nShe couldn't reach Ali either, which was highly unusual as the two kept in regular contact.\nWhen Ali eventually did return Ms Battisson\u2019s calls, her worst fears were confirmed.\nHe said that he had witnessed Lolita being taken, but that the incident had left him so paralysed with fear for his own family, that he\u2019d gone to ground.\nHe detailed his last conversation with Lolita - a frantic phone call in which she pleaded for protection from a group of men planning to take her to Saudi Arabia.\nShe even sent him pictures of the bags she claimed they had forced her to pack.\nAli told Ms Battisson he rushed to her flat, but on arrival an Arabic-speaking man threatened him, using personal details that Ali believes could only have come from the Saudi embassy in Canberra.\nChanging tack, he contacted a friend and asked him to go to the airport, so the two of them could \u201ccreate a fuss\u201d and get the attention of security.\nBut they never saw Lolita in the terminal.\n\u201cIt took me a year in total to confirm she had been taken,\u201d Ms Battisson says, the dismay in her voice palpable.\nThe pro-bono lawyer has since been building a paper trail to try to piece together what happened.\n\u201cWe have phone records and message records of her talking about being frightened. And we also have a pattern of her moving house because of that fear,\u201d she says.\nAnd then there\u2019s the recent testimony of a relative. \u201cAs far as they know, Lolita is now in a Saudi prison or detention centre,\u201d Ms Battisson says.\nGlaring gaps in the story remain, but one thing Ms Battisson is unequivocal about is that \u201cthere are simply no safe options\u201d for Lolita in her home country.\nSince becoming the de facto ruler of Saudi",

It is women taking children to the mosque in the holidays and who are out in public wearing face coverings.\"\nMs Blake added: \u201cWe need to empower women as their views, especially those in minority groups, are not heard enough.\n\u201cThey are seen as uneducated and little wallflowers who don\u2019t know what is best for them, but when you look at communities it is women who are leading them.\u201d\nLabour councillor Mary Lea, who represents Darnall, which has a large Muslim community, said some people had been left scared to leave their homes by recent events.\n\u201cA few people, particularly women, have said they are worried about going out and some families said they were worried about going into town,\" she explained.\n\u201cSomebody told me they had gone into Meadowhall last Sunday when there was the Rotherham riot and there were no Muslim women around, very few Asian shoppers, so maybe that was a sign of how worried people were.\u201d\nThe Dean of Sheffield Cathedral, the Very Rev Abigail Thompson, who also took part in the Unity in the Community event, said she had been \u201cdevastated and horrified\u201d by the riot at the Holiday Inn Express at Manvers, near Rotherham.\n\u201cWe really want to support people, especially the Muslim community, who are feeling so afraid,\" she said.\n\u201cWomen very quickly unite in these kinds of situations and give one another support, but women have been particularly affected.\"\nDean Thompson added: \"There have been horrendous stories of women having their hijabs ripped off and it shocked me to see fellow women being treated so disrespectfully.\n\u201cThe best way of beating this kind of hatred and fearfulness is to gather together like this and support one another.\n\u201cWhen I saw the scenes in Rotherham, I knew that wasn't representative of most people in this region. \n\"People are not like that. They are kind and very respectful of other faiths, so we have to get together and remind ourselves of that.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Helen Sims, chief executive of Voluntary Action Sheffield, said community groups had played a key part in passing on the latest information to people in the light of recent events.\nShe said: \u201cWe are there to make sure information is going out and is in the right language for people to understand. But, importantly, our role is working with community leaders to feed intelligence back.\n\u201cWe listen to what community leaders are seeing and hearing, the levels of anxiety and fear, and making sure that is fed back so we can reassure communities.\"\nMs Sims said social media in particular was \"causing a lot of worry\".\n\"We're trying to give reassurance and say, this may be on social media but there's no evidence to back it up,\" she said.\n\u201cThat reassurance is really important because social media is playing a really negative role. \n\"We need to relay positive information to counter some of that myths and rumours that are being whipped up on social media.\u201d\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "A group of 96 migrants were unlawfully detained at a Kent processing centre and subjected to ill-treatment by staff and humiliation, their lawyer has told the High Court.\nThe claims have been brought against the Home Office, which is yet to formally file a defence.\nAllegations included that migrants held at Manston between September and November 2022 did not have access to menstruation products, had severe bleeding in pregnancy and miscarriage and struggled to breastfeed.\nA Home Office spokesman said: \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment while there are ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d\nIt is understood that proceedings have been paused until October, amid efforts to reach settlements. \nAgata Patyna, representing the migrants, said in written arguments the group included unaccompanied children, women who were pregnant at the time of detention, vulnerable people with mental health conditions and disabilities and victims of trafficking, sexual offences and torture.\nShe said cases involved alleged \u201cbreaches of fundamental rights, including the right to liberty and prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment\u201d.\nAll 96 people made protection claims in the UK, with 54 recognised as refugees or given humanitarian protection, she said.\nThe court was told the migrants should be given anonymity \u201cto protect their legitimate interests, safety, privacy and welfare\u201d and in relation to the \u201chighly personal, distressing information\u201d allegedly linked to their treatment.\nAllegations were made over a child wearing soiled nappies.\nThey were also made over the humiliation of Muslim women by having to remove their hijabs in front of others and of a Muslim child having to eat non-Halal meat.\nOne child was left with an \u201congoing fear of going to the toilet on their own, without an adult present, in consequence of the trauma suffered while detained\u201d, the court heard.\nOn Friday, Judge John Dagnell concluded granting anonymity to the migrants was \u201cnecessary to secure proper administration of justice\u201d and to protect their interests.\nHe said: \u201cIt does seem to me that I should also bear in mind that, particularly in the light of recent events, there are sections of the populace who may be adversely inclined to asylum seekers.\u201d\nConcerns were raised about overcrowding at Manston in 2022.\nThe former military base is used to process arrivals of people who have entered the UK after crossing the English Channel by boat.\nIn November 2022, 4,000 people were at the site, which had a capacity of 1,600.\nOvercrowding with \u201cunacceptable conditions\u201d had also been flagged by inspectors a month earlier.\nThe Home Office previously said that improvements have since been made.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "A Thai court has dismissed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin for appointing to his cabinet a former lawyer who was once jailed. \nThe Constitutional Court ruled that Mr Srettha had violated the \"rules on ethics\" with \"the display of defiant behaviour\".  \nThe 62-year-old Srettha, who has been in power for less than a year, is the third PM in 16 years to be removed by the same court. \nHe will be replaced by an interim leader until Thailand's parliament convenes to elect a new prime minister. \n\u201cI\u2019m confident in my honesty \u2026 I feel sorry, but I\u2019m not saying I disagree with the ruling,\" he said at a press conference shortly after the ruling. The court's ruling is final and cannot be appealed.\nMr Srettha's dismissal means he has now gone the way of so many other parties and administrations in Thailand \u2013 felled by the disproportionate power of the country\u2019s constitutional court. \nPolitics in Thailand is not known for its ethics; bribery is commonplace and ministers with more serious convictions have been allowed to serve in the past. \nMost people in Thailand will see this as a political verdict, though exactly who was pushing for it is not yet clear. \nIn May the court had accepted a petition filed by some 40 senators asking to remove the PM from his position over his appointment of Pichit Chuenban - who was previously sentenced to six months in jail for attempted bribery.\nOn Wednesday, five of the nine judges ruled that Mr Srettha had indeed violated the ethics of his office by appointing a lawyer who had a criminal conviction to his cabinet, despite him quitting after just 19 days.\nThe vote for a new prime minister will involve plenty of backroom bargaining, while Thailand struggles to revive its faltering economy. \nHopes that the country was now putting the political turmoil, including two military coups that have shaken it for the past two decades, have proved premature. \nMr Srettha became prime minister only last August, ending nine years of military-dominated governments in Thailand.\nHis appointment too was the result of a political bargain that froze out the young, reformist Move Forward party, which had won the most seats and votes in last year's general election. \nIt was a stunning victory that raised hopes for a fresh start for Thailand but Move Forward was blocked from forming the government by the military-appointed senate. \nThe election's second-biggest winner Pheu Thai then struck a deal with other conservative parties to form a ruling coalition without Move Forward - and Mr Srettha found himself at the helm.\nLast week, the constitutional court dissolved the Move Forward party for making unconstitutional campaign promises and banned 11 party leaders  from politics for 10 years.\nAdditional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone in Bangkok",
    "US President Joe Biden has said he is not confident there will be a peaceful transition of power if Donald Trump loses the presidential election in November.\nIn his first interview since he dramatically dropped out of the race last month, Mr Biden told CBS News: \u201cIf Trump loses, I'm not confident at all.\"\n\"[Trump] means what he says, we don\u2019t take him seriously. He means it, all this stuff about \u2018if we lose it will be a bloodbath\u2019.\u201d\nMr Trump\u2019s comment that it would \u201cbe a bloodbath for the country\u201d if he loses the election, made as he was talking about the auto industry in March, triggered a wave of criticism.\nDemocrats were quick to reiterate their campaign message that the former president poses a threat to democracy. The Biden campaign used the \u201cbloodbath\u201d comment in an ad - posted on its social media accounts - and a spokesman accused Mr Trump of \u201cencouraging and excusing political violence\u201d.\nThe Trump campaign, however, said the comment was specifically about the auto industry and had been deliberately taken out of context. It sent a fundraising email which said Trump\u2019s political opponents and others had been \"viciously\" misquoting him.\n\"[They] fully understood that I was simply referring to imports allowed by Crooked Joe Biden, which are killing the automobile industry,\" Trump wrote on social media at the time.\nMr Biden has previously expressed concern that his former rival would not accept the result of the election.\nDuring the presidential debate on CNN in June - which triggered the crisis over Mr Biden's candidacy - Trump was asked directly whether he would accept the 2024 election results. \n\u201cIf it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election, absolutely,\" he responded, after initially avoiding the question.\nTrump made repeated unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020 after he lost that election to Mr Biden. \nHis supporters stormed the Capitol building in January 2021 in an effort to stop the election result from being certified. Many in attendance that day repeated the former president's claims that the vote had been rigged.\nIn the CBS interview clip released on Wednesday, which was posted on X, Mr Biden also appeared to suggest there were efforts to complicate the post-election certification processes, although it was unclear exactly what he was referring to.\n\u201cLook what they\u2019re trying to do now, in the local election districts where people count the votes,\u201d he said. \"You can't love your country only when you win.\"",
    "A teenager who abused officers and rocked a police van during rioting in Rotherham has become the first person to be jailed following the disorder.\nKenzie Roughley, 18, of Barnsley Road, Pontefract, was identified after his fingerprints were found on the CCTV van, which he kicked and tried to get into as a \u201cviolent mob\u201d attacked it, a court heard.\nSentencing him at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Jeremy Richardson KC said: \"The officer [in the van] was scared for his life and thought the vehicle would be turned over, which was clearly your aim.\"\nRoughley was sentenced to two years and four months in a young offenders\u2019 institution after pleading guilty to violent disorder.\nJudge Richardson told the defendant: \u201cYou were part of a violent mob of ignorant and violent individuals and you were playing your part to the full.\n\u201cYou have brought shame on yourself and the town in which you live. You must be punished for what you did.\u201d\nRoughley was said to have gone to the gathering at the Holiday Inn Express in Manvers on Sunday with his father.\nPolice body-worn video played to the court showed him verbally abusing the officers, saying he hoped they would be \"hit in the head with a brick\u201d, the prosecution said.\nChildren were seen on the video which Judge Richardson said would have been \u201ctruly frightening\u201d.\nNone of Roughley\u2019s family were in court for his sentencing and the judge remarked he had had a \u201cdeplorable upbringing\u201d.\n\u201cI expect if the father attended [court] he\u2019d be arrested,\" Judge Richardson said, referring to him possibly being seen on the video also abusing officers outside the hotel.\nRoughley was arrested on Wednesday, pleaded guilty to violent disorder on Thursday at a hearing at the magistrates\u2019 court, and jailed on Friday as part of fast- tracked justice following the nationwide disorder.\nDespite turning 18 just a week ago, he committed the act while on police bail for a previous offence, the court heard.\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "The largest cybersecurity company in the US has apologised for using two women posing with company-branded lampshades on their heads at a trade event in Las Vegas.\nThey were meant to draw attention to Palo Alto Networks' sponsorship of a \"CyberRisk Collaborative Happy Hour\" at the Black Hat conference.\nBut the publicity stunt has sparked a backlash, with critics calling it \"sexist\", \"creepy\" and \"tone deaf\".\nIn a LinkedIn post, the firm\u2019s boss Nikesh Arora admitted it was a misjudgement, saying it was \"unequivocally not the culture we support, or aspire to be\".\nThe company has faced fierce criticism online for the lampshade outfits, which obscured the women\u2019s faces.\n\"So we women are nothing more than props to you? We are only at BlackHat to be lampshade holders?\" asked executive advisor Olivia Rose in a LinkedIn post that eventually prompted Mr Arora\u2019s apology.\n\"Shame on you - just shame\", she wrote.\nThe image of the women was taken by LinkedIn user Sean Juroviesky who described the scene as \"sexist\".\n\"What the hell Palo Alto Networks is it 1960?\", he commented.\nOne Reddit user, who claimed to have been at the event, said they left early as it was \"creepy\" and \"gross\".\nThe idea for the outfits seems to have been inspired by the so-called \"booth babes\" of the early days of the Consumer Electronics Show, in the 1960s, where women were hired as hostesses at what were mostly male-attended events.\nBy the 1990s the use of what were often scantily-clad women in this way started facing a backlash, and by the 2010s it had largely disappeared.\nBut the male dominance of the tech industry has not gone away - nor have concerns that women are being shut out or treated in sexist ways.\nWhen it shut unexpectedly earlier this year, the tech network Women Who Code said its vision of a tech industry \"where diverse women and historically excluded people thrive at every level is not fulfilled\".\nOne of the few female tech CEO\u2019s Bumble\u2019s Lidiane Jones told the BBC this year it was \"still not an equitable journey for women today\" in the industry.",
    "Two men who conned close friends and family out of almost \u00a39m in life savings and pensions have been jailed.\nAndrew Bird, 60, and Christopher Walton, 67, carried out the fraud over six years \u2013 taking huge sums from people who they duped into investing money, which was used to pay back other investors to keep their scam running.\nThey had denied fraud, but were convicted earlier this year and jailed for eight years and five years respectively on Thursday.\nAt Nottingham Crown Court, Judge Michael Auty KC said their scam had a \"devastating impact\" on its victims.\nBird and Walton ran a company called Anglo American Equities (AAE), which claimed to invest people's money in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\nThat is a genuine market where people can buy or sell precious metals, foreign currencies, treasury bonds, cryptocurrencies and financial contracts.\nYet both men were actually running a so-called Ponzi scheme, in which money from new investors was used to pay fake dividends to existing participants.\nDerbyshire Police began investigating AAE after receiving a number of complaints from people, who said they had been unable to cash in their investment.\nDetectives said they soon established there had been wrongdoing.\nBoth men denied 13 charges of fraud by false representation, but had admitted carrying out a regulated activity whilst not authorised.\nFollowing a nine-week trial, Bird was convicted on all of the counts of fraud, and Walton on 10, but he was acquitted of three.\nThe case against them centred on the period between 2010 and 2016.\nDet Sgt Richard Foster said: \"We have got a lot of victims who have lost a lot of money - their life savings, their pensions.\n\"They were all friends, family, close relations, where they trusted Bird and Walton to invest their money.\n\"It's had a profound impact on them - some have not been able to recover financially - they've had to go back into work, or simply can't retire.\"\nPolice say it was a classic Ponzi scam - named after the fraudster Charles Ponzi - in which investors are offered high returns.\nYet in reality, very little of the money was invested. \nPolice said the pair met at Horsley Lodge Golf Club in Derbyshire in 2005 when Bird, of Church Road, Quarndon, Derbyshire, was running the AAE company. \nWalton, a former bank manager from Church Street, Kilburn, Derbyshire, had heard of Bird's reported success in trading and investment and the two then joined forces, police added.\nThey convinced friends and family, many of whom were elderly and vulnerable, of the returns they could expect and lied to them about the risk the investments could see - \"playing on the fact that Bird had never lost money trading\".\nOnce investors had paid money, they received documents designed to persuade them that their investment was doing well and encourage them to invest further. \nHowever, the documentation was falsified and the majority of the money that Bird and Walton took from people was not used to trade at all.\nThe scheme collapsed in August 2016 after running out of new cash, police said.\nBird is said to have traded on his name - and his family's past connections with the Derby-based Birds Bakery business.\nDet Sgt Foster said: \"Andrew Bird has nothing to do with Birds Bakery, but we have got evidence from some victims that he relied on the reputation of the name to give some credibility, if something had gone wrong, there were some funds they could recoup.\n\"They were simply deceived. This isn't a cold-calling investment scheme, this is where trust and reliability have been exploited to fund this scheme and keep it going so long, so it's had a devastating impact on its victims.\"\nA spokesperson for Birds Bakery added: \"We would like to reiterate the words of Derbyshire Police, that Andrew Bird has no involvement with our business or its running. \n\"We were saddened and shocked to hear that the longstanding and trusted reputation of Birds Bakery has been exploited in such a way.\"\nAs part of a string of victim impact statements, one said he lost \u00a340,000 after trusting Walton as a family friend.\nAnother said: \"I will always remember the day I was on holiday and received the email from Walton to say all the money was lost.\"\nA further victim, who had invested \u00a3100,000, said that money was his \"life savings for a sustainable retirement - they [Bird and Walton] ruined our lives\".\nJudge Michael Auty KC, sentencing the pair, said: \"You both obtained investors' money and in literal terms, it never really went anywhere.\"\nHe said Bird was \"deluded\" about his skill as a financial trader and that had \"tragic and enduring consequences for many hard-working, decent people\".\n\"This had a devastating impact - there will be devastation and lifelong misery of so many people.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "There is too much confusion surrounding the newly introduced XL bully legislation resulting in \"good dogs dying\", an animal charity owner has said.\nIt is now against the law to sell, give away, abandon or breed from an XL bully in England and Wales and since February it has been a criminal offence to own an XL bully without an exemption certificate.\nSteven Wakelin, who runs Wolfwood Wildlife and Dog Rescue in Lancaster, has plenty of experience working with dogs and said there was a big grey area when it came to the rules.\nHe said the new legislation stated dogs with a \"substantial number of XL bully characteristics\" were banned.\nHe said police had refused to help them with guidance and the charity was \"clogged up\" with much-loved dogs \"in limbo\" as they did not know if they were able to rehome them.\nAn XL bully is the largest kind of American bully dog and there have been a number of attacks involving the dogs, some fatal.\nThe government has published guidance to help identify XL bullies which were not recognised as a specific breed.\nMr Wakelin added the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said if dogs had 60% characteristics of an XL then it cannot go anywhere.\n\"Some of the dogs we know we are not going to place and that is causing a lot of stress for those people involved,\" he said.\n\"Good dogs are dying and all we really need is someone to come in and say clearly this is a dog that can go to a new home [or] this is a dog that cannot go to a new home.\n\"We are persecuting all large bull dogs that aren't in the UK Kennel Club registration so all cross-breeds are caught up in it,\" he said.\nHe added police had \"refused blankly to help us\".\n\"This law was rushed in there was no infrastructure put in place, there was no funding put in for the police to implement this, so I understand it, but we are six months down the line and we are still sat here not knowing what the heck we are supposed to do with these dogs.\"\nHe said it was leaving the charity \"facing tough decisions\" on the future of the animals. \n\"The charity isn't able to function as it should because we are clogged up with these dogs in limbo,\" he said.\nMr Wakelin added it was also preventing the charity from taking in some dogs \"because we don't know if we are allowed to receive them or not\".\nThe RSPCA said it had highlighted these issues with Defra since the ban was announced last year and were calling for an urgent review of the legislation.\nDog welfare expert Dr Samantha Gaines said: \"While we're desperate to give [all dogs we take in] the chance to find loving new homes, this legislation means that should they conform with the description of an XL Bully we can't rehome them with a member of the public and we have no choice but to put them to sleep.\"\nShe said due to the speed with which the legislation was introduced, and the number of dogs affected by it, dog legislation officers were unable to come out to rescue centres to formally assess and identify those dogs so the RSPCA have had to bring in independent experts to assess all suspected dogs.\n\"While police are caught up enforcing this ban, there is even less resource to manage dogs - irrespective of their type or breed - who pose a genuine risk to public safety,\" she said.\nA Defra spokesperson said: \"The ban on XL bullies is an important measure to protect public safety, and we expect all XL bully owners to comply with the strict conditions. \n\"We continue to work with the police, local authorities and animal welfare groups to prevent dog attacks by encouraging responsible dog ownership across all breeds of dog.\"\nThe National Police Chief Council has been contacted for comment.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds\u00a0and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A Scottish horror film has finally been released - 17 years after filming first got under way.\nThe Bench is a grisly slasher where a group of friends take a trip to a remote cabin in Renfrewshire, only to disappear one by one.\nHowever, the production was struck by a host of difficulties, from badly misjudging the Scottish weather's suitability for filming to money running out half way through.\nWriter and director Sean Wilkie told BBC Scotland News that he was a mixture of being \"pleased, nervous and relieved\" now that The Bench can be seen by the public.   \nThe Coatbridge native had worked on short films before deciding to tackle a full-length horror.\nHe was inspired by some of his favourites from the genre such as Halloween, The Hills Have Eyes and Tobe Hooper's dread-inducing tale of unwitting teenagers encountering a cannibal family, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\nFilming began in Lochwinnoch in 2007, using a cabin owned by friends of the film's director of photography.\nFor indoor filming, the Caves venue in Edinburgh was used, with Drumpellier Country Park used for occasional outdoor shots.\nThe film has a cast that includes Two Doors Down star Joy McAvoy and Matt McClure from American horror show Penny Dreadful.\n\"The first two weeks on location were fine but we couldn\u2019t keep that up,\" reflects Sean.\n\"I wish we\u2019d have someone following us all the way though, as it would have made some documentary. Due to the weather and other things we couldn\u2019t finish filming as planned, so we were coming back on odd weekends here and there to complete it.\"\nThat was only the start of the film's issues. Initial financing had fallen through at an early stage, but Sean decided to \"charge ahead\" anyway, something he admits now was \"probably a mistake.\"\nThe film's original editor departed, so Sean took on that role as well, and by the time reshoots were needed many of the cast and crew were working on other projects.\n\"I had to gather the footage together and do the editing, and then I realised what we were missing\", he says.\n\"So I was having to get some of the cast to fly back when they could [for reshoots] and drag them back to the cabin in Lochwinnoch. Then we\u2019d go and there would be a blizzard, so we had to abandon filming anyway and try again later.\n\"I was probably quite na\u00efve. I\u2019d watched a lot of American horror films when I was writing the script, like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre where it\u2019s set in these roasting locations - completely forgetting that we would be filming in Scotland and that warm temperatures were not going to happen.\"\nThat process also created continuity issues, as Sean tried to juggle cast members having changed their hairstyles between their original scenes and the added filming.   \nWith money having run out by the time filming was finally completed in about 2011, Sean then had to rely on favours for post-production and scoring the film. That meant those factors took even more years to complete.\nIt was only around 2016 that The Bench was mostly complete.\n\"By the time that was all finished, I had no energy left at all, so it just sat in a drawer,\" says Sean, who now teaches animation and filmmaking, as well as working on scripts as a freelance writer.\n\"It took a lot out of a lot of friendships and I was paying off money to do with it for a while, so I wanted nothing to do with it.\"\nHowever, like any self-respecting slasher villain, the film rose up from the dead. \nAn approach by Ryan Hendrick - the director of Scottish set festive romance Lost At Christmas - led to the film being dusted down.\n\"He said he thought it could do quite well for a small distribution company he\u2019d set up,\" Sean says. \"There were a few problems with continuity due to actors having different hair between the first shooting and the reshoots, but he\u2019s cut around that cleverly, and I was really impressed by the work he\u2019s done.\"\nNow The Bench is streaming on Amazon Prime, and Sean feels it has sparked a desire to get back behind the camera.\n\"I\u2019ve started to get ideas again,\" he laughs. \n\"I\u2019ve mostly been writing, but we showed it at Cineworld recently and the audience seemed to really like it.

At first she thought his body was \"sacks laid on the ground\".\nGiving evidence, she said she had seen the headlights of the Range Rover and assumed he was watching a fox outside as he sometimes did.\nShe decided to go outside and investigate at 21:47 BST and found the engine running and two doors open, including the driver's door.\nDiscovering Mr Thirsk lying on his right side on the ground and not moving, Ms Thirsk began CPR.\nShe was on the phone to her brother James Clegg as she discovered Mr Thirsk, and he called the emergency services.\nDespite the best efforts of Mrs Thirsk and the air ambulance, Mr Thirsk was pronounced dead at 22:45.\nRoger Hughes, vehicle investigation worker for Jaguar Land Rover, told the court that if a Range Rover is in drive or reverse and the electronic park brake is not applied it can \"creep forward\" on its own.\nAlexander Holmes, forensic collision investigator at West Yorkshire Police, said a pair of tyre marks found at the scene showed the vehicle had \"rolled to a stop\".\nHumberside Police initially treated the incident as \"unexpected\", but, following an investigation, the force concluded there was no third-party involvement in Mr Thirsk's death.\nInvestigators found scuff marks on the heel of Mr Thirsk's left shoe which were \"consistent with being dragged backwards\".\nBy undertaking tests following the incident, Det Sgt Sam Cunningham from Humberside Police found the Range Rover would have been travelling at a maximum speed of 7mph and it would have \"gone over someone quite easily\".\nForensic pathologist Dr Christopher Johnson told the court Mr Thirsk would have died \"almost instantly\" from his injuries which included \"massive internal bleeding\" and were similar to those someone would sustain after \"being run over\".\nA toxicology report confirmed there was no alcohol in Mr Thirsk\u2019s blood at the time of his death.\nMr Thirsk\u2019s son, Harry Thirsk, told the court his father had suffered two strokes and was \"not the best\" with machinery before his stroke, and \"more unreliable\" afterwards.\nSteve Baxter, manager at H S Thirsk Farms since 2016, described Mr Thirsk as a \"good driver\", but said there was an incident Mr Thirsk had reported to him which took place in November 2021.\nMr Baxter told the court Mr Thirsk had taken one of his Rolls Royce vehicles on a shooting trip.\nHe said: \"He thought he\u2019d put the car into park, but as he was going to get out he realised he had put it into reverse. He accidentally hit the throttle instead of the brake.\"\nMr Thirsk was born in 1947 in Pocklington. His business assets included several farms and related properties in the Pocklington area, as well as The Feathers Hotel and the Stamford Bar and Grill.\nHe often drove around the area and stopped to see wildlife.\n\"This is nothing other than a tragic accident. Nobody is to blame. He was a well-loved gentleman in the neighbourhood and beyond,\" Mr Marks concluded.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "Chinese authorities have called for gig workers to be treated with kindness after videos of a delivery rider kneeling before a security guard led to protests by dozens of riders.\nGuards stopped the rider from leaving a building in Hangzhou on Monday - saying he damaged railings while scaling them during a rushed delivery.\nWorried that his subsequent deliveries would be delayed, the rider got on his knees and pleaded to be let go, the city's police said in a statement.\nThe incident sparked outrage online, with many urging better protections for workers in the industry.\nSome 12 million people work as delivery riders in China, and the pandemic has fuelled explosive growth in the sector.  \nBut the industry - much like in the rest of the world - is notorious for its tight deadlines, where low-wage riders are subject to tough penalties over delays and poor customer feedback. \nMany also work long days, earning less than a dollar for each delivery.\nThe incident on Monday drew huge crowds of angry delivery riders to the building  in downtown Hangzhou, leading the police to dispatch dozen of officers to manage the situation - including from the special weapons and tactics team.\nVideos shared on social media show the riders chanting, \"Apologise! Apologise!\" \nAt one point, they start belting out China's national anthem.\nHangzhou police issued a statement on Tuesday urging the public to \"stay calm and seek to understand one another\".\nMeituan, the delivery platform that the rider in question was working for, said it will \"take thorough responsibility\" to look into whether he was treated unfairly, and ensure its delivery riders are properly protected. \nThe platform added that it has paid to repair the broken railings.\nHashtags related to the incident have clocked up hundreds of millions of views on microblogging platform Weibo in the last few days.\nSome users condemned the security guards' \"bullying tactics\", while others acknowledged that the rider had made a mistake.\n\"They are both low-wage workers. Why did it have to come to this?\" one user wrote. \"It's a hot day, it's not easy for all of us. Let's try to empathise with one another.\" \nOthers cited poor working conditions as a factor.\n\"Why do delivery riders break traffic rules so often? It's simple. They will be fined if their deliveries are delayed,\" another user wrote. \n\"This is the power of the platforms they work for. And so the riders work as hard as they can and risk their lives in order to complete what they have to do. \n\"It's exactly how sweatshops function.\"\nChina has over the years introduced guidelines to protect the rights and interests of gig workers, but problems remain. \nIncidents of riders clashing with security guards in China have made headlines in the past. \nIn January this year, a delivery rider in the eastern city of Qingdao was stabbed to death by a security guard for entering a building without authorisation.\nResearch by the China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based NGO, shows gig workers have held at least 400 protests in the last five years to demand improvements.",
    "The shadow Welsh secretary has apologised after suggesting the escalating violence across parts of England is \"politically justified\". \nLord Byron Davies of Gower issued an apology insisting he \"utterly condemns\" the violence but stands by his criticism of Labour's \"totally negative\" approach to immigration and organised crime.  \nThe comments were made in response to a social media post by journalist Dan Hodges, who condemned the attacks as having \"no political justification\" and any blame on the Labour party to be \"ridiculous\". \nLord Davies has since been reprimanded by his chief whip and reminded of the consequences of language misuse, according to the Conservatives. \nLord Davies initially stood by his comment, which stated the attacks were politically justified because \"Labour blocked the Rwanda Bill 130+ times\", but has since aimed his frustration solely at the Labour party. \nThe Rwanda Bill is the Conservatives' plan to send migrants to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed. \nThe comments follow outbreaks of violent disorder in parts of England since the killings of three girls in Southport on Monday. \nCardiff born Axel Rudakubana, 17, is accused of the attack but false rumours spread online of the killer being an asylum seeker who travelled to the UK via boat. \nThere have been riots in several cities including Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Blackpool, and Belfast. \nPosting to X, formerly known as Twitter, Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said Lord Davies's comments were \"disgusting, misguided and dangerous\". \n\"Racist violence is never justified,\" she said.\n\"Politicians, including unelected ones, have an important responsibility to de-escalate tensions. Those inflaming them should seriously consider their position.\"\nWelsh Office minister Nia Griffith said she was \"horrified\" by what she felt was justification of the violence, adding she was \"very pleased to hear that he has apologised\".\nConservative leader Rishi Sunak condemned the \"violent, criminal behaviour\" around the country on X on Sunday, saying that the scenes unfolding had \"nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport\".\n\"This is violent, criminal behaviour that has no place in our society,\" he said.\n\"The police have our full support to deal with these criminals swiftly and they must face the full weight of the law.\"\nA Conservative spokesperson told Nation Cymru that Lord Davies's comments were \"unacceptable\" and is being spoken to by the Lords opposition chief whip.

    "The first wild red-billed chough chick to be born in Kent for more than 200 years has not been seen for a month after going missing in strong winds.\nWild red-billed choughs had not been spotted in the county for two centuries, which Kent Wildlife Trust says is because of habitat loss and historic persecution.\nA 40-year project by the trust to restore chalk grassland and create a suitable habitat around Dover Castle allowed several of the birds to be introduced into the area last year.\nA young pair among those released successfully bred this summer, with the first chick fledging in June. However, said the chick has disappeared.\nThe trust said: \"As of summer 2024, there are clear signs that the once-extinct red-billed chough will thrive again in the South East. \n\"Less than a year on from their release, and following the emergence of a breeding pair, the first wild chick for generations was hatched at Dover Castle. \n\"The chick fledged successfully in June, but unfortunately went missing during strong winds and hasn\u2019t been seen since early July. \n\"Still, the birth is a milestone we didn\u2019t expect to hit so early by any means.\"\nPaul Hadaway, director of conservation and engagement at Kent Wildlife Trust, said: \u201cThe red-billed chough reintroduction project in Dover demonstrates that - even with the perilous state of nature and wildlife in this country - it is still possible to restore nature and return missing species.\n\u201cWe have laid the foundations for a successful release program that will see this flagship bird re-established in a county with which it has a long cultural association.\u201d\nThe trust remains hopefully of further chicks, saying it did not expect to see one so early into the habitat project.\nThe project aims to have 15 pairs breeding in the wild in a decade.\nAccording to Kentish legend, the chough got its bright red beak and legs by wading in the blood of Thomas Becket, the archbishop murdered in Canterbury cathedral by four knights.\nThe bird is featured in the Canterbury coat of arms.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X and on Instagram.

    "\u201cIf you remember being a kid and blowing up a balloon or into a milkshake, your cheeks got sore because there is an energy penalty associated with bubble formation.\u201d\nPaul Barrett, the Dublin-born chief executive of the Australian green energy firm Hysata, is explaining the plan to create the cheapest hydrogen in the world - by eliminating bubbles.\nThe company, based at Port Kembla, an industrial hub south of Sydney, is using a familiar process known as electrolysis, which involves passing electricity through water to split it into hydrogen and oxygen.\nBut Hysata has developed a special material which sits in the water and which it says makes its electrolyser much more efficient than competing products.\nThe company says it can produce a kilo of hydrogen using 20% less electricity than conventional methods.\nHydrogen is the most abundant element on the planet and, crucially, when used as a fuel or in industrial processes it does not produce carbon dioxide (CO2).\nMany see hydrogen as the answer to cutting carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industry like steelmaking and chemical production.\nHydrogen production comes in four varieties - green, grey, blue and black.\nThe green variety is produced with renewable energy, grey comes from splitting methane into carbon dioxide and hydrogen, while blue is made in the same way, but the CO2 by-product is captured and stored.\nThe production of black hydrogen comes from partially burning coal.\nBut if there is to be a transition to green hydrogen then its supply needs to be massively increased.\n\u201cEnsuring you have the production of green hydrogen close enough to the demand point and being able to regulate the supply of that is probably the biggest challenge,\u201d explains Dr Liam Wagner, an associate professor at Perth's Curtin University.\n\u201cThe efficiency of production and the amount of energy required to run these processes is the biggest frontier.\u201d\nAustralia is rich in natural resources and has long been the world\u2019s quarry. It\u2019s an export-driven nation; its coal has helped to power Japan, while its iron ore has underpinned much of China\u2019s growth. Many hope that hydrogen could follow.\n\u201cThe prospects for hydrogen are as a way of exporting energy to countries that can\u2019t produce enough of their own either as hydrogen in a liquid form or as ammonia, which I think is the most likely,\u201d Dr Wagner adds.\nHysata hopes to play a part in that. Its device was initially invented by researchers at the University of Wollongong in the state of New South Wales.\nIn a conventional electrolyser, bubbles in the water can be clingy and stick to the electrodes, clogging up the process and leading to energy loss.\nBy using a sponge-like material between the electrodes, Hysata eliminates those troublesome bubbles.\n\u201cIt is not unlike your kitchen sponge in terms of what it does. It is just a lot thinner,\u201d says Mr Barrett.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to manufacture at a super low cost,\u201d he adds. \nCost and efficiency have been major hurdles for the hydrogen sector, but Hysata has recently raised US$111m (\u00a387m) in investment to beef up its production.\n\u201cWhat we are speaking about is natural hydrogen which is coming directly from the earth,\u201d explains Dr Ema Frery, a research team leader at CSIRO, Australia\u2019s national science agency.\n\u201cA lot of rocks that are in Australia can produce hydrogen. We have a lot of old granites that are now close to the subsurface and can generate hydrogen through radiogenic processes.\u201d\nSo-called geogenic hydrogen is also known as white or gold hydrogen.\nDr Frery, a French-born geoscientist based in Western Australia, is investigating how it might be extracted, stored and used in an economically viable way.\n\u201cA conventional hydrogen system can consist of a rock capable of generating hydrogen at a given rate, migration pathways and a reservoir where the hydrogen can be stored.\n\u201cSurface seeps at the top of the reservoir can indicate the presence of a hydrogen system at depth,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is happening in other countries. In Mali, people are extracting natural hydrogen from the ground for more than ten years to produce electricity for a local village.\u201d\nDespite the research work, some doubt that hydrogen will become a big export for Australia.\nOne of those is the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a global research organisation which advocates the use of renewable energy.\nExporting hydrogen from Australia would \u201cmake no financial sense\u201d, according to Amandine Denis-Ryan, the chief executive of the IEEFA in Australia.\n\u201cHydrogen shipping would be prohibitively expensive. It requires extremely low temperatures and large volumes, and involves high losses. Using hydrogen locally makes much more sense.\u201d\nShe hopes that government funding will not be \u201cwasted\u201d on such projects.\nLike bubbles on electrodes, new technologies and processes invariably hit sticky patches where progress is hindered and doubts amplified, but the architects of hydrogen\u2019s advance are confident ",
    "Thirteen-year-old Finn and his mum Kerry-Anne have just completed the adventure of a lifetime, walking almost 1,200 miles around the perimeter of Wales.\nThe pair spent 84 days carrying everything they needed to camp on their backs, sometimes in driving rain, before sleeping in a tent together each night - conditions that could test any relationship.\n\"It was intense - in a good way,\" laughed Kerry-Anne.\n\"It's a different level of connection, Finn couldn't go off and slam a door and go to his room, I couldn't walk away.\"\nFinn's \"emotionally passionate\" nature could at times be challenging, she said.\n\"If you don't mind me saying,\" Kerry-Anne checked in with Finn.\n\"Not at all,\" he replied.\n\"We have arguments but you have to work hard to get over it,\" Kerry-Anne added.\nThe pair are now back home in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, where they share a home with Finn's dad and Kerry-Anne's husband John.\nKerry-Anne grew up in Llanmaes, Vale of Glamorgan, so the trip was an opportunity for her to revisit places from her childhood. \nThe mother and son are used to spending lots of time together, as Finn is home-schooled, with exploring nature a big part of his education.\n\"When he was young he was very unsettled,\" said Kerry-Anne, 45.\n\"We've not had any diagnosis, but we think probably neurodivergent - you identify with that?\" she asked Finn.\nHe nodded in agreement.\nShe continued: \"I noticed that getting outside was beneficial for him as much as it was for me... so I just wanted to make sure he was outside as much as he was in.\"\nWhen Finn was born Kerry-Anne decided to take a break from her career in academia and youth work.\nThen when the time came to put his name down for a school place she felt he was not ready.\nAfter lots of reading on the subject and discussions with her husband, a television floor manager, they decided on home-schooling.\n\"It just worked for us,\" she said.\n\"It has always been year by year and if Finn ever wanted to go to school - which he doesn't - it would be his decision.\"\nThe Wales walk was by no means the pair's first adventure.\nSince Finn was small they would go outside every day to observe the slow changing of the seasons and often picnic along or swim in the River Clyde near their home.\n\"It wasn't always idyllic,\" said Kerry-Anne.\n\"Sometimes one of us would be in a bad mood or not want to go. It is beautiful looking back on it, but anything with children is quite challenging at the time.\"\nThen when Finn was five, inspired by Alastair Humphreys' book Microadventures, they attempted to sleep out under the stars in just a bivvy bag for one night of each month of the year.\nIn January, they slept in the snow in their back garden, in the summer they would sleep in the forest or on beaches.\nThey took on their first thru-hiking challenge when Finn was 10, spending four days walking the Isle of Arran Coastal Way before they had to head home when the wind snapped the poles of their tent.\nThen last year when Finn was 12, they really upped the ante, completing the UK's longest national trail, the 630-mile (1,013km) South West Coast Path.\n\"Now that was challenging,\" recalled Finn.\n\"I didn't realise what I was signing up for,\" he joked. \nBut despite the extreme distance, he said he and his mum got on \"quite well\".\n\"There were a few challenging moments,\" said Kerry-Anne.\n\"Finn can make up a story that's five hours long and lasts the entire day.\"\n\"It's true, it\u2019s true,\" confirmed Finn.\n\"I struggle with that lack of mental space,\" admitted Kerry-Anne.\nAt night they settled into a routine where Finn was responsible for getting water and the washing-up but apart from that, could read.\nKerry-Anne's evenings were spent putting the tent up, organising dinner, showering, washing her underwear \"because I only took a couple of pairs\" and researching the next day's food stops and campsite before they both went to bed at 21:00.\nEach missed different things from their home life.\n\"I was missing board games a great deal - we [he and his friends] like to play really, really complicated ones,\" said Finn.\nHe said he also missed tofu which they found hard to come by.\nKerry-Anne missed fruit and vegetables.\n\"We ate so much junk food, it was all convenience stores and we were eating mostly snack bars and things,\" she said.\nDespite these challenges, they decided to take on the Wales walk while still walking the South West Coast Path.\nA year after their first epic walk, Kerry-Anne and Finn set off again in April.\nThey began with the 870-mile (1,400km) Wales Coast Path, which covers the entire country's coastline, followed by the 177-mile (285km) Offa's Dyke Path along the Wales-England border.\nFinn admitted he spent much of the time singing \"I would walk 500 miles\" from the Proclaimers song I'm Gonna Be (500 miles).\nOfficially the route was 1,050 miles but they did closer to 1,180 because of detours to campsites and shops.\nFinn's Wales highlights included \"getting to eat Cypriot halloumi and chips\" in New Quay, Ceredigion, and \"one o",
    "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has said some of its internal communications have been hacked and suggested it was targeted by Iranian operatives.\nUS news website Politico reported on Saturday that it had been emailed campaign documents including internal research carried out on Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance.\nA Trump campaign spokesman told the BBC the documents were illegally obtained by \"foreign sources hostile to the United States\". In a statement to US media, Iranian officials denied any connection to the hack.\nPolitico said it had confirmed the authenticity of the documents. The BBC has not independently verified the claims.\nThe Trump campaign did not give any further details or any evidence linking the document leak to Iranian hackers or the Iranian government.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Monday that it is investigating the incident. \nThe Trump campaign statement came one day after Microsoft released a report indicating that Iranian hackers targeted the campaign of an unnamed US presidential candidate in June.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) said that the campaign was sent a spear phishing email \u2013 a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link.\n\u201cOver the past several months, we have seen the emergence of significant influence activity by Iranian actors,\u201d the MTAC report said.\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said the June hacking attempt mentioned in the MTAC report \u201ccoincides with the close timing of President Trump\u2019s selection of a vice presidential nominee\".\n\u201cThe Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\u201d Mr Cheung said.\nHe said the hack was \"intended to interfere with the 2024 election\".\nA spokesman for Iran\u2019s permanent mission to the United Nations said in a statement to the Washington Post: \u201cWe do not accord any credence to such reports. \n\"The Iranian Government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.\"\nPolitico said that in late July it began receiving emails from a person who identified themselves only as \u201cRobert\u201d using an AOL email account.\nThe news outlet said the Vance file was 271 pages long and based on publicly available information about Vance\u2019s past record and statements. The email account also sent part of a research document about Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was also a vice presidential contender, it said.\nPresidential campaigns routinely research potential vice-presidential nominees in order to ferret out any potentially embarrassing revelations. Politico reported that some of Mr Vance's previous - and well-known - criticisms of Trump were labelled in the document as \"potential vulnerabilities\". \nThe Microsoft report noted: \"Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three US election cycles.\"\nMicrosoft had released a similar report during the 2020 election saying Iranian hackers had targeted presidential campaigns. \nUS security sources have also warned of an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump, unconnected to last month\u2019s attempted shooting in Pennsylvania. And on Tuesday, the US justice department charged a Pakistani man alleged to have ties to Iran with plotting to assassinate US officials, potentially including the former president.\n",

    "Work to repair a landmark bridge in Grimsby is not expected to be completed until next summer, according to the local council.\nThe Grade II-listed Corporation Road Bridge has been closed to vehicles since February 2023.\nThe bridge, which opened in 1925, spans the River Freshney and is a main route into Grimsby town centre.\nThe \u00a35m restoration had been expected to last about a year, but was put back after the structure was found to be in a worse-than-expected state.\n\nAccording to a survey report, significant repairs and restoration work have already been carried out, including shot-blasting the structure to remove decades of paint, rust and grime.\nHowever, officials said the work had uncovered \"significant areas of rusting and corrosion\".\n\nCouncillor Stewart Swinburn, portfolio holder for housing, infrastructure and transport at North East Lincolnshire Council, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no denying that this has been a complex project with numerous challenges. \n\"We\u2019ve had to navigate some significant issues to try to get this bridge back to how it would have looked almost 100 years ago.\n\u201cWe\u2019re also clear that we\u2019re not there yet. There is still work to be done and I know that this is not ideal.\"\nMr Swinburn said he understood people's frustrations, adding: \u201cI want to reassure them that we are working as quickly as possible to get this project over the line.\u201d\n\nReacting to the news, Tina Smith told BBC Radio Humberside it was \u201ca bit awkward\u201d as the bridge was used by a lot of traffic.\nShe said people also faced a long walk round at times when the bridge was closed off to pedestrians.\nMeanwhile, Sarah Carr described it as \u201cabsolute madness\u201d. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame it\u2019s taken them so long,\u201d she said.\nShe said there was also a lack of signage to inform people when the footpath was closed.\n\u201cYou walk all the way down the path, only to have to go back and walk all the way round,\u201d she added.\n\u201cI think someone needs a kick up the bum.\"\nMichael Stylianou, who runs a self-drive hire business nearby, said the closure had led to some \"logistical\" issues, including sending vehicles for repair.\nHowever, he said the closure had impacted more on small businesses who relied on passing trade.\n\"It\u2019s a bit of a detour and it takes people on a different route,\" he said.\n\"It\u2019s gone on far too long.\" \nThe authority said lessons had been learned for future schemes, but said many of the challenges could not have been foreseen.\nHowever, it said the project could have benefited from clearer communication at the start about how the duration of the works could extend if additional defects were identified.\nDue to the extensive additional work required to replace parts of the steel structure, costs had also increased, it added.\nThe authority said it was unable to say by how much as the information was \"commercially sensitive at this stage\".\nThe authority is expected to publish a further update in the autumn.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "New figures released by an animal welfare charity have revealed a sharp increase in animal cruelty cases across the West. \nLast year, the RSPCA received a report of animal cruelty\u00a0every five minutes during its busiest summer months\u00a0- but its officers said \"the worst could be yet to come\". \nThe charity said reports of animal abuse in Bristol were up by 11.27% this year, with Wiltshire and Somerset also seeing an increase of 13.7% and 10.3% respectively. \nIn response to this seasonal peak in cruelty, the organisation has now launched its\u00a0\u2018No Animal Deserves Cruelty\u2019\u00a0summer appeal to raise money.\nLast summer, reports of intentional harm towards animals rose by 11% compared with the previous year, with animal beating reports also rising sharply - by 17%.\nThe RSPCA's appeal aimed to raise money to rescue animals from harm and give them the lives they deserved \u2013 \"free from terror and torment\". \nAccording to the charity, more than 80% of any donation would go towards rescuing, rehoming and caring for abandoned pets, neglected animals and vulnerable wildlife.\nKaren Colman, who heads up the RSPCA welfare oversight team, said: \"Rescuing animals from cruelty, investigating harm caused to them, and acting to prevent animal abuse, is a job no other charity does.\n\"We\u2019ll always be here to pick up the pieces and show those animals the kindness and care they deserve.\u201d\nMs Coleman said this year, there have been 316 reports of animal cruelty reported in Bristol alone.\n\u201cSummer is a really challenging time for us - and we\u2019re braced for another busy season on the frontline, but we cannot do this alone,\u201d added Ms Coleman.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why our\u00a0\u2018No Animal Deserves Cruelty\u2019\u00a0summer appeal\u00a0seeks to tackle the rising and alarming levels of cruelty by raising vital funds to help those animals in desperate need - because every animal deserves kindness.\u201d\nStaff at the Ferne Animal Sanctuary in Chard, Somerset, are also feeling the pressure of caring for neglected and vulnerable animals.\nSince the charity first launched in 1939, the centre has rescued, rehabilitated, or rehomed some 40,000 animals.\nBut CEO Kevin Hodges said, \"it's never been this tough\". \n\u201cIn the last six-12 months, our increase in costs have been something like 50% year on year, an example of that being vet and medical by 60% alone,\" he said.\n\"That, for a charity like ours, is about a \u00a3350-\u00a3400,000 increase year on year.\"\nLast month, Mr Hodges took on the challenge of sleeping rough for a week to raise money and highlight the plight of animals that had been abandoned in taped up boxes on the side of the road.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The search is on to find living relatives of a town's war heroes who will be immortalised in new street names.\nRoads in Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, will be named after 11 World War Two service personnel and a jailed suffragette.\nThe town's deputy mayor, Gary Salmon, is tracking down descendants of the 12 people so they can attend an exhibition which will pay tribute to them.\nHe said he wanted relatives to know that, although the war was more than a century ago, those who gave their lives were not forgotten.\nThe roads to be named after the heroes of Higham Ferrers will serve a new estate of 330 homes being built by HarperCrewe Developers.\nThe site is located between the Ferrers School and the A6.\nHigham Ferrers Town Council was offered the chance to propose names for the roads and chose local war heroes and a suffragette.\nThe main route through the estate will be named Draper Road after William Ernest Draper, who lived on Kimbolton Road and served with the Northamptonshire Regiment. \nHe was killed on 27 September 1915, aged 31, and his name can be found on the Loos Memorial in Belgium, suggesting his remains were never found.\nGadsby Place honours Sidney Gadsby, who joined the Australian Infantry and died on 27 September 1917, aged 25.\nHis name is on the Menin Gate Memorial in Ypres, Belgium, where the Last Post is played every evening.\nLitchfield Drive will pay tribute to two brothers, Reginald and Thomas, who lived in Higham Ferrers and died while serving with the Canadian Army.\nReginald, who was just 19, was laid to rest at a cemetery in Belgium but Thomas's name appears on a war memorial in France, suggesting his body was never found.\nShipley Close is being named after the suffragette, Alice Maud Shipley, who was handed a four-month prison sentence after a window-smashing campaign on 19 March 1912.\nShe went on hunger strike in Holloway prison and had to be force-fed.\nThe deputy mayor of Higham Ferrers, Gary Salmon, said: \"We want to track down any living relatives to invite them to the exhibition, which will feature each of their stories and any photographs we can track down. \n\"We want the families to know that, although it is 110 years since the start of World War One, these servicemen have not been forgotten and neither has suffragette Shipley.\"\nHe added that street maps would be made to mark all the places where the heroes lived.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The cost of rural crime fell by more than a third in Shropshire last year, new figures have shown.\nIn its latest report, NFU Mutual (NFUM) shows the cost of claims last year fell by 35%, from \u00a33.6m in 2022 to \u00a32.4m in 2023, in contrast to a 4.3% rise in England as a whole.\nDavid Harrison, from NFUM, said the real concern was the impact on farmers, who lived on targeted farms with their families.\nThieves stole a \u00a340,000 loader from Dave Eardley's farm near Market Drayton in March, and despite the new figures, he believes rural crime is \"out of control.\"\n\"I don\u2019t think that we should be victims in our own home, where we have to lock everything up,\" he told BBC Midlands Today.\n\"There may have been more people here that we\u2019re not aware of in the night, or even in the day.\"\nMr Eardley described rural crime as \"rife\".\n\"Different areas are targeted, it might've gone down in this region, and up in others,\" he said.\nRural crime includes theft of vehicles, livestock, fuel, dogs attacking farm animals, fly-tipping and illegal waste dumping.\nNFUM believes the reduction in Shropshire is due to an \"increasingly co-ordinated response\" to crime, but said criminals were becoming more sophisticated.\nAcross the wider Midlands, there was also a reduction, but at 6.7% drop in the cost of claims.\nAndrew Chalk, from NFU Mutual, said although the statistics were great news for Shropshire, it was important not to get complacent.\n\"\u00a32.3m is still very high, that's still lots of farmers being preyed upon,\" he said.\nHe added that NFUM was seeing larger claims as a result of crime becoming more organised.\n\"There is an increasingly coordinated response to the threat of rural crime, we\u2019re hoping that that is actually bearing dividends in helping to drive down the numbers,\" he said.\nThe report showed that nationally, the number of agricultural vehicle thefts had fallen, whereas thefts of GPS units rose by 137%.\nGraham Donaldson, of West Mercia Police, believed a multi-agency approach was helping to reduce crime.\n\"We\u2019ve had a long running operation with colleagues at Dyfed-Powys Police and North Wales Police, which we called Operation Gander, which was targeting known criminals who specialise in thieving rural equipment.\"\n\"By police forces working together with NFU Mutual, and the NFU itself, it\u2019s a lot easier to track crime when we\u2019ve got the assistance of partner agencies.\"\nFollow BBC Shropshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Over the past few days, global stock markets have been plummeting.\nTrading screens across the US, Asia and, to a certain extent, Europe are awash with blinking red numbers heading south.  \nThe sudden turn comes as fears grow that the US economy - the world's biggest - is slowing down.\nExperts say the main reason for this fear is that US jobs data for July, released on Friday, was much worse than expected.\nHowever, for some, talk of an economic slowdown - or even a (whisper it) recession - is a little premature.\nSo, what did the official figures show us? As always with economics, there is good news and bad news.\nBad news first. US employers created 114,000 jobs in July which was way below expectations of 175,000 new roles.\nThe rate of unemployment also rose to 4.3%, a near three-year high, which triggered something known as the \"Sahm rule\".\nNamed after American economist Claudia Sahm, the rule says if the average unemployment rate over three months is half a percentage point higher than the lowest level over the past 12 months then the country is at the beginning of a recession.\nIn this case, the US unemployment rate rose in July, so the three-month average was 4.1%. That compares to the lowest level over the last year which was 3.5%.\nAdding to these concerns was the fact that the US Federal Reserve voted last week not to cut interest rates.\nOther central banks within developed economies, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, have recently cut interest rates.\nThe Fed held borrowing costs but its chair, Jerome Powell, signalled that a cut in September was on the table.\nHowever, this led to speculation that the Fed had waited too long to act.\nA cut in interest rates means it is cheaper to borrow money which should, in theory, act as a boost to the economy.\nIf the jobs figures suggest that the economy is already tipping downwards, then the fear is the Fed is too late.\nThen, on top of all this, are technology companies and their share prices. There has been a long-running rally in their shares, fuelled in part by optimism over artificial intelligence (AI). \nLast week, the chip-making giant Intel announced it was cutting 15,000 jobs. At the same time, market rumours suggested that rival Nvidia may have to delay the release of its new AI chip.\nWhat followed was a bloodbath on the Nasdaq, the technology-heavy US index. After hitting a high only a few weeks ago, it plunged by 10% on Friday. \nThat helped pump-up the fear factor across markets and that's where danger could lie.\nIf stock market panic continues and shares keep plunging the Fed could potentially step in before its next meeting in September and cut interest rates.\nThis could happen, according to Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, if there is \"a market dislocation that deepens and starts to threaten systemically important institutions and/or broader financial stability\".\nNow for the good(-ish) news.\n\u201cWe are not in a recession now,\" according to Ms Sahm herself, inventor of the rule.\nShe told CNBC on Monday that \"the momentum is in that direction\".\nBut she added: \u201cA recession is not inevitable and there is substantial scope to reduce interest rates.\u201d\nOthers are equivocal about the jobs data.\n\"While the report was bad it wasn\u2019t that bad,\" said Mr Shearing.\n\"It is likely that Hurricane Beryl contributed to weakness in July\u2019s payrolls figure. Other data painted a picture of a labour market that is cooling, but not collapsing,\" he said.\nHe added that there appeared to be \"no increase in firings\" while a \"modest\" decline in average weekly hours worked in July \"does not scream 'recession'\".\nFor Simon French, chief economist and head of research at Panmure Liberum, after digesting the US jobs data it's time to take a moment.\n\"Stepping back, have we suddenly re-appraised the health of the world\u2019s biggest economy? No and nor should we.\"\nBut he added: \"It is another data point at a time when liquidity is thin and you\u2019ve got a lot of things to worry about.\"",
    "Archaeologists have shed new light on the Roman history of an East Yorkshire town.\nA team working on a dig in Brough have uncovered evidence that fortifications were strengthened in the late 3rd Century, at a time when Britain was ruled by \"rebel\" emperors.\nAn artist's impression has been created to demonstrate the scale of the Roman fort, which was known as Petuaria and protected a major Roman centre.\nThe Petuaria ReVisited Project, which is leading the excavations, will be holding a open event on Sunday, from 10:00 to 16:00 BST. Visitors will be able to tour the site, view finds and take part in family activities.\nMartin Credland, Petuaria ReVisited project lead, said the open day would be an opportunity to see the latest development, with tours and talks explaining the recent finds.\nHe said: \"On our tours, anyone can come down and we'll show them around the site, we'll explain what we've found this year and in previous years, and how this all comes together to tell the story of Petuaria.\"\nMr Credland said he first became interested in the project as he was keen to change the focus on Brough away from aerospace and onto archaeology instead. \nMore than 100 volunteers, many new to archaeology, are taking part in the dig. \nThey are investigating the Roman defences at Burrs playing field, as well as a  Roman road in an adjacent garden. \nMr Credland said anyone could get involved, and described the volunteers who help excavate the site as \"diverse in every way\".\nHe said people who take part \"learn new skills, meet new people, and develop a new interest\" - as well as enjoying time spent outdoors.\n\"It's really nice to excavate. Our volunteers might find a piece of pottery or a ring made of brass or bone - but it's interesting to think of the romance behind that. Someone was wearing and lost that ring around 2,000 years ago,\" he said.\nBrough is thought to be on the site of the tribal capital of the Parisi, who lived in eastern Yorkshire during the Roman period.\nThe Roman walls have been known about since the 1930s, but digs in recent years have led to new discoveries.\nAn external tower, or bastion, found in 2023, resembles similar examples in Roman London, as well as those of the Saxon Shore forts, which were built to protect the south and east coasts of Roman Britain from raiders.\nIn the late 3rd Century, a commander called Carausius attempted to break away from Rome and declared himself emperor in Britain. He was assassinated in the year 293 by an ally called Allectus, who ruled for a further three years.\nA permanent display panel is now situated at the playing field, providing information about the discoveries. It has been funded with a government shared prosperity grant.\nGeophysical surveys and excavations have shown many buildings lie under the field.\nA grant from the Hull Maritime Project has also enabled surveys in gardens along Cave Road, which have revealed Roman buildings possibly associated with a small port at the edge of the tidal inlet.\nThe Petuaria ReVisited Project is run by the Elloughton Brough Playing Field Association in collaboration with the East Riding Archaeological Society.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "Monday has been declared the hottest day of the year in the UK so far, reaching 34.8C (95F) in Cambridge, according to the Met Office.\nThe higher temperatures have been confined to central and southern England and yellow heat health alerts are in place for millions of people.\nOthers experienced a wetter start to the day, with torrential rain further north - for which a now-expired yellow thunderstorm warning was in place.\nForecasters said Monday would see the peak of the current heat spike, with temperatures due to ease as the week continued. \nLondon, East Anglia and the home counties were forecast to experience the warmest weather.\nTemperatures had already exceeded 30C in the capital by midday on Monday, with several sites hitting over 32C by 13:30 BST.\nVarious parts of London, Writtle in Essex, and Wisley in Surrey all reached 33C - and temperatures of 32C were also recorded in areas ranging from East Malling in Kent to Holbeach in Lincolnshire. \nYellow heat health alerts, issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), are active in the East and West Midlands, East of England, South East and South West, North West and London.\nThey are due to expire by Wednesday morning. \nYellow alerts are issued during periods of hot weather that are only likely to affect those who are particularly vulnerable, for example the elderly, or those with existing health conditions.\nThe hottest day of 2024 before Monday was 30 July, when temperatures reached 32C in Kew Gardens and Heathrow - both in London.\nThis is only the eleventh year since 1961 that temperatures as high as 34.8C have been recorded, according to the Met Office's provisional figures.\nSix of those occasions have been in the last 10 years, the forecaster added.\nMany extreme weather events - including heatwaves - are becoming more frequent and intense as a result of climate change, experts say.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in the UK was 40.3C at Coningsby, Lincolnshire in July 2022.\nThe Met Office recommends that people keep curtains closed during the peak of the day and drink lots of water.\nIt was confirmed earlier that a child had died after being pulled from a canal in Wolverhampton on Sunday.\nA West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman said crews had found a boy in a critical condition and that, \"despite everyone's best efforts, the child could not be saved and he was confirmed dead at the scene\".\nThe RAC urged drivers to check the coolant and oil levels in their vehicles as high temperatures increase the risk of vehicle breakdowns and cars overheating.\nMeanwhile, National Rail also offered some advice, urging passengers travelling on Monday to check their journeys well in advance - though not because of the heat.\nThe Met Office \"has issued yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms in parts of Britain today,\" it said in a post on X, adding: \"Please check your journeys before you travel with National Rail or your train operator.\"\nTorrential downpours affected parts of Northern Ireland, Scotland and northern England earlier in the day. \n\"More than 15,000 lightning strikes have been recorded over the UK in the last 24 hours, mainly over Northern Ireland and northern Scotland,\" Ms Bishop, from the Met, said. \n\"Thundery showers are possible elsewhere in England this afternoon.\"\nThunderstorms are most frequent during the summer months as hot, humid air adds more energy to the atmosphere.",
    "The Australian city of Melbourne has banned rental electronic scooters with officials saying they posed unacceptable safety risks.\nThe U-turn by the city\u2019s council comes after it first welcomed the scooters in February 2022, saying they would operate a two-year trial.\nHowever, hundreds of accidents since then have sparked complaints and outrage from the public.\nMelbourne's mayor said he was \"fed up\" with the bad behaviour of some scooter users.\n\u201cToo many people [are] riding on footpaths. People don\u2019t park them properly. They\u2019re tipped, they\u2019re scattered around the city like confetti, like rubbish, creating tripping hazards,\u201d Nicholas Reece told local radio station 3AW.\nMelbourne is just the latest city in the world to remove hire scooters - which can go at up to 26km/h (16mph) - after a brief period of operation. The French capital Paris outlawed them last September - Mr Reece said he wanted to copy \"the Paris option\".\nCity councillors voted 6-4 on Tuesday evening local time to ban the scooters almost immediately.\nOperators Lime and Neuron have been ordered to remove the scooters within 30 days.\nThe companies still had six months left on their contracts to operate the vehicles and had been campaigning heavily in recent weeks, urging users to petition the council.\nBoth companies said they had invested significantly in recent months to improve safety and regulations around the use of scooters - with Neuron saying it was planning on installing AI cameras on scooters to prevent misuse.\nA spokesman for the company decried the city council's blanket ban on Tuesday, saying they had been in discussions with city officials to introduce measures like restricting the scooter use to less congested parts of the city, or setting up riding zones.\n\u201cThis goes over and above the reforms announced by the state government,\u201d Jayden Bryant from Neuron had earlier told Australian media.\n\u201cIt is very odd that [a different] tabled proposal for the introduction of new e-scooter technology can change to become a proposal for a ban.\u201d\nAbout 1,500 Lime and Neuron scooters had been distributed across the city since the trial's inception in February 2022.\nMelbourne city council had previously reported that scooters had cut the city's carbon emissions by more than 400 tonnes and encouraged greater take-up of public transport.\nBut there has also been growing evidence of the scheme's flaws. One of the city's main hospitals, the Royal Melbourne hospital, published a report in December 2023 which found close to 250 scooter-riders presented at its emergency department with injuries in 2022. A majority of these involved factors such as intoxication, speeding and not wearing a helmet.\nA hospital spokesman said e-scooter accidents had even caused deaths and brain damage, with injuries mainly among younger patients.",
    "A Scottish charity that supports women from minority and ethnic communities is being investigated by the regulator over allegations including financial irregularities and \u201cbullying\u201d.\nOSCR, the Scottish charities regulator, said it has opened an inquiry into Amina Muslim Women\u2019s Resource Centre (MWRC).\nThe charity\u2019s CEO, Mariam Ahmed, responded by describing the claims as \u201cunfounded\u201d.\nAmina supports women from black, ethnic and minority backgrounds on a range of issues including domestic abuse, employment and financial security.\nAn OSCR spokesperson said: \"We can confirm that we have received concerns about Amina.\n\u201cFollowing our assessment of these, we have opened an inquiry into the charity. As this process is ongoing, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\u201d\nThe charity is continuing to operate as normal while the inquiry takes place.\nThe BBC understands the regulator is investigating governance matters as well as financial management including alleged discrepancies in expenditure and consultancy fees, accuracy of record keeping and an alleged lack of financial controls.\nThe inquiry has been sparked by a complaint that some trustees said they were not given satisfactory answers when enquiring about expenditure costs, which they claim were not approved by the board.\nOther allegations in the complaint include the fostering of a \u201ctoxic\u201d workplace culture.\nAmina has operated in Scotland for 26 years, running drop-in clinics and a helpline, which received more than 2500 calls in 2022-2023.\nIn that year the helpline directly supported 169 women, the majority of whom were victims of domestic abuse.\nAmina also provides a hardship fund to those in need, runs language classes, support groups, and offers an advocacy service.\nThe charity says it aims to break down the barriers faced by women of colour. It is based in Glasgow but also has an office in Dundee, and runs events throughout Scotland.\nIt is run by a team of staff, volunteers and a board of ten trustees.\nIn Amina\u2019s last publicly available accounts for 2022-2023, it recorded an income of just under \u00a3650,000 with more than \u00a3600,000 of that being spent on salaries and running costs.\nIt is funded by a number of public and charitable organisations via grants, with the main source of income being the Scottish Government. The charity has also received funding from the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport.\nAmina CEO, Mariam Ahmed, said: \u201cWe\u2019re aware of unfounded allegations against Amina MWRC and we are complying with OSCR with full transparency.

    "Political prisoner Vladimir Kara-Murza is now free after spending over two years - 11 months of them in solitary confinement - in one of Russia's \"harshest prison regimes\". \nHe described his life in prison as \"endless, meaningless and exactly the same\", akin to the movie Groundhog Day. \n\"Just a few weeks ago, I was absolutely certain I would die in Putin's gulag,\" he told the Washington Post on Wednesday. \nMr Kara-Murza, a Russian writer and activist, was one of 24 prisoners released on 1 August in the largest Russia-west prisoner exchange since the Cold War. \nMr Kara-Murza, who is also a British citizen, was arrested in 2022 for his strong opposition to the invasion of Ukraine.\nHe was held in a facility in Omsk, which he described as one of the harshest prisons in the country. \nHis day started at 05:00 local time in a small cell about 2 by 3 meters (7 by 10 feet). Everything was scheduled - from his meals to his walks to when the lights would be turned off. Most of his day was spent staring at a wall. \n\"You're just sitting in your cell essentially doing nothing,\" he said. \nHe was given a pen and paper and allowed to write for 90 minutes each day.\n\u201cTo somebody whose profession is writing as it is in my case, I have to say that\u2019s a particularly sadistic rule,\" he said. \nMr Kara-Murza was kept in solitary confinement for 11 months. United Nations rules consider confinement to be torture if a person is held without human contact for more than 22 hours per day on at least 15 consecutive days. \nHe wasn't allowed to contact his family by telephone and only spoke with his wife once in the two years he was jailed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not easy when you\u2019re just completely deprived of any human contact,\" he said. \nTo pass the time, Mr Kara-Murza said he read as much as he could and learned Spanish.  \nHe recalled that prisoners would be regularly asked to state their tentative release date as well as their names and cell numbers. His - which he will never forget - was 21 April 2047. \n\"Frankly, it really gets to you,\" he said of the repeated demand. \nMr Kara-Murza said three factors kept him from giving up while in prison: His Christian faith, his background as a historian and knowing \"that he was right\".\n\"This knowledge is really important because I knew that I was right.

    "Eluned Morgan has been confirmed as the first female first minister of Wales, following a vote in the Welsh Parliament.\nThe Senedd was recalled from its summer break to nominate her, after Vaughan Gething resigned.\nMembers of the Senedd (MSs) were able to take part in the vote virtually, including from abroad.\nMs Morgan said it was \"the greatest honour of my life to stand before you today as the first woman to become the first minister of Wales\".\nMs Morgan became leader of Welsh Labour last month, after being elected unopposed, and has been health minister since May 2021.\nOn Tuesday in the Senedd, after being nominated by Mr Gething, she was backed by 28 MSs, Conservative Andrew RT Davies received 15 votes and Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth 12. The only Liberal Democrat, Jane Dodds, abstained.\nMs Morgan's name was then sent to the King who gave his approval, allowing the new first minister to officially take office.\nMs Morgan, who became the sixth Welsh first minister, thanked Mr Gething for his service, describing him as a \"true trailblazer\" on Wales' \"devolution journey\". \nMr Gething was Wales' first black first minister. \n\"As I take up the mantle of leadership I promise to honour [my predecessor's] achievements and add my own contributions to this legacy,\" she told the Senedd.\n\"Perhaps with a vibrant splash of colour - the grey suits are out.\"\nMr Gething quit last month after four members of his cabinet resigned.\nHis leadership was mired in controversy after he accepted donations from a man twice convicted of environmental offences during his election campaign.\nThe sacking of one of his cabinet ministers over leaked messages also caused a row within the party.\nMs Morgan told MSs that she looked forward to the day when a \"woman becoming first minister is no longer extraordinary but a normal part of our Welsh political life\".\nShe told women watching events in Cardiff Bay \"you need to know your potential is limitless\".\n\"The path to leadership is not now just a possibility, it's a reality,\" she said. \nAfter a period of infighting within the Welsh Labour group, which she described as \"difficult\", Ms Morgan said \"we must work to restore trust\".\n\"Wales is warm and welcoming nation and our political discourse needs to reflect that.\"\n\"Our differences should be a source of strength, not a source of division,\" she said.\n\"We have been through some turmoil, but we know we are best when we work in unity, as a party and nation.\"\nPledging to focus on achievement and delivery, she warned of \"tough decisions\" because of what she called the \"dire\" state of UK public finances.\nMs Morgan previously ran to be Welsh Labour leader and first minister in 2018, coming third behind  Mark Drakeford and Vaughan Gething.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer spoke to Ms Morgan on Tuesday evening, after an earlier statement offering his \"heartfelt congratulations and support\".\nIn the statement the UK Labour leader said she had \"today made history as the first ever woman to become first minister of Wales\".\n\u201cEluned has a long history of public service and her commitment to delivering for the people of Wales is unwavering,\" he said. \nIn a nod to the turmoil that has engulfed Welsh Labour in recent months which led to her appointment, the prime minister added: \"I know she will lead a unified and ambitious Welsh government.\n\u201cLabour in Wales and Westminster will work side by side firmly in the service of working people.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies congratulated Ms Morgan on winning the top job, but warned that \"for the last few months, the Welsh Labour government has been so busy with infighting it has further neglected our public services\".\n\"Wales needs someone in the top job now who can drive down our waiting lists, improve educational attainment and turbocharge our economy,\" he said.\n\u201cSadly, on the basis of her record, there is little reason to believe Eluned Morgan will be that person.\u201d\nPlaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth called for a Senedd election, 21 months before one is due to take place to end the \"revolving door of first minsters\".\nWales has now had three first ministers since March, when Mr Gething replaced his predecessor Mark Drakeford.\nWith 30 of the 60 seats in Cardiff Bay, Labour needs opposition help to govern, and Plaid pulled its support from a cooperation agreement with Welsh ministers during Vaughan Gething's administration.\nMr ap Iorwerth said he had \"no intention to do a budget deal with Welsh Labour\".\n\"We will look at things in a mature way, but whilst always telling the people of Wales now at this crucial juncture, less than two years from the next Senedd election, there is a different way of doing politics,\" he said.\nWelsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds, and the party's only MS, said she was \"delighted to see another woman leading the way in Welsh politics\".\nShe said that \"with the new government in Westminster and a new first minister, we have a real opportunity here in Wales to demonstrate a ",
    "As ferocious flames ripped through the 18th Century \"wonkiest pub\", a slice of history and the apple of the Black Country\u2019s eye was razed.\nBut grief of the legion of The Crooked House lovers would quickly turn to anger when less than 48 hours after the blaze, on 5 August 2023, the hostelry was demolished overnight.\nAs the dawn broke, revealing a pile of bricks, the local outcry led to rage as far away as Australia and the US, as supporters called for the iconic watering hole to be rebuilt, exactly as it had been.\nOne year on, campaigners speak of how their anger galvanised a movement to protect the UK's heritage buildings - while the pub is no more, it has become a symbol of resistance.\n\"You could feel the heat of the flames burning you, just watching these images and the pub trying to withstand the diggers, it was like a personal loss,\" said Save The Crooked House campaigner Ian Sandall.\nThrough Facebook, he and his fellow activists have amassed nearly 38,000 people worldwide supporting the cause.\nSpeaking before a campaign event, Liz Shanley added: \"We want to keep it at the forefront of people\u2019s minds, we want to remind people that as a campaign group we\u2019re still as passionate as we were on the day of the fire and destruction.\" \nWithin the last year, the community have vehemently fought to preserve the pub's legacy, backed by former West Midlands mayor Andy Street, and former Conservative MP for Dudley North, Marco Longhi.\nAnd their efforts have by no means been in vain, especially because South Staffordshire Council served an enforcement notice on the pub's owners in February, ordering them to rebuild it.\nIt was served to ATE Farms Limited, the company that owns the pub, as well as the company's director George Adam Taylor, and former director Carly Taylor who stepped down in December.\nThey have since lodged an appeal and proposed rebuilding the pub in a different location. A public inquiry to decide whether they do rebuild has been postponed to spring 2025.\nDescribing his passion behind the campaign, Mr Sandall added: \"You can\u2019t feel that way about something, without wanting to stand up and do something, that was the urge, we've got to do something to protect this pub.\n\"I'm still grieving for the pub a year on, and that is our determination, our drive to carry on with what we are doing.\"\nThe movement has reached all corners of the world as one campaigner, Megan Wakeman, has painted an image of the pub on to more than 100 rocks, which have then been transported and hidden as far as Nepal and the Dominican Republic.\nWhile investigating the arson attack, detectives arrested six people - five men and one woman, aged between 23 and 66 at the time last year - but Staffordshire Police announced earlier this week that they have been released from bail but remain under investigation, as inquiries continue.\nPaul Turner, a campaigner, recalled: \"I was absolutely devastated, it had been there all my life, all my dad's life, all my grandad's life, it had been there for generations.\n\"With this campaign and the fight to get it back, once that's achieved the history of the place will be even more rich than it ever was.\"\nWith its bricks all safely stored away, a planning inspector hearing next year will decide the pub's future.\nBuilding specialists have said it is technically possible to recreate the leaning building, but the process would require careful consideration.\nArchitects have deemed The Crooked House as a unique case, because of its building, history and location.\nThe inn itself dated back to the 18th Century when, in 1765, it was built as a farmhouse. In about 1830, it was converted into a pub and named the Glynne Arms, after local landowner Sir Stephen Glynne.\nThe \"crooked-ness\" began in the middle of the 19th Century when, because of mining work in the area, the building began to subside on one side.\nThe lean was about 15 degrees and the building would have collapsed on its own, had it not been shored up with buttresses, the Lower Gornal local history group said.\nThe rescue work took the pub into the 20th Century until, in the 1940s, it was condemned and faced demolition. At the last minute though, those faithful buttresses on the south side were further strengthened.\nToday though, it is still not clear how gradual the effect of subsidence was or why the decision was made to shore up the structure, Colin Morris, from the local history group, said.\nBut, its wonkiness was brought to national attention, when the BBC's Nationwide programme visited in September 1974, with a reporter making much of how bottles and other objects appeared to defy gravity by seeming to roll uphill.\nSince then, many have said they have tried the same trick with marbles, including Cora Barras who, on a visit from Northern Ireland with her daughter, said \"the thrill of trying to figure out\" what was going on was \"such fun\".\nThe shockwaves over the demolition continue to reverberate, with pub lovers nominating 65 hostelries, including ",

    "Police Scotland has confirmed it is to dispose of four offices in Aberdeen while creating two new \"response hubs\" to serve communities in the city.\nThe stations at Mastrick, Whinhill, Rosemount and Torry have all been declared surplus to requirements following a consultation.\nA new hub, taking in officers previously based at Mastrick, Whinhill and Rosemount, will be created at Woodhill House, the headquarters of Aberdeenshire Council, where some police staff are already based.\nOfficers from Torry will move to another new hub at the existing Nigg police station in the south of the city.\nThe closures have been criticised by the organisation representing rank and file police officers. \nDavid Threadgold, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said ''Police Scotland said in a document that the communities of Torry and Mastrick experience poorer outcomes than the rest of Aberdeen. \n\"So they identify that there is clearly a need for a policing presence in Aberdeen.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2019The notion that Nigg or Woodhill House are somehow modern estate buildings is simply misleading. \n\"They are no more modern than Torry, which was only knocked down and rebuilt in the last fifteen years or so. That is a modern police station that is exactly where it needs to be.\n\"The decision to close it is purely down to finance. It makes no policing sense.''\nPolice Scotland said its presence in communities is not defined by buildings but by officers and staff who work in the area. \nIt said it was committed to maintaining a strong presence across Aberdeen and ensuring the safety of local communities.\nDivisional commander for the north east, Ch Supt Graeme Mackie said \u201cWe recognise that having lots of small teams spread across the city has restricted information sharing, learning and also impacted on the wellbeing of our staff. \n\"Creating larger hubs at Woodhill House and Nigg, will create a more efficient and effective policing service for our communities.\"\nThe Scotland-wide estates review was launched in December 2023. In February this year Police Scotland announced that the Seaton station in Aberdeen was surplus to requirements and it has since been disposed of. \nThe Nigg response hub is expected to begin operating later this year, with the one at Woodhill House opening in early 2025.",
    "A shop security guard has described how he helped save an 11-year-old girl as she was being attacked by a knifeman in London's Leicester Square.\nIn a statement, the Met Police said a 32-year-old man had been arrested and taken into custody after the girl and her 34-year-old mother were stabbed.  \nAbdullah, 29, who works at TWG tea in Leicester Square, said he intervened to stop the attacker and, with help from colleagues, gave first aid to the child. \nThe Met said it was \"not looking for anyone else\" in connection with the attack and does not believe the victims knew their attacker. It also said at this stage there was no suggestion the stabbing was terror-related.\nThe force added the girl required hospital treatment for \"serious\" but not life-threatening injuries, while her mother's wounds were \"more minor\". \nPolice officers remain at the scene, which is in one of the busiest tourist districts in the capital.\nAbdullah told the BBC he had heard \"a scream\", so he \"jumped on the attacker... and kicked the knife away from him\".\n\"I heard a scream and I  just went outside and saw one guy had a knife,\" he explained.\n\"The moment I saw it I just jumped on that guy and grabbed his hand... and put him down on the floor and kicked the knife away from him.\"\nHe said a couple of other men also came over to help and held the man down for \"four to five\" minutes, adding he decided to take action because \"I had no time, I just didn't think\".\n\"It's horrible to be honest; I've never seen anything like that before,\" Abdullah said.\n\"To do this to a kid, it's horrible.\"\nHe added he and his colleagues gave first aid to the child before the police took over.\n\"I just saw a kid getting stabbed and I just tried to save her,\" he said.\n\"It's my duty to just save them.\"\nAnother eyewitness, called Jacqueline, said she \"heard a loud scream\" and ran straight over to find a \"horrific\" scene.\n\"I saw a young girl on the floor with her mum... and a few guys tackled the man to the floor.\n\"It just happened so quickly.

    "A far-right Israeli minister has led hundreds of Jewish Israelis into Jerusalem\u2019s most contested holy site, with many defying the Israeli government\u2019s long-standing ban on Jewish prayer there.\nThe visit by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount, has been condemned as provocative by Palestinian leaders, as well as the US, France, the UN and several Arab states.\nMr Ben-Gvir said in a video that \u201cour policy is to enable Jewish prayer\u201d.\nBut the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office insisted there had been no change to the status quo agreement that allows only Muslim worship there.\nThe site is the holiest place for Jews because it was the site of two Biblical temples. It is the third holiest place for Muslims, who believe it was where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.\nSituated in occupied East Jerusalem, it was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Under the status quo, Jordan was allowed to continue its historical role as custodian of the site, while Israel assumed control of security and access.\nPalestinians accuse Israel of taking steps to undermine the arrangements and complain that in recent years Jewish visitors have often been seen praying without being stopped by Israeli police.\nVideos shared on social media on Tuesday showed groups of Jewish Israelis singing the Israeli national anthem, some carrying the Israeli flag while others prostrate themselves in prayer at the edge of the holy site.\nVisiting the compound escorted by Israeli police, Itamar Ben Gvir, said \u201cgreat progress\u201d had been made in Israel\u2019s \u201cgovernance and sovereignty\u201d there. \u201cOur policy is to enable Jewish prayer,\u201d he went on.\nHe also declared that Israel \u201cmust win the war\u201d in the Gaza Strip, and should not get involved in the talks on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in order to \u201cbring Hamas to its knees\u201d.\nLater, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said the incident had \u201cdeviated from the status quo.\u201d\n\u201cIsrael's policy on the Temple Mount has not changed; this is how it has been and this is how it will be,\u201d it stressed.\nIn response to the statement, Mr Ben-Gvir said that it was his own policy to \u201cenable freedom of worship for Jews in all places\u201d.\n\u201cThere is no law that permits engaging in racist discrimination against Jews at the Temple Mount or anywhere else in Israel,\u201d he added.\nHowever, the Palestinian foreign ministry expressed great concern about what it called \u201cthe dangerous escalation resulting from the raids by extremist settlers on the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque\u201d.\n\u201cThe ministry will continue its political efforts to address these provocations at various levels, warning of their serious consequences on the conflict arena and the region as a whole,\u201d a statement said.\nThe Jordanian Islamic endowment which administers the site, the Waqf, said more than 2,000 Israelis had entered the compound and appealed to Muslims across the world to help it maintain the status quo.\nJordan\u2019s foreign ministry said the incident reflected \u201cthe insistence of the Israeli government and its extremist members to flout international laws and Israel\u2019s obligations as the occupying power\u201d.\nEgypt and Saudi Arabia also said the incident violated international law, with the former adding that Mr Ben-Gvir was seeking to scupper attempts to broker a Gaza ceasefire deal.\nIn a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Mr Ben-Gvir's visit \"demonstrated blatant disregard for the historic status quo with respect to the holy sites in Jerusalem. \n\"These provocative actions only exacerbate tensions at a pivotal moment when all focus should be on the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire agreement and secure the release of all hostages and create the conditions for broader regional stability,\" the US's top diplomat added.\nThe French foreign ministry condemned Mr Ben-Gvir's visit, saying: \"This new provocation is unacceptable\".\nUN spokesperson Farhan Haq called the incident \u201cunhelpful and unduly provocative\u201d, adding: \"We are against any efforts to change the status quo within the holy sites.\u201d",
    "Cancer patients in Leeds could be invited to take part in a trial of a new type of treatment using personalised vaccines in a bid to help stop the disease returning.\nLeeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it would refer eligible people to an NHS programme to boost participation in the trial, which uses mRNA technology like that found in Covid jabs.\nThe vaccines were designed to prime the immune system to recognise and destroy any remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of the disease recurring, the trust said.\nProfessor Chris Twelves, from the trust's Clinical Research Facility, said the advent of such anti-cancer treatments was \"a real game-changer\".\nProf Twelves said people with early stage bowel cancer were currently being recruited for the trial, but if the results continued to be encouraging, then the vaccines could be used for people with other cancers.\nSo far a \"handful\" of patients from Leeds had been picked as being suitable for the trial, which was being run at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust in Manchester, he said.\nLeeds had been chosen to work on the Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad programme because of the city's diverse population, Prof Twelves added.\n\"There are real health needs of the people in Leeds and there is an increasing awareness among doctors and drug companies that we want to develop treatments here that are relevant to the poeple who need them the most,\" he said.\nVaccines are usually designed to prevent disease, but cancer vaccines are created as a treatment once someone has been diagnosed.\nPatients who agree to take part have a sample of their cancer tissue and a blood test taken.\nThe cancer vaccines being trialled are based on a molecule called mRNA, the same technology used for the Covid-19 vaccine.\nThey are created by analysing a patient\u2019s tumour to identify mutations specific to their own cancer. \nUsing this information, medics can create an individualised cancer vaccine.\nJust as with conventional vaccines, these then prime the immune system to look for an enemy, in this case the patient\u2019s cancer, and potentially destroy any remaining cancer cells.\nProf Twelves, who is also a cancer consultant, stressed the importance of clinical trials in developing successful treatments for the disease.\n\"When we take a new drug and look to see whether there are promising signs and then look at it in larger groups and see there is, indeed, an advance in current treatment, then that's the way we really take cancer treatments forward,\" he said.\n\"That then translates into people with cancer now living longer, having more patients cured and an improved quality of life.\n\"And that really is all building on people taking part in clinical trials such as this vaccine study.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "Officers were \"stretched\" when far-right protestors attempted to target a hotel thought to be housing asylum seekers, Bristol's police and crime commissioner said.\nThe group, and a counter-protest group, gathered to demonstrate in Castle Park on Saturday, before they moved to the Mercure Hotel.\nSeventeen people have been arrested and two men have been charged for public order offences.\nClare Moody, Avon and Somerset police and crime commissioner, said: \"The police were stretched across a lot of the city. There are lessons that need to be learned.\"\nDuring the protest outside Mercure Hotel on Redcliffe Hill, guests were seen looking out of their windows.\nSpeaking to Joe Sims on BBC Radio Bristol, Ms Moody said she expected more arrests - confirmed by Det Ch Con Reilly who said on Monday evening that the \"arrest of those responsible will continue over the coming days\".\nShe said: \"There was a lot of action going on across the city. The police were stretched across a lot of the city. \n\"There are lessons that need to be learned, but I'm pleased Bristol was a city of sanctuary and we saw the people of Bristol stand to protect those in the hotel. \n\"I'm very pleased we didn't see the same scenes we've seen elsewhere.\"\nShe said the scenes around England on Saturday, that included windows being smashed, are \"genuinely shocking\".\n\"There was no legitimate reason that can justify what happened,\" she said.\n\"They were out to cause trouble, violent and it was unacceptable and was, I'm glad to say, prevented from doing further harm.\"\nShe added there is \"no excuse for the criminal behaviour we saw\".\n\"There's a world of difference between legitimate protest that's about political debate, and we've seen Bristol have protests on its streets for generations, but that's not the same as what we saw. \n\"In a calm, reflective way we can have those political conversations. That's no excuse for the criminal behaviour we saw.\"\nTensions have been high across England after the killing of three young girls in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July.\nJoe Wagstaff was on a night out with friends at Pasture, a restaurant near the hotel, when he said some of the crowd threw \"plates, glasses and bottles\".\nHe helped rescue a dog from on an outdoor table with its owner, Philippa Swatton.\nHe told the BBC he saw \"lots of guys in balaclavas chanting some really dreadful things on their way to the hotel\".\n\u201cThe staff inside were trying to bring everyone in and clearing everything off the tables.

    "A woman turned down two chances to see Billy Joel -  but then saw him close up, when she interpreted at his only European tour date in Cardiff.\nSign language interpreter Ali Gordon, from London, was introduced to the music of the US singer-songwriter through her girlfriend.\n\"Through Lesley I have heard a lot of Billy Joel, and I have never quite fancied it (seeing him live),\" she admitted, adding: \"But over the years I have got to really appreciate what a great musician he is.\"\nShe said it was a real privilege to be at the Principality Stadium on Friday and help illustrate lyrics to hits such as Piano Man, Uptown Girl and Just the Way You Are.\nAli, 59, has been interpreting for nearly 20 years, and signing at gigs for about five.\n\"It's challenging but really exciting,\" she said. \n\"It\u2019s different to the official sign language because there are short cuts that you can use so you don't have to sign every word, you're creating a visual so it's hopefully coherent for the person watching.\"\nShe added the key thing was to show the music, adding: \"It's a really interesting logistical challenge.\n\"It's not just about the words, but getting the rhythm and the beat of the music and the facial expression, what's happening with your body is part of the language.\n\"The intensity will show on your face, it isn't just about how quick or slow you sign - it is embodying the music and the lyrics.\"\nAli has interpreted for Earth, Wind & Fire, Kool & the Gang, Young Fathers and David Attenborough.\nShe said it was important that gigs were accessible for everyone, including the deaf community.\n\"Deaf people still want to enjoy a cultural life just like everyone else,\" she said.\n\"They can still enjoy music in all manner of ways. The point isn't that you're deaf so you can't hear, but you're enjoying the visible nature and you will get an interpretation of the songs.\n\"But most importantly, a deaf person will be able to enjoy an artist they have grown to love.\"\nShe added that it was great that Performance Interpreting had been able to provide BSL at festivals and concerts.\nAli spent about 24 hour hours over the last two-and-a-half weeks practicing for the performance.\n\"When prepping for a gig I look at the set list that they may have performed at other cities if they are touring, and then create a Spotify set list that I will play and just listen to incidentally and have one while I am doing the housework or driving,\" she said. \n\"Just listening to the rhythm, and then once I have that down I then look at the lyrics and figure out how I sign them, what are they saying, what is the tone, and I will try out a number of ways to sign and go with what feels right.\"\nFor Joel's concert she only got the set list on Tuesday, and although most of the songs were on there, there were a few surprises.\nShe said: \"It was about nailing the finishing touches for the songs I knew and then getting the others down.\"\nLuckily Ali was not the only signer on the night, and had another interpreter with her, and they divided the songs between them.\nThey were not on stage with Joel, but on a platform with the accessibility viewing area in front of her.\n\"It is just a real privilege to get down and dirty with Billy Joel's lyrics. He is such a clever songwriter,\" she said.",
    "An asylum seeker says he thought he was going to die after masked rioters broke into the hotel he was staying in during violent unrest in Rotherham.\nAbdullah, an Iraqi Kurd, had been in the UK for four months, having arrived in the country by boat, when the incident took place at the Holiday Inn Express in Manvers.\nFootage taken by Abdullah and others from inside the hotel, which came under attack by a large crowd on 4 August - Abdullah's birthday - shows people shouting threats and obscenities at those inside.\nOther video filmed by Abdullah shows protesters attacking a police van as well as smashed windows and panic inside the hotel.\nOne man, with his face covered, can be seen pulling his finger across his throat to suggest a knife cutting it.\nThe violence at the hotel - including rioters starting fires - came in the wake of the fatal knife attack in Southport, which left three girls dead. Unrest spread around the country in the aftermath of the stabbings, fuelled by misinformation relating to anti-immigration sentiments on social media. \nAbdullah, who asked for his surname not to be used, described being confronted by masked people inside the hotel and how the incident has impacted him since.\nHe says the violent scenes he witnessed began with two opposing sides protesting outside - but that the pro-immigration protesters were led away from the scene by police when they became outnumbered.\nAbdullah told the BBC the incident started around 10:00 BST and lasted \"a long time\", until around 17:00 or 18:00. \nFootage shows crowds outside surging at police lines, throwing rocks and missiles at windows and setting wheelie bins on fire next to broken windows. \nIn video seen by the BBC, taken by Abdullah, people can be seen trying to overturn a police van. Inside the hotel, debris and smashed glass appears strewn across floors, while one official is heard telling panicked guests to please stay in their rooms, as others rush along the corridor.\n\u201cWe [were] all scared,\u201d Abdullah told the BBC. \u201cWe saw everyone kicking the police - that\u2019s why we are scared, when someone kicks the police, they can kick me too, because we are just a normal person.\u201d\nAbdullah had been in a friend\u2019s room, but he then returned to his own room on the second floor. When he got there, the window had been smashed and his room was full of smoke.\n\u201cInside is all fire,\u201d he added. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t breathe and... we all have stress because we think today we will die.\u201d\nAbdullah said he then went back into the corridor, where he was faced with masked protesters who had broken into the hotel and come up to the second floor.\n\u201cI go outside of my room and I saw the five people with masks, black masks. I couldn\u2019t see their faces. And he said \u2018come to me, you want to fight with me?\u2019. But the police came and he saved me, he protected me.\n\"If the police weren\u2019t there, maybe I will be dead. We were scared, all scared\u2026 We couldn\u2019t think what we could do.\"\nAt the time, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the incident as \"far-right thuggery\".\nSouth Yorkshire Police described the violence as \"nothing short of disgusting\" and have since said more than 60 officers were injured in the incident, alongside four police dogs and a police horse.\nEarlier on Thursday, the force said 38 people had been charged over the unrest, and 20 had been convicted. \nLater, three men were jailed over the incident, bringing the number who have been sentenced to 11.\nAbdullah has now been moved, like all those housed in the Rotherham hotel.\nBut the incident has affected him.\n\u201cI\u2019m still scared, when I go to outside here I\u2019m still scared. When I see another person I go to the other side. I think it is better because I don\u2019t want to have any problem, because of what happened\u2026 I can\u2019t forget it you know.\u201d\nHe says he understands why some people feel resentment, but he also knows they do not represent everyone\u2019s views.\n\u201cWhat happened in Rotherham, that\u2019s not right. That\u2019s all confused people. If I have (made) any mistake, you can say anything, but I (haven\u2019t made) any mistakes\u2026\n\"I know why the people are angry, but that\u2019s not [a reason] to want to kill me\u201d.\nHe hopes he will be able to settle in the UK before long.\n\u201cI want to go to work but I can\u2019t... maybe after six months or one year I can go to work - I want to have a job, I want to pay tax like everybody.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Harrison Jones and Mary Litchfield",

    "A jury heard opening statements on Wednesday in the trial of a former Las Vegas official accused of murdering a reporter who wrote negative articles about him.\nFormer Clark County Public Administrator Robert Telles has been jailed since 2022 for allegedly stabbing Las Vegas Review-Journal investigative reporter Jeff German. \nMr Telles has pleaded not guilty and says he was framed by police. \nHe faces a life sentence if convicted. \nMr German, 69, was stabbed to death outside his Nevada home on 2 September 2022. \nAs part of his coverage of crime and government corruption, he had written four articles about Mr Telles, who was elected in 2018, alleging hostile behaviour in his office and an affair with a subordinate. Mr German had one more article to publish about Mr Telles at the time of his death. \nAfter the first story came out, Mr Telles, a Democrat, lost his primary bid for re-election. \nFour women had told Mr German the agency turned into a toxic workplace,   beginning after Mr Telles took office in January 2019. They alleged that Mr Telles, 47, threatened them and ordered them not to speak to each other. \nThey also took video of him in the backseat of a car with a subordinate, which appeared to be part of an inappropriate relationship.\nMr German was off work at his home on the day he was killed. \nSurveillance video shows an individual, wearing a straw sunhat and an orange reflective shirt, approach his yard and sneak in through a gate. \nThe video also shows Mr German fall to the ground.\n A neighbour discovered his body 24 hours later. \nHe was stabbed seven times - four in the neck and three in the torso. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Mr German was the only journalist in 2022 killed in the United States. \nThe staff of the Las Vegas Review-Journal began investigating Mr German's death almost immediately, brainstorming a list of people to look into based on Mr German's prior reporting. \nOne of those names was Mr Telles. \nThe journalists discovered he was arrested while in office on charges of domestic battery and resisting arrest for choking his wife. \nThey turned also to the surveillance video. A photographer who had filmed Mr Telles walking during an interview said the assailant had the same gait. \nWhen police released a photo of the suspect's car, an editor searched Mr Telles' home address on Google Earth and found the same vehicle parked in the driveway. \nThen a photographer went to the Telles house and got a shot of the former public administrator washing the car. \nFive days after Mr German's murder, police brought Mr Telles in for questioning and began executing search warrants. \nDetectives collected DNA from Mr Telles that matched samples taken from under Mr German's fingernails. \nThey also found a straw sunhat cut into pieces in his garage. \nMr Telles was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and indicted by a grand jury for murder with use of a dead weapon.\nHe pleaded not guilty and has been awaiting trial since his arrest.

    "Within hours of Tim Walz being declared winner of the Democratic \"veepstakes\", Republican accusations that he is pro-China came thick and fast.\n\"Communist China is very happy,\" Donald Trump's former ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said on Twitter/X. \"No one is more pro-China than Marxist Walz.\"\nTom Cotton, a Republican senator, said Mr Walz owed an explanation \"about his unusual, 35-year relationship with Communist China\".\nMAGA War Room, an influential X account supporting Donald Trump, unearthed a 2016 video in which Mr Walz told the farming policy outlet Agri-Pulse that the US and China did not need to have an \"adversarial relationship\".\nBut what does the record show? Republicans may want to weaponise Mr Walz's links to China, but it's pretty slim pickings.\nMr Walz's personal relationship with China does indeed extend back decades. \nIt began in 1989 when, fresh out of college, Mr Walz began a Harvard University volunteer programme teaching American history and English at the Foshan No 1 High School in southern China.\nHe later set up a business with his wife Gwen organising annual summer educational trips to China. The venture lasted more than a decade and by his own estimation, Mr Walz returned to the country around 30 times.\n\nBut if anything, Mr Walz has been pretty hawkish towards its government, particularly on human rights.\nAs a congressman, he met the Dalai Lama and \u2013 before his jailing \u2013 the high-profile Hong Kong democracy activist, Joshua Wong. Both men would place at the top of the Chinese government\u2019s list of public enemies.\nIn terms of his congressional record, there is not much for China to like.\nHe spent over a decade on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China \u2013 a body focused on scrutinising the Chinese government\u2019s human rights abuses.\nIn 2016, the same year he met the Dalai Lama, he also invited the then leader of Tibet's government in exile, Lobsang Sangay, into his congressional office to meet a group of Minnesota high-schoolers.\nMr Walz lent his strong backing to the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which imposed sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials for human rights abuses during the city's democracy protests.\nJeffrey Ngo, a democracy activist now based in the US, has praised Mr Walz's commitment to getting the legislation passed in 2019.\n\"We knocked on every door when the #HKHRDA lacked momentum,\" he wrote on X after Mr Walz was confirmed as the Harris VP choice. \"Only Walz answered his.\" \nMr Ngo praised Mr Walz as \"the sole House Democrat willing to keep co-sponsoring the bill\". Republican Chris Smith was the bill's other sponsor.\nMr Walz's elevation to the Democratic ticket has prompted interest on Chinese social media.\nHe once described his decision to teach in China as \"one of the best things I've ever done\", and there were signs of hope in some of the comments that, if he wins, it may signal better US-China ties.\nOne Weibo user pointed out that Walz's \"unique background gives him a real perspective on China\", and he could \"promote cultural exchanges when... relations are extremely difficult\".\nBut others wondered whether that may be assuming too much.\nThe fact that his teaching posting took place in 1989 - the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing - was not lost on some.\nThe Chinese cannot say much about the massacre for risk of getting censored. They refer to it obliquely - one comment simply said \"if you know, you know\".\nForeigners who were in China at that time \"are the most anti-China\", said another user.\nIndeed, Mr Walz has often spoken publicly about his horror at the crushing of the Tiananmen protests, and in 2009 he co-sponsored a resolution in Congress marking its 20th anniversary.\nHis wife Gwen has said that the events had such an effect on Walz, that he chose 4 June - the day Beijing sent the troops in - as the date of their wedding five years later. She said that \"he wanted to have a date he'll always remember\".\nFor more than two decades after Tiananmen, America's foreign policy was founded on a deep, bipartisan agreement that trade and engagement with China was broadly a good thing.\nIt is no surprise that evidence can be found of Mr Walz expressing views that align with that consensus.\nOn the flip side, Donald Trump's own-brand suits and ties were made in China, and he and his daughter Ivanka registered dozens of trademarks there.\nFar from being pro-China, Mr Walz's record marks him out as someone who has taken a more nuanced view. \nHe has spoken of the need for dialogue and cooperation on issues such as trade and climate change - but remains fiercely critical when it comes to human rights.\nThat stance was in evidence from the very start of the relationship. When returning to Nebraska after his year in China, he told a local newspaper that there were \"no limits\" to what the Chinese could accomplish.\n\"If they had proper leadership,\" he added.",
    "A busy city road will see a series of closures as part of \"major\" improvements and repairs, a council has said. \nThe A6 Abbey Lane, in Leicester, will be resurfaced after a range of improvements Leicester City Council said it had already made. \nSplit into phases, the work is due to begin on Friday and is due to take about two and a half weeks. \nThe authority said the work required a series of closures between Friday and 19 August. \nImprovement work will also include the adjoining Beaumont Leys Lane and Corporation Road. \nThe first phase of resurfacing work will see the stretch of Abbey Lane - between Sudeley Avenue and Orton Road - including its junction with Beaumont Leys Lane -  close to traffic in an outbound direction from Friday to Monday 12 August. \nResurfacing to Beaumont Leys Lane will also start on Friday and will be closed in both directions between Abbey Lane and Parker Drive for up to 10 days, the council said. \nThen, from 15 August until 19 August, Abbey Lane is due to close to traffic in the inbound direction between Wade Street and Chale Road. This closure will include the junction with Corporation Road. \nThe council said once resurfacing work at the main Abbey Lane junction was complete, work would move back on to Beaumont Leys Lane, between Parker Drive and Halifax Drive. During this work, the road will be closed in both directions. \nAll the resurfacing work was expected to be complete by 25 August, and diversions would be signposted in the area, the council said. \nAlong with resurfacing this important junction, improvements include traffic signal renewal, the extension of the existing cycle lane in Beaumont Leys Lane from Wolsey House Primary School to the Abbey Lane junction, and the creation of a new cycle lane in Corporation Road linking to the Riverside path, which leads to Belgrave and the city centre, the council added. \nMartin Fletcher, the authority's director of highways, said: \"Abbey Lane is an important and busy route in and out of the city, and that\u2019s why investment in improving the highway and prolonging the life of the carriageway surface is so important.\n\"We understand that any roadworks cause disruption, but these works are essential to ensure that our roads remain able to handle modern traffic demands for many years to come.\n\"Well-signposted diversions will be in place, but drivers are advised to expect delays and take an alternative route if possible.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Japan has lifted its warning about a potential \u201cmegaquake\u201d, one week after it was issued.\nThe warning told people to be alert but not evacuate, saying the probability of a major earthquake was higher than usual but it was not imminent.\nThe Japanese government said it was no longer asking people to take special precautions and they were free to \u201cgo back to normal lifestyles\u201d.\nFollowing the warning, thousands of Japanese people cancelled planned trips and stocked up on essentials, while some high-speed rail travel was also affected. \nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said, as of Wednesday, it had detected no seismic activity indicating any concerning changes in the presumed area where the megaquake could originate, Kyodo news agency reported.\nWhile last week\u2019s warning has been lifted, the risk of a major earthquake is still present, disaster management minister Yoshifumi Matsumura said.\nHe said no abnormalities had been detected in \u201cseismic activity and crustal deformation\u201d so the call for increased preparedness was lifted at 17:00 local time (09:00 BST).\n\"But it doesn't mean the risk (of a major earthquake) has been eliminated,\" he told reporters.\n\"We have been asking for special precautions, such as sleeping while being prepared to evacuate immediately. But we will no longer ask for these steps, and the people of Japan are free to go back to normal lifestyles,\" he added.\nLast week\u2019s warning came hours after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit off the southern island of Kyushu.\nExperts were put on heightened alert because of where the epicentre sat - at the edge of the Nankai Trough, an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast.\nThe plate boundary sits between Suruga Bay in central Japan, and the Hyuganada Sea in Kyushu to the south.\nAfter last week\u2019s warning, some shops were reportedly left with empty shelves or forced to put limits on purchases of items like bottled water. \nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida cancelled a trip to Central Asia. Some bullet trains also reduced their speed as a precaution.\nPrevious Nankai Trough earthquakes have left thousands dead. These megaquakes have been recorded once every 90 to 200 years, with the last one occurring in 1946.\nExperts say there is a 70% to 80% chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 quake striking somewhere along the trough in the next 30 years, according to the Kyodo news agency. Worst-case estimates suggest more than 200,000 people could be killed in the earthquake and potential subsequent tsunami.",

    "A study of samples taken from inside the bodies of centuries-old coral has revealed the threat climate change now poses to the Great Barrier Reef.\nResearchers in Australia say temperatures in and around the vast coral reef over the past decade are the highest recorded in 400 years.\nExtreme heat has already caused five mass bleaching events in the past nine years alone.\nWriting in the journal Nature, the scientists behind the study say increased temperatures, driven by climate change, now pose an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to this natural wonder of the world.\n\u201cThe science tells us that the Great Barrier Reef is in danger - and we should be guided by the science,\u201d Prof Helen McGregor, from the University of Wollongong, told BBC News.\nThe new evidence comes from within the coral itself.\nOver many years, marine scientists have collected cores - samples drilled out of the skeletons of coral -  which provide chemical clues about how the environment around the reef has changed as the coral developed.\nCoral - which are animals, not plants - can live for centuries, laying down chemical indicators about their natural environment.\nResearchers in Australia re-examined the data from thousands of these cores and cross-referenced them with historical sea temperature records from the UK\u2019s Hadley Centre. \nThe research showed temperatures around the Great Barrier Reef in the previous decade were the warmest of the past 400 years.\n\"The recent events in the Great Barrier Reef are extraordinary,\u201d said lead researcher Dr Benjamin Henley, who carried out the study whilst working at Wollongong University.\n\u201cUnfortunately, this is terrible news for the reef.\"\n\u201cThere is still a glimmer of hope though,\" he added. \"If we can come together and restrict global warming, then there's a glimmer of hope for this reef, and others around the world, to survive in their current state.\u201d\nCorals have adapted to survive and grow within a specific temperature range - forming a skeleton that provides a living habitat for other marine life. \nCorals exist in a symbiotic partnership with a special type of marine plant - a species of algae -  which lives inside the coral, providing it with food and giving it its bright colour.\nBleaching occurs when sea temperatures rise too high and corals expel their algae, subsequently turning white.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a pretty sight,\u201d said Dr Henley. \u201cEventually [other] algae grows on the surface of the white coral, turning it brown.\n\"While bleached coral can recover, if the heat does not relent, it doesn\u2019t have the chance to,\" he explained.\n\u201cI'm a little reluctant to say things are doomed,\u201d said Prof McGregor. \n\"Reefs have survived a lot of change over geological time. So I guess the question comes down to -  what kind of reef do we end up with?\n\u201cIt won't be like what we have now.\u201d\nThe Great Barrier Reef is currently a Unesco World Heritage site. Scientists hope that this research could persuade the UN organisation to change its mind and give the reef official \u201cendangered\u201d status.\nProf McGregor said this \u201cwould send a huge signal to the world about how grave the problem is\u201d.\n\"We know what we need to do,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have international agreements in place [to limit global temperature rise]. \n\"I think we just need to put the politics aside and get on with it.\"",
    "A man who suffered \"horrific\" burns to his body after touching electrical cables carrying 11,000 volts has been reunited with the ambulance staff who helped to save his life.\nOn 24 November 2020, Darren Harris was electrocuted in an abandoned building in Wolverhampton, while attempting to steal scrap metal.\nHe received burns to his face, arms, chest and abdomen, and spent several months receiving specialist treatment at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.\nFour years on, he visited Stoke Ambulance Hub to meet the ambulance crew and  trauma doctor who responded to the 999 call that day.\nRecounting what happened, Mr Harris said: \"During lockdown I was struggling for funds and I went to get illegal scrap metal from buildings that were getting demolished. \n\"Unfortunately, I put my left arm into an 11KV switchboard, which completely melted my forearms down to the bone. \n\"I ran in front of the ambulance on its way to me to flag it down and both faces of the paramedics were as white as a ghost.\"\nMedics said it was rare for people to survive such a surge of electricity through the body. \nMr Harris said he had wanted to thank the ambulance crew ever since the incident, but the timing had not been right.\n\"Sharing my story helps me overcome everything and put it to rest in my head,\" he said.\n\"It\u2019s been very traumatic and very difficult, but I\u2019m on the mend and trying to do good things and good deeds.\n\"I'm very grateful to be here \u2013 and it's all thanks to the paramedics and the surgeons.\"\nMr Harris admitted he should not have been on the site, but had \"paid a price for that\".\n\"I'm not a scumbag, I'm not an idiot.

    "When you last bought a new electronic device did you look at the instruction manual?\nIf your answer is a resounding \u201cno\u201d, then you are not alone.\nStudies show that many of us don\u2019t bother to read the user guide.\nOne UK survey found that one in five of us skips the manual, while a US report said it was as high as 50%.\nCaspar Herzberg, boss of UK industrial software firm Aveva, says he likes a good instruction manual. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of mundane things!\u201d But he understands that many people immediately throw them in a kitchen drawer, never to be read.\nYet while it\u2019s OK for a consumer to skip the user guide, this isn\u2019t the case in the world of industry, where engineers have to know exactly how the machinery or computer system they look after works. This is especially the case if a problem arises that they need to fix as quickly as possible.\nTo help such workers, Aveva has launched an AI system that can read and learn operating manuals on their behalf.\nIn its first incarnation this AI has memorised the technical manuals for the power grids and wind turbines managed by Aveva's parent company Schneider Electric.\nIt also continuously monitors the machinery via thousands of sensors.\nThe idea is that the AI can imitate the expertise of senior engineers with decades of practical know-how behind them.\nSo how can the AI assist an energy sector worker who is trying to hunt down the cause of a fault?\nSimon Bennett, Aveva's head of AI innovation, says the AI can locate where there has been, say, a power failure. It then delves into \"a monster PDF manual\".\nFrom this, the AI - via a computer screen - generates different ideas of what the problem might be.\nIt can also produce a 3D image of the affected machinery, such as a turbine, with Mr Bennett noting that engineers appreciate such visual responses to their questions.\nAveva calls the system its \u201cindustrial AI assistant\u201d, and says the aim is that it will help to compensate for a dilemma facing many businesses \u2013 an ageing workforce that is retiring and taking its hard-earned knowledge with it.\nSo if someone is new to their job, says Mr Herzberg, \"the AI can guide them... and look at the manual for you\".\nOr as Mr Bennett puts it: \"By asking smart questions of the AI system we won\u2019t have to wake up some old, retired engineer in the night and keep him on the phone for an hour.\"\nWhile Aveva has made an AI system that can search through instruction manuals, other technology companies have created AI that can make such product guides in the first place.\nCalifornia-based tech firm Dozuki is one such firm. Its AI-powered system CreatorPro can automatically create a user guide based on an engineer making a video of him or her talking through and carrying out a process.\n\u201cThe user uploads the video, and a step-by-step instruction guide is automatically created,\u201d says Allen Yeung, Dozuki\u2019s vice president of product. \u201cThe AI chooses the text that accompanies each step, and it can automatically translate that into other languages.\u201d\nCurrently the AI produces video clips accompanied by text for other workers to read. Mr Yeung says that they are working to extend the text to speech, with the AI in the future also dictating the instructions via a computer speaker.\nThe AI-created user guides still, however, need to get signed off by a human being. \u201cThe user guides are exported in a draft state for an engineer to review,\u201d says Mr Yeung.\nEchoing points made by Aveva, Mr Yeung adds that Dozuki\u2019s product aims to help firms cope with the fact that manufacturing sector workforces are getting older, with more elderly staff retiring.\nSCG Chemicals, a Thai petrochemicals company that is now due to start using Aveva\u2019s AI, says it is being impacted by an ageing workforce.\n\u201cYounger engineers go to an expert when they have a problem, but many of our experienced people are retiring in the next five years,\u201d says divisional director Warit Krittaphol. \u201cWe cannot build a pipeline of experts. We have over 14 million documents in our system. AI will be able to grab the right information fast.\u201d\nBack in California, Scribe is another tech firm that allows companies to automatically create AI user guides. In Scribe's case the AI makes the manuals from what a user has done on his or her computer.\n\"The way the technology works at a simple level\u2026 you click the record button, and you do a process you would have normally done anyway, the way you would normally do it,\" says Scribe chief executive Jennifer Smith. \n\"And then when you've done doing your work you hit stop record and it will automatically generate a step-by-step written guide with screen shots, instructions, titles etc, showing how to do that process.\n\"You as an individual have a whole bunch of control over how you can edit it, add lots of content, but the point is you don\u2019t have to. All the information that someone would need to do that same process is automatically contained in that step-by-step guide.\"\nStuart Duff, a UK business psychologist who describes his ",
    "More than a week ago, violence erupted in communities across England with mobs attacking police, burning cars and buildings and looting businesses. While some involved have been jailed and many more await prosecution, the BBC spoke to a couple of those picking up the pieces in the aftermath.\nIt had started as a quiet Sunday afternoon in the South Yorkshire suburb of Manvers. \nThen, as resident Caroline Bradley recalls, the \"lynch mob\" descended on the streets of well-kept, newly built homes in Wath upon Dearne, near Rotherham.\nTheir target was a Holiday Inn, which for several years has housed asylum seekers and refugees.\nA week on, the damage left behind is clear to see.\nAn electricity box at the back of the car park has been burnt to a crisp while cracked windows remain visible, with several of them boarded up. \nThe atmosphere is distinctly eerie, the quiet profound after the noise before.\n\"They were a very hate-filled mob just looking out for trouble,\" Ms Bradley, who has lived near the hotel with her husband Stuart and their teenage son for five years, says.\nMs Bradley says she and other local residents were initially against migrants being housed at the hotel without consultation.\nHowever, she says \"they have been here a couple of years and I don\u2019t know of any trouble\".\n\"I appreciate people have got opinions, but it was next-level hate,\" she says, adding: \"It was difficult to pinpoint what the agendas were, other than just destruction and hate.\"\nShe says the majority of the rioters she saw did not live in the area, adding: \"They don't speak for us as a community.\"\nThe very next day, people were out in force to start cleaning up the mess.\nAmong them was Jade Wade, who had spent the previous day watching in horror as the chaos streamed on social media.\n\"I'm just really disheartened, shocked and angry,\" she says.\nThe violent protests, which struck towns and cities across the country, came in the aftermath of the deaths of three girls in Southport on 29 July, who were killed while attending a Taylor Swift-themed dance event.\nThe mobs \"jumped on a bandwagon and saw a reason to get angry\", Jade says, adding: \"They said they were protecting our children, when there were poor children in [the hotel] as well. \n\"It just doesn't make any sense.\n\"A lot of them didn't know why they were here. They just saw it as a reason to come along and cause violence.\n\"All we can do is just continue to stand together and not back down to them.\"\nIt is a sentiment shared 96 miles (164km) north in the Teesside town of Hartlepool.\nFive days before the Manvers riot, Nancy Pout could only watch helplessly as protesters ran riot across her town.\nThe Salaam Centre, which provides groups and support for those in the local community facing a number of issues and which Ms Pout is the manager of, was one of those caught in the crossfire of bricks and bottles.\n\"What I saw was senseless acts of violence and damage,\" she says, adding: \"It was horrible.\"\nBut people like her were galvanised in the aftermath.\n\"It made us feel even more passionate about supporting our community and we stood together with our neighbours, with my colleagues and with the amazing men and women of Cleveland Police and said 'no, this is not our town',\" Ms Pout adds.\nA large group had gathered by 09:00 BST the morning after to start the clean up, with volunteers being helped on with teas and coffees from other members of the community.\n\"It was a shining light out of what had been a horrible night within the community, but it really shows that the majority in Hartlepool want what's best for this town, unlike the minority that were there on [31 July].\n\"The town pulled together, we had hundreds of people attend to try and make up for the horrible scenes of the previous night and that support has continued throughout the weeks.\n\"So our doors are open and we are business as usual.\"",

    "A motorway project to help tackle city congestion is still going ahead despite uncertainty.\nPolitical leaders in the west of England planned to carry out an 'M32 project' in Bristol, but what it would include has been unclear.\nLast week a suggested park and ride scheme by the motorway was dropped after transport planners feared it would have pushed drivers to use residential roads in areas such as Fishponds or Frenchay.\nPressed on whether it still included building a park and ride, the West of England Combined Authority (WECA) said it \u201cremained fully committed to tackling congestion\u201d.\nStephen Peacock, WECA chief executive, said the M32 sustainable transport project had \"not been scrapped\". \n\"Put simply, the original plan, because of the nature and scope of it, would not have passed the [Department for Transport] value for money test, so it was clearly not going to work as it was,\" he said.\n\u201cThe scope of that piece of work has now been broadened, so it\u2019s a broader geographical area, and it will look into things like travel behaviour, not just along the M32 but around it, including making sure that if we make it harder for people to get onto the M32, we don\u2019t make it as easy for them to take alternative routes.\n\u201cBecause that clearly would not help congestion or air quality.\"\nA park and ride plan at the M32 has been discussed for many years, the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said.\nUnder the initial proposal, a park and ride would have been built at the M32's junction 1 on the outskirts of Bristol, as well as new bus lanes.\nHowever traffic modelling suggested drivers would instead use residential roads as alternative routes, if there was less space on the motorway.\nThis would make residential areas more polluted and could slow down some bus routes, according to the authority.\nThe LDRS said the authority did not mention a park and ride when asked if the project still includes one after the meeting.\nA spokesman for the combined authority said: \u201cWe are continuing work to progress with the M32 sustainable transport corridor project. \n\"Last week the mayor and members of the combined authority committee approved the revised milestones and funding allocations for this important project, and we expect an outline business case will be submitted early next year.\n\u201cWe remain fully committed to addressing the challenges relating to congestion, which causes both noise and air pollution, affecting local residential areas and those using the M32.\u201d\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A $4 billion (\u00a33.1 billion) settlement has been announced for claims from more than two thousand people seeking compensation over last year's deadly wildfires on Maui, Hawaii's governor has said.\nJosh Green's office confirmed a deal in principle had been proposed to resolve around 450 legal cases.\nThe August 2023 wildfires were the deadliest in modern US history, killing more than 100 people and destroying the historic town of Lahaina.  \nA term sheet, seen by the BBC, said a $4.037 billion agreement had been proposed which \"must fully resolve all Maui fires claims\". \nThe settlement, which Mr Green said was reached after four months of negotiation, will be paid by the seven defendants named in lawsuits lodged in the wake of the fires.\nThese are the State of Hawaii, County of Maui, Hawaiian Electric, Kamehameha Schools, West Maui Land Co, Hawaiian Telcom and Spectrum/Charter Communications.\nHawaiian Electric has confirmed it will contribute nearly $2 billion, a little under half of the total settlement deal.\nThe hundreds of legal cases had been launched by individuals, businesses, and insurance companies in state and federal courts, Mr Green said. Approximately 2,200 affected parties had filed lawsuits, he added.\nHis statement made clear it is currently still an agreement in principle and requires final court and legislative approval.\n\"The agreement is conditional on the resolution of the insurance companies\u2019 claims that have already been paid for property loss and other damages, with no additional payments from the defendants,\" it added.\nMr Green said the deal \"will help our people heal\", adding it was his priority to \"avoid protracted and painful lawsuits\" to allow the recovery process to begin as soon as possible.\n\"Settling a matter like this within a year is unprecedented, and it will be good that our people don\u2019t have to wait to rebuild their lives as long as others have in many places that have suffered similar tragedies.\"\nOnce a final settlement is agreed it must also be approved by Hawaii's state legislature, Mr Green said. Payments are expected to begin by mid-2025, he added.",
    "People buying a house for the first time are spending about 37% of their take-home pay on mortgage payments, according to the Nationwide.\nThe figure is well above the long-term average of 30%, the building society said, making it tougher for new buyers to afford a house.\nHouse price growth picked up in the year to July as wages rose, it added.\nPrices increased by 2.1% over the year, the fastest pace since December 2022.\nSome people were feeling more confident about getting a mortgage as their pay packets went up, Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said.\nBut relatively high mortgage rates and affordability issues also acted as a brake for prospective buyers.\nThe typical monthly mortgage payment remained \"quite high\", Mr Gardner said, especially compared with the 28% of their income first-time buyers were spending before the Covid pandemic.\nIt meant fewer people were able to afford properties, he said, especially as the amount of deposit needed was \"high by historical standards\".\nThe average price of a house rose to \u00a3266,334 last month. However, prices are still below the all-time highs recorded in the summer of 2022.\nPart of the reason for the jump in prices was weak growth at the same time last year, Mr Gardner said, but added that people were also feeling more confident as their wages rise in real terms.\nAlthough pay growth has been slowing, it is still outpacing rising prices.\nThe speed of pay growth was one of the economic factors the Bank of England would have considered at its interest rates meeting on Thursday, when it chose to cut rates to 5%.\nRates had been at 5.25% - the highest level for 16 years - which pushed up repayments for people with tracker mortgages, and borrowing costs for those trying to secure or renew mortgage deals.\nHigher mortgage rates have been part of the reason many people have struggled to afford to buy a home.\nOne of the main reasons house prices are so high in the UK relative to wages is that \"supply of housing has not caught up with demand for quite a while\", Mr Gardner said, which has also had a knock-on impact on pushing rental prices up.\nThe new government has pledged to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, in part by overhauling the planning system, and letting developers build on some greenbelt land.\nNationwide, one of the biggest mortgage lenders in the UK, bases its figures on house prices on its own lending.\nThe statistics do not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.\nThe Bank of England's base rate informs what High Street lenders set mortgage rates at. \nAlice Haine, personal finance analyst at Evelyn Partners, said Thursday's rate cut \"could add serious momentum to the market if buyers and sellers who have been waiting patiently in the wings for borrowing conditions to improve are now spurred into action\".",
    "Seven people are being sought by police after objects were hurled outside a hotel housing asylum seekers during a protest in Aldershot.\nA minority of the 200 who protested outside the Potters International Hotel became involved in the disruption on Wednesday evening, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary said. \nThe force has released images of seven people it would like to identify.\nThe protest follows multiple pockets of unrest across the country after three girls were killed in the Merseyside town of Southport on Monday.\nBebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar were fatally stabbed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, appeared in court charged with three counts of murder and 10 counts of attempted murder, after eight other children and two adults were seriously injured.\nIn Aldershot, a demonstration descended into a \"mob-type\" protest, according to Hampshire police and crime commissioner (PCC) Donna Jones. One police officer suffered a minor injury.\nAppealing for witnesses, a Hampshire police spokesman said: \"Investigations are under way today to take action against those who sparked disruption in Aldershot last night.\"\nHe said \"the majority of attendees gathered in a peaceful manner\" but a minority \"got involved in criminal activity, throwing objects and subjecting people to racial abuse\".\nPolice have not directly linked the disruption in Aldershot to the Southport attack.\nAlex Baker, Labour MP for Aldershot, said the situation had been \"exacerbated\" by people from outside the community.\n\"There is no justification for disorderly behaviour and these scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough,\" she posted on X.\n\"We all support our shared right to peacefully protest, but we will not stand for people coming to our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide our community.\"\nReligious leaders have also called for calm and said they \"deplore\" the way a minority of people have behaved. \nImam Monawar Hussein, of the Oxfordshire Faith, Civic and Community Leaders Group, urged people to be cautious when promoting information online.\nHe said: \"When you see anything on social media please verify it before you go and re-share it.\"\nHe also encouraged people to support police and allow them to do their work.\n\"It's been terrible to see the images of the violence done against our police force.\" he added.\nAnyone with information on the seven people pictured by Hampshire Police have been urged to contact the force online or call 101, quoting the reference number 44240326041.\nSeparately, seven men have been charged after disorder broke out in Hartlepool on Wednesday, Cleveland Police said. Officers were attacked with missiles, glass bottles and eggs in Hartlepool's Murray Street area.\nAn 11-year-old boy was also arrested on suspicion of arson after a police car was set alight in Hartlepool.\nMore than 100 people were arrested in central London on Wednesday as officers clashed with protesters on Whitehall during a demonstration.\nThere was also unrest in Southport on Tuesday, which came hours after a peaceful vigil was attended by thousands to remember the girls who died.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"action will be taken\" following the \"violent disorder\" at a meeting with police chiefs at Downing Street.\nSpeaking in a televised speech afterwards, he laid out plans for forces across the country to increase their co-operation to tackle such incidents.",
    "A council has begun negotiations to buy a shopping precinct in a major step towards taking the site into public ownership.\nMike Stonard, leader of Norwich City Council, said the authority had formally expressed an interest in acquiring Anglia Square from its current owners, Columbia Threadneedle.\nThe complex is up for sale for \u00a38.5m. \nDevelopers Weston Homes pulled out of a redevelopment scheme in February despite spending eight years on its plans, which would have included 1,100 homes, shops and leisure space.\nIt said the revamp was no longer financially viable.\nCity Hall\u00a0has agreed\u00a0to spend \u00a3300,000, taken from reserves, to carry out assessments and put together a business case for buying the\u00a0complex.\nThe council\u2019s cabinet agreed to launch a bid to take\u00a0the site into public ownership at a meeting last month, but it needs to get a commitment of millions of pounds from the new government\u00a0if any deal is to go ahead, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nMr Stonard said: \u201cWe are looking to buy the site so we can shape the future of Anglia Square in the interests of local people.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been really clear that we don\u2019t want to see Anglia Square bought out by land speculators who will either just sit on the land or develop it out in bits.\n\u201cWe want to create a new Anglia\u00a0Square featuring truly affordable homes, an eclectic mix of retail and leisure outlets and well-paid jobs for local people.\u201d\nThe council will also need to find a partner prepared to join forces to redevelop the site.\nWeston Homes\u00a0secured permission for the redevelopment\u00a0of Anglia Square last spring after years of public inquiries and legal battles, but it pulled out saying a decision by the then government to overturn local planning consent and nutrient neutrality rules had pushed up costs.\nCity Hall said it was hoping to make its final offer to Columbia Threadneedle in the autumn.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The transport secretary has voiced \"serious concerns\" about rail operator CrossCountry and threatened to take action if things do not improve.\nIn a scathing letter to the train company's interim directors on Friday, Louise Haigh said she \u201creluctantly\u201d approved its request to temporarily cut down on services.\nCrossCountry has said the timetable reduction is necessary to address a backlog of training required by drivers, something it said had been worsened by recent industrial action.\nIn a statement, the operator acknowledged its poor service and apologised for the inconvenience of the new timetable, saying it would lead to a more resilient service.\nThe operator announced the slimmed-down timetable, due to run for three months, from 10 August to 9 November, in July.\nIn her criticisms of CrossCountry, Ms Haigh said passengers had been \"suffering from a substandard service for too long\".\n\"Over the past year, the level of train cancellations across your company has increased significantly and by your own forecasts, you expected to breach your contractual targets for cancellations in the coming months,\" she said.\nMs Haigh said this was unacceptable and that the temporary reduced timetable was  not a satisfactory response. \n\"Put simply, the only reason I accepted your proposal was to give passengers more certainty on which services will run,\" Ms Haigh said.\nThe transport secretary said CrossCountry had been put on a remedial plan to formally ensure the rail operator was working to improving services, while barring the company from profiting off running fewer services.\n\"If you fail to deliver the Remedial Plan, I will not hesitate to take further action,\" Ms Haigh said.\nIn a statement, CrossCountry acknowledged that service had \"fallen below the standards our passengers should expect from us\". \n\"All too frequently, our passengers have been inconvenienced by on-the-day cancellations, which results in poor quality and reliability of service,\" it said.\nCrossCountry apologised for the inconvenience the temporary timetable would cause, and said redeployed trains would ensure \"97% of our normal daily number of seats\" would continue to operate.\n\"By the end of the temporary timetable, we will have more fully-trained drivers who can work across the network,\" the statement said.\nThe CrossCountry network spans major cities across England and into Scotland.\nThe operator's services connect most of the UK's biggest cities, including Birmingham, Edinburgh, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Newcastle and Manchester.\nThe Labour government has vowed to renationalise nearly all passenger rail services as existing private contracts expire.\nIt introduced the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Bill within its first month in office, before MPs left Parliament for the summer recess.\nCrossCountry\u2019s contract, agreed by the previous Conservative government, began in October last year and is due to expire on 12 October 2031.",
    "Eluned Morgan has officially become the new first minister of Wales, making her the first woman to lead the nation.\nShe was confirmed as the new leader of Welsh Labour in July, following Vaughan Gething's resignation. \nShe won the support of almost all of Labour's politicians in the Welsh Parliament.\nMs Morgan said she hoped to \u201cadd my own distinctive contribution to this legacy\u201d, adding: \u201cPerhaps with a vibrant splash of colour. The grey suits are out.\u201d\nMs Morgan's journey to become first minister is the culmination of a political career that started young and has taken her to three parliaments.\nShe has previously referred to herself as a \"bit of a disruptor\", but she has been a politician almost her whole working life.\nShe had a political upbringing in Ely, Cardiff. Her father, Bob, was a vicar who led South Glamorgan council. Her mother, Elaine, was a councillor too.\nTheir home \"was the headquarters for political activity in the west of Cardiff\", she once said.\nFuture first ministers Rhodri Morgan and Mark Drakeford were part of their political circle.\nShe was educated at Cardiff's Ysgol Glantaf and, with a scholarship, at the independent Atlantic College in the Vale of Glamorgan.\nAfter university in Hull she worked in television before becoming the youngest member of the European Parliament when elected to it, aged 27, in 1994.\nHer ministerial biography says she was only the fifth full-time female politician from Wales - and the first from Wales to have a baby while in office.\nAfter standing down as an MEP in 2009 she went to work for the energy company SSE.\nGranted a peerage in 2011, she went to the House of Lords where, as Baroness Morgan of Ely, she was a shadow minister for Wales.\nIn 2016 she swapped Westminster's parliament for the parliament in Cardiff Bay, then still called the assembly, getting elected for the Mid and West Wales region.\nHer first leadership bid only got off the ground because outgoing first minister Carwyn Jones lent her a nomination.\nMorgan came last behind eventual winner Drakeford and second-placed Gething.\nDrakeford appointed her to his government, before elevating her to the toughest job in the cabinet - health minister - in 2021.\nShe inherited the devastating legacy of Covid and soaring waiting times.\nHer time in the job has seen industrial action and an acrimonious decision to put north Wales's underperforming health board back into special measures.\nRunning the NHS on a tight budget would be \"hell on earth\", she said in 2022.\nIt was a characteristically blunt assessment from someone who is known to speak her mind.\nThe Covid inquiry revealed how she texted colleagues about the Omicron variant, declaring: \"We're all f*****d!\"\nShe apologised for the fruity language saying, it's \"probably not what you want\" from the daughter of a vicar whose husband, Rhys Jenkins, is a priest too. He is also a GP, and they have two children.\nThere was another apology in June 2022 when she was banned from driving for six months for repeatedly speeding. And she apologised again the following year for a joke about the late Margaret Thatcher and a Conservative reshuffle.\nHaving gone for the top job once, she might have been expected to enter the contest to succeed Drakeford. But she backed her former rival Gething instead.\nAsked if she hoped a new first minister would keep her in the health job at the time, she told ITV Wales: \"Not necessarily. It's a very, very tough job I must say.\"\nDespite the hint that she fancied a change, Gething retained her as health secretary - and she defended him when he came under pressure as leader.\nMs Morgan officially became first minister after being installed by the Senedd at a special meeting on Tuesday.\nBeing first minister and unifying Welsh Labour after a torrid few months will be an even more difficult task than the one she leaves behind.",
    "A lingering fragrance of bun maska (bread and butter), plates loaded with freshly cooked samosas and cups of piping hot and creamy Irani chai.\nThese are some of the sights you would typically find at a Persian-style cafe in India.\nPopularly known as Irani cafes, these iconic restaurants - with their signature marble-topped tables, old-style clocks, chequered floors and a distinctive menu - have been a part of India's culture for more than 100 years.\nAnd their influence has spread beyond India: Dishoom, one of London's most recognisable restaurant chains, was inspired by these cafes.\nThey came up in cities like Mumbai and Pune in the 18th and 19th centuries when there was an influx of Persian immigrants from Iran.\nThere's a third lesser known pocket of the country - the southern city of Hyderabad - where these cafes have been an intrinsic part of the local culture for decades.\nBut despite their many charms and the rich cultural heritage, the cafes of this city - like their counterparts in Pune and Mumbai - are on the verge of dying out, with owners blaming rising prices, competition from fast-food restaurants and changing consumer tastes.\nHyderabad has the highest number of Irani cafes after Mumbai even today.  That's because the city was a centre for Iranian trade in the late 19th Century.\nPersian was widely spoken under the rule of a Muslim Nizam, or prince. The Niloufer caf\u00e9, located in the old quarters of the city, was actually named after the Nizam's daughter-in-law, an Ottoman princess.\nThis was also a period when parts of modern-day Pakistan were still in India, with Iran as its neighbour, making the country easily accessible to Persian traders.\nMost of the families who moved to Hyderabad - and other Indian cities - came to escape persecution and famine back home. Some came in search of better jobs and business.\nTheir arrival coincided with colonial rule when the British were actively promoting a tea drinking culture in the country.\nWhen the Iranians arrived, they brought their own style of making tea giving rise to a distinct Iranian chai culture in the cities.\nIn Iran, people would drink it without milk, consuming it with a sugar cube in the mouth. Indians, however, would add milk and cream to the tea for taste.\n\"At first, the tea was sold under the name Chai Khana and only Muslims drank it,\" Hyderabad-based historian Mohammed Safiullah says. \"But soon, people from all religions caught on to its distinct flavour.\"\nBy the 20th Century, Irani cafes were present in every nook and corner of Hyderabad.\nThe customers would sip on the lip-smacking tea as they would spend hours chatting away at the coffee shops.\nAt some cafes, patrons would also be able to play their favourite songs on a jukebox for a small fee.\nHistorians say these cafes played a crucial role in breaking down social barriers and religious taboos and became an important part of the city's public life.\n\"Irani cafes in Hyderabad have stood as symbols of secularism,\" historian Paravastu Lokeshwar said. \"The names didn't have any religious connotations. People of all religions and castes patronised them.\"\nNow they are under threat.\nFrom an estimated 450 cafes over two decades ago, Hyderabad now has only 125 left, said Jaleel Farooq Rooz, owner of The Grand Hotel, a famous Irani cafe. \nMr Rooz's maternal grandfather came from Iran in 1951 and took over the hotel that was started by 12 Iranians in 1935.\n\"We used to sell 8,000-9,000 cups a day once. Now we sell just 4,000 cups a day,\" he told the BBC.\nHe cites competition from fast-food chains as one of the reasons. Now one of the most rapidly developing Indian cities, Hyderabad was a quiet little town until the early 1990s. Things changed in the mid-90s, when the city joined the IT boom in India and became a powerhouse of the industry.\nThe transformation was accompanied by a slew of economic reforms in the country, which allowed global fast-food chains and cafes to penetrate the Indian market. Similar to Iranian cafes, these food joints also offered extended seating options, but with far better amenities and more options.\nMr Rooz said most Irani cafes operated from rented premises as they required large spaces where patrons could relax and unwind over tea.\nBut rising real estate prices in Hyderabad have forced many owners to move to other work.\n\"Inflation also took a toll. Tea powder and milk prices have risen three times compared to five years ago,\" he added.\nOthers say the number of Iranian families entering the business has also gone down.\n\"The current generation is not interested in the caf\u00e9 and restaurant business. They prefer other jobs and many migrate to other countries,\" said the owner of popular Farasha Restaurant, Mahmood, who goes by only one name.\nBut despite the challenges, there are still a few in the business who continue to swim against the tide.\nSyed Mohammed Razak manages the Red Rose Restaurant in Hyderabad. His grandfather migrated from Tehran and established the City Light H",
    "\"Undeniable\". \nThat's the word gymnast David Martelli chooses to describe Olympian Rhys McClenaghan's training mentality. \n\"He uses that word a lot,\" Mr Martelli says.\n\"We see the good days and the bad days but every time we see him do a routine, he's always locked in and ready to go, there is never a flicker of doubt.\"\nOn Saturday, McClenaghan's years of training will come to the fore when he attempts to win an Olympic medal in the pommel horse final.\nMr Martelli has known McClenaghan since he was five and has trained with him ever since.\nMcClenaghan missed out on a medal in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics after a mistake during his routine but he will aim to put that right later on Saturday.\n\"It's 17 years minimum of hard work. If anything, it's going to inspire him either way,\" Mr Martelli says.\n\"If he wins gold, he's going to want more. If he doesn't get gold, he's going to want more.\n\"Either way, all I see is positivity really.\"\nMr Martelli says that any gymnast is \"not necessarily motivated every day\" but that is when discipline is crucial.\n\"You have to be obsessed. You can't be kind of in it. You have to be 100% into gymnastics in order to succeed at the level Rhys has,\" he says.\n\"Gymnastics is very niche in Northern Ireland, there's not a lot of high level gymnasts so we are lucky to have someone like Rhys\".\nMr Martelli says it's inspiring for everyone including younger gymnasts at the club.\n\"It's nice for them to have someone to aspire to be like every single day in training and train alongside as well which is also very cool,\" he says.\nFor those youngsters, Mr Martelli's one piece of advice is to never give up.\n\"Work as hard as you can, stay dedicated and that's it,\" he says.\n\"There's no secret recipe, really. Enjoy it as well, don't be afraid to have fun in your training sessions\".\nTen-year-old Brodie is one of those young gymnasts who have been inspired by McClenaghan.\nHe and his sister Tabby, who is eight both plan to watch the final and cheer McClenaghan on.\nBrodie says the Olympian inspires him \"by doing really good apparatus work, conditioning and stretching\".\nHe says he feels \"pretty confident\" that he will also get to the Olympics one day too. \nWith the younger talent coming through, it's looking like McClenaghan might have some tough competition on his hands some time soon.\nBut later on Saturday it's all about the Newtownards man as he goes for gold.",
    "Protests in holidaying hotspots across Europe have been triggered by tensions over mass tourism, with locals claiming overwhelming numbers of visitors are harming their way of life.\nBut climate change means more visitors are expected to escape rising temperatures on the continent and instead head towards cooler climes for trips away.\nChanging global temperatures are having an impact on Wales' tourism industry, for example, with a recent European Commission study showing a potential rise in global heat of 3-4C could see a 16% increase in visitors to west Wales.\nBut following protests by residents in places like Barcelona, Majorca and Venice in response to \"over-tourism\", could places like Wales be at risk of becoming overwhelmed too?\nLinda Osti, a senior lecturer in tourism management at Bangor University, said Wales could indeed experience \"over-tourism\" if visitor numbers continue to grow.\nBut she said the key to avoiding conflict with locals is to find solutions which benefit both people living in areas and the people visiting them.\n\"There is no sustainable or regenerative tourism without host communities,\" she added.\n\"We need to create co-operation and make sure that tourism is profiting every member of the community.\"\nMs Osti said that the term \"over-tourism\" was first coined by a journalist discussing Iceland in 2016.\n\"International tourism arrived in Iceland and what he noticed was there was a resentment of local people against tourism - so hopefully Wales would be acting before we get to that point,\" she said.\n\"There is also a trust that needs to be rebuilt - we've arrived to a point where there is no more trust in the government and therefore trust needs to be created, and finally tolerance. Tolerance between all of the stakeholders.\"\nEven before global temperatures rise further, Welsh businesses have already noticed more overseas visitors - with Visit Wales saying the number of holidaymakers from Germany doubled between 2022 and 2023.\nAnd the number of cruise ships coming to Wales has risen to 97 this year - 25% up on last year.\nTourists visiting the north of Wales this summer included families from France who said they wanted to escape the heat back home.\nFabian Bars, who had travelled from Paris with wife Amelie and their children to Ogwen Valley in Eryri, said: \"We prefer this temperature. In Paris it's too hot in summer.\"\nMrs Bars said: \"Before coming we were afraid of having rain during our holidays, but it\u2019s nice and it's not hot - it's perfect.\"\nElisabeth and Benjamin Veloppe visited Dolgarrog in Conwy from their home near Nantes with their children Wilhelmina and Aziraphale, and said extreme heat elsewhere was a factor in their decision.\nMr Veloppe said: \"With children it's very important because the night is too hot, we can't walk easily in the afternoon - it's really hard.\"\nMrs Veloppe said: \"In north Wales you have a lot of beautiful places, you can have walks, and you've got little parks for kids.\"\nPhil Scott from Ribride - a tour boat company on the Menai Strait between Anglesey and mainland Wales - said while summer is always busy it would be better to attract people outside peak times or the so-called \"shoulder season\" between the summer months and the winter.\nHe said: \"We need the numbers of people in those shoulder seasons and older couples that aren't bringing children with them.\n\"They're a different type of visitor, their demographics are different, their spend is different and their needs are different.\"\nAnna Hume, who grew up on Anglesey and works at Ribride in the summer, agreed that a longer season would create employment.\n\"It's great to have a summer job in tourism or hospitality, but there's nothing to keep young people here all year round,\" she said.\n\"There's not enough jobs to support young people, then we kind of end up moving away and can't afford to buy houses here because there's not enough income.\"\nFrustrations about visitor numbers have already been felt recently, albeit on a smaller scale, after the popularity of Anglesey\u2019s Llanddwyn Beach - helped by it being featured in HBO's House of the Dragon - led to anger over traffic congestion.\nNeville Evans, the area's councillor with responsibility for leisure, tourism and maritime, said visitors should be pointed to places off the beaten track.\n\"Some of the more internal areas are not touched, so maybe it's a question of trying to move the pressure away from some of the hotspots and concentrating more on communities that do not benefit without actually having an adverse effect on those communities as well.\"",
    "A man who \"barrelled into\" a police officer during a night of protests has pleaded guilty to assault. \nRyan Wheatley, 40, was one of two men arrested in Southampton on Wednesday as he took part in an anti-immigration protest, which was outnumbered by up to 400 people who gathered and chanted \"racists go home\".\nWheatley, of Malvern Close, Fair Oak, admitted at Southampton Magistrates' Court to a charge of assault by beating. \nHe was remanded in custody to be sentenced at Southampton Crown Court on Monday.\nLeah Dillon, prosecuting, told the court the defendant had attended the protest wearing a mask and a hooded top with an England flag draped over his shoulders.\nShe described how he had been spotted by Sgt Rob Perry attempting to run at the counter-demonstrators who had no police protection at the time.\n\"He went towards them, he was running towards them, this was perceived as an attempt to engage them in violence,\" she said.\nMs Dillon said \"he ran straight into\" Sgt Perry who used an incapacitant spray before arresting him.\nWheatley accepted in an interview that he had \"barrelled into the officer\", the court was told. \nThe prosecutor read a statement from Sgt Perry in which he said: \"I was very concerned about his intention should he be given the chance to interact with the group.\"\nSgt Perry described the defendant as a \"very large male\" and recalled that he sprayed him \"because of the sheer size of him - I felt it was the safest way to control him\".\nBarry Keel, defending, said Wheatley had expressed remorse for his actions and accepted he had \"let his family down\".\nHe added the defendant had a history of drug problems.\nMr Keel told the court Wheatley read about the protest on Reddit, and his concern was \"about illegal immigration rather than immigration per se\".\nHe said the defendant had been given the England flag by another protester and had left the other demonstration because \"he was concerned and upset about being called a racist or a Nazi\".\nThe demonstration in Southampton on Wednesday followed a week of disturbances in parts of England and Northern Ireland after the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport - with unrest fuelled by misinformation online.\nPolice have said the majority who attended the protest in Southampton were \"peaceful and respectful\".\nA second man, aged 18 from Eastleigh, was arrested on suspicion of attempting to cause criminal damage at Southampton and has since been released on bail pending further police inquiries.\nA 17-year-old arrested on suspicion of wilfully obstructing the highway at a protest in Portsmouth on Wednesday has also been released on bail\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A woman with breathing and mobility problems has been unable to use electric lights in her south London council flat for three months, following a leak.\nKaren Scott said she had relied on candles and battery-operated lights in her Kennington home since council contractors partially disconnected her electricity for safety reasons.\nShe said she complained to Lambeth Council about the leak and its impact on her health.\nThe authority apologised and said Ms Scott will be given temporary alternative accommodation while the issue is investigated.\nMs Scott, who has asthma and uses a walking frame, said the leak was causing mould on her ceiling, and toilet blockages have led to her having to use facilities elsewhere.\n\"For one year and two months I haven't been able to use the loo. \n\"Unfortunately I have to go to McDonalds or wait for the Oasis Hub (community centre) to open if I need a number two,\" she said.\nMs Scott said despite repeated appeals for help, Lambeth Council has so far failed to fix the problems or rehouse her.\n\"They say they will come, sometimes they turn up, sometimes they don't,\" she said, and added she even cancelled hospital appointments to wait at home for workmen who never arrived.\nShe argued the issues also worsened her already fragile health and said she had been diagnosed with a stress-related condition. \nThe Salvation Army supported Ms Scott in her complaints and in a letter to Lambeth Council it urgently requested \"immediate intervention\" due to the \"perilous and inadequate conditions of her current residence\". \nIt continued by saying Ms Scott's \"current living situation is dire and poses significant risks to her health and well-being\".\nA spokesperson for Lambeth Council said: \"Our service fell below our normal high standards in this case and we apologise to Ms Scott for the inconvenience and frustration this has caused.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard to fix this problem since it was reported to us but, unfortunately, it has been a complicated repair.\n\"Our contractors tried to fix the toilet and electrical issues this week, but found there was a leak affecting a number of properties.\" \nThey added: \"Ms Scott will now be moved temporarily while we investigate and resolve this leak, to limit the inconvenience to her. \n\"Our team will also carry out mould washes on all affected properties.\"\nMs Scott told BBC London she is relieved to know she will be moved temporarily, but is still angry about what she has had to endure.\n\"For me to be using candles - I have to be buying eight, 12 candles a week.\n\"To survive for 13 weeks, and for them to treat me like this, it's just absurd. \n\"I just don't get it, I don't understand it.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "It could be a scene from science fiction. Towering over dark, mossy lava fields are stacks of noisy machines the size of shipping containers, domes, and zig-zagging silver pipes.\nFound 30km (19 miles) southwest of Iceland\u2019s capital Reykjavik, this is the world\u2019s largest direct air capture (DAC) facility.\nCalled Mammoth, it has been developed by Swiss firm Climeworks.\nIt has been running for two months, sucking global-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the air, then storing it deep underground where it turns to stone.\nTwelve collector containers are now installed, but in the coming months 72 of them will circle the large processing hall.\n\u201cThat will enable us to capture 36,000 tons of CO2 every year,\u201d Climeworks\u2019 chief commercial officer, Douglas Chan, tells the BBC.\nThe idea is to reverse emissions that have already been pumped into the atmosphere.\nEach collector unit has a dozen powerful fans, which, every 40 seconds, can suck up enough air to fill an Olympic swimming pool. \n\u201cThe technology relies on sucking in lots and lots of air, slowing it down so that the filter can capture it, and then venting the air back out the end,\u201d says Mr Chan.\nCO2 only makes up a tiny proportion of the atmosphere (0.04%), so capturing it requires a lot of electricity. \nFor Mammoth that electricity comes from a neighbouring geothermal power plant, so, while operating, the plant is emissions free.\nOnce full, the collection chambers are flushed out with hot steam, which is piped into the processing hall. \nInside the hall, Mr Chan points out two enormous balloons overhead, which together hold a single tonne of CO2.\nThat captured CO2 is then mixed with fresh water, in an adjacent tower.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a shower,\u201d explains Dr Martin Voigt, from Icelandic firm Carbfix, which has developed a process to turn CO2 into stone.\n\u201cFrom the top, water trickles down. The CO2 is coming up, and we dissolve the CO2.\u201d\nHidden inside two white, igloo-like domes nearby are injection wells, where the CO2-laden water is pumped more than 700m underground.\n\u201cThis is a fresh basalt here,\u201d says Dr Voight, showing me a lump of black rock taken from a recent volcanic eruption, and riddled with tiny holes. \u201cYou can see there's a lot of porosity.\u201d\nIceland has an abundance of volcanic basalt, and this bedrock acts like a storage reservoir.  When the carbon meets other elements found in the basalt, a reaction kicks off and it solidifies, locking it away as carbonate minerals.\n\u201cHere you can see a lot of these pores are now filled with whitish specks,\u201d says Dr Voight, handling a sample of drilled out rock.\n\u201cSome of these are carbonate minerals. They contain the mineralised CO2.\u201d\nThe process is quick, claims Dr Voight enthusiastically. \u201cWe're not talking about millions of years.\u201d\n\u201cAround 95% of the CO2 was mineralised within two years in the pilot project. This is incredibly fast. On geological timescales at least.\u201d\nCapable of removing 36,000 tonnes of CO2 a year, an amount similar to taking 8,000 petrol cars off the road, Mammoth is almost 10 times larger than Climeworks\u2019 first commercial plant called Orca.\nIt costs Climeworks almost $1,000 (\u00a3774) to capture and store a tonne of CO2. To make money it sells carbon offsets to clients.\n\u201cMammoth has already sold close to a third of its lifetime capacity,\u201d states Mr Chan, who believes technological improvements and scaling up, will drive down future costs.\n\u201cBy the end of the decade, we want to be at a cost of capture of between $300 and $400.\u201d\nAmong its customers are Microsoft, H&M, JP Morgan Chase, Shopify and Lego; as well as over 20,000 individuals who subscribe on Climeworks\u2019 website.\n\u201cWe're following the science,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s senior director of energy and carbon removal, Brian Marrs, previously told the BBC.\n\u201cCarbon removal has to be part of the equation. You can't reduce emissions that are already in the atmosphere, you have to remove them.\u201d\nEventually Mammoth will be dwarfed by US-based Project Cypress, which breaks ground in 2026, and which Climeworks hopes will remove up to a million tonnes of CO2 annually, using new technology which it claims will be cheaper and more energy efficient.\nDAC technology is, however, not without critics who think its over-hyped, pointing to high costs, high energy consumption and limited scale.\nThose critics would argue that capturing CO2 where it is emitted would be far more efficient. \n\u201cIt's much easier to remove the carbon dioxide directly from smokestacks,\u201d says Dr Edvard J\u00fal\u00edus S\u00f3lnes, a professor at the University of Iceland and former Icelandic Environment Minister.\nDespite repeated calls to curb emissions, a record amount of planet-heating CO2 was churned out last year.\nThe UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that emissions must be urgently slashed, but that still won\u2019t be enough to prevent harmful global warming.\nMany climate scientists agree that carbon removal will also be necessary but this also divides opinion.

    "Eurovision singer Joost Klein has expressed his frustration and relief after Swedish police dropped their investigation into a backstage incident that led to his disqualification from the contest.\nThe singer was removed just hours before the grand final in May, after an alleged altercation with a camerawoman.\nBut Swedish prosecutors said on Monday that they could not prove that a gesture Klein had made during the incident \u201cwas capable of causing serious fear,\u201d or that Klein had intended it to scare her.\nWriting on Instagram, the singer welcomed the decision. \"There is no case against me,\" he said, \"because there never was a case.\"\nHowever, he expressed disappointment that it had taken three months for the investigation to be closed.\n\"The last couple of months were terrible,\" he said. \n\"Even though I love to perform anywhere around the world, something didn't feel right. Why did we have to wait so long for an answer?\"\nHe also suggested his disqualification had been motivated by commercial considerations, although it is unclear what those might have been.\n\"Companies just want to protect their money and they tried to use me as a shield,\" he wrote. \"A village against the city.\"\nThis year\u2019s Eurovision Song Contest was unusually tense, marked by months of protests around Israel\u2019s participation. \nSeveral musicians came under pressure to withdraw, while others, including Eric Saade and Bambie Thug, smuggled pro-Palestinian messages into their performances.\nSome contestants complained of a \"tense\" and \"horrible\" atmosphere backstage, while pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups held several marches through the host city of Malm\u00f6, Sweden.\nThe day before the grand final, Klein did not appear at a dress rehearsal to perform his track, Europapa - which was one of the favourites to win.\nShortly afterward, the European Broadcasting Union, which organises the contest, said in a statement it was investigating Klein because of \"an incident\" involving a member of the show\u2019s production crew. \nThe next day, it was revealed that Swedish police had received an allegation of intimidation by a female camera operator. \nThe EBU subsequently removed Klein from the contest, saying it would not have been appropriate for him to take part while a legal process was underway.\nDutch broadcaster Avrotros, which is responsible for arranging the country's Eurovision entry, called the move \"disproportionate\".\nIt said that Klein had been filmed immediately after coming off stage \"against clearly made agreements\" and against his repeated indications that he did not want to be on camera.\nOn Monday, the broadcaster said that the Swedish prosecutor's decision to drop the case validated their initial response.\n\"From the beginning, we have said that this disqualification was unnecessary and disproportionate and so it now appears to be.\n\"We are still deeply disappointed that the Europa adventure of Joost Klein and of the entire Netherlands was brutally ended in this way.\n\"The next step is to have a meeting with the EBU management about this matter at very short notice.\"\nHowever, the EBU defended its decision to expel Klein from the contest.\nJean Philip De Tender, the organisation's deputy director general, said the police investigation was about \u201cwhether a criminal act was committed and not whether Mr Klein behaved inappropriately\".\n\"Like all responsible employers, we do not tolerate inappropriate behaviour and will always respond to any workplace issues that are reported to us,\" he added.\n\"This new development therefore does not have any impact on our decision which we stand by completely.\"\nDespite that, Klein updated his Instagram biography on Monday to read: \"Eurovision 2025\".\n",
    "Over the past week, watched by the world's media, the top leaders of Hamas descended on Qatar to choose a new political leader for their group.\nDelegates flooded in from across the Middle East after almost a year of fighting between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.\nSome arrived shaken, having woken just days before to the news that the group's previous political leader - Ismail Haniyeh - had been killed in a blast in Tehran, allegedly by Israel.\nHaniyeh, who had overseen his group's negotiators in talks with Israel, played a crucial role in Hamas, balancing the militant wing's desire to take the fight to Israel with calls from some to reach a settlement and end the conflict.\nHis position, it was clear, had to be filled quickly.\nAt the mourning ceremony in Doha, Hamas leaders lined up shoulder to shoulder in a huge white tent with carpets and fancy chairs, decorated with pictures of Ismail Haniyeh. Hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects to the movement\u2019s late leader and his bodyguard.\nThe scene was more than a memorial service - it signalled the end of an era and the beginning of a new, more extreme phase.\nThis was not the first time I had witnessed Hamas\u2019s top officials gather to choose a new leader after an unexpected funeral. Back in 2004 I witnessed them meet after Israel assassinated the group\u2019s founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin \u2013 the meeting taking place in his house in Gaza. Less than a month later, Israel killed his successor Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi.\nBut this time the backstage discussions reflected the extent of the crisis and challenges they are facing.\nHamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back into Gaza. Since then, Israel\u2019s military retaliation has killed more than 39,600 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and wounded tens of thousands more. More than half the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed and almost the entire population has been displaced. Dissent against Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, has been growing. The group itself has taken severe losses.\nOn top of this, the killing of Ismail Haniyeh on 31 July in Tehran - a place he had always felt to be a safe haven - was a real shock for the organisation.\nHamas is convinced that Haniyeh was killed by an anti-personnel missile while he was browsing on his phone. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards have said a projectile with a 7kg warhead was used. Some Western media reports say he was killed by a bomb planted in the room beforehand.\n\nBack at Haniyeh\u2019s mourning ceremony in Doha, one man in his mid-60s with white hair and a short beard stood in a corner away from the spotlight.\n\u201cPay close attention to him,\u201d a Hamas media officer told me. Who was he? \u201cHe is the shadowy man, Abu Omar Hassan,\u201d he said.\nAbu Omar Hassan, or Mohamed Hassan Darwish, is the head of the Supreme Shura Council, the top consultative body in Hamas. According to Hamas\u2019s constitution, he was in prime position to be the organisation\u2019s interim head until elections which had been scheduled for next March.\n\u201cHe is the man of the big missions,\u201d I was told.\nAs the mourning ceremony ended, these leaders\u2019 real work began. For two days, the movement\u2019s veteran faces and shadowy figures held meetings in Doha, which has hosted Hamas\u2019s political bureau since 2012, to elect a new leader.\nThey chose Yahya Sinwar, already the group's leader inside Gaza since 2017. The choice may come as a surprise to many, but anyone following his career since Israel released him in the 2011 exchange deal for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit knew he was always likely to lead Hamas one day.\nNo political leader in Hamas has ever been closer to the group\u2019s armed wing. His brother Mohammed leads the largest Hamas military battalion, while Mohammed Deif - the elusive Hamas veteran who led its armed wing for two decades until Israel said it killed him last month - was his neighbour, friend, and classmate. The pair grew up together in Gaza's sprawling Khan Younis refugee camp.\nDespite all this, many may see appointing him to the most important position in Hamas as madness. Israel's security agencies believe Sinwar planned and executed the attack on southern Israel, and he is top of their wanted list.\n\u201cNot all of the people inside Hamas leadership were in favour of the decision,\u201d a senior Hamas official told me. \u201cSome leaders raised their concerns, others pushed for a more moderate person. But in the end he got the majority of the votes.\u201d\nAnother Hamas official who attended the meetings said the movement felt unable to choose the powerful shadow operator Abu Omar Hassan because he had little public profile and was unknown outside the movement, whereas the 7 October attack had given Yahya Sinwar global notoriety.\n\u201cSinwar has become a trademark after 7 October and he has great popularity in the Arab and Islamic worlds,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe enjoys close relations with the axis of resistance supported by Iran, and his appo",
    "Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat has announced her retirement from the sport, a day after she was disqualified for failing the weigh-in at the Olympic Games.\nThe 29-year-old was set to face the US's Sarah Hildebrandt in the finals for the 50kg freestyle category on Wednesday.\nA win would have made her the first female athlete from India to win an Olympic gold medal in any event.\nBut on the morning of the contest, Phogat weighed in a few grams above the 50kg limit and was removed from the draw.\nIn a heartfelt post shared on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, the wrestler said she no longer had the strength to carry on. \n\"Wrestling won and I lost. My dreams are shattered,\" she wrote.\n\"Goodbye wrestling 2001-2024. I will always be indebted to you all. I am sorry.\"\nA three-time Olympian, Phogat has won three Commonwealth Games golds, two World Championships bronze medals and one Asian Games gold medal.\nIn 2021, she was also crowned the Asian Champion.\nEarlier this week, she became the first female Indian wrestler to reach an Olympic final - a feat which would have guaranteed her at least a silver medal if it wasn't for her disqualification. Sakshi Malik, the only other female wrestler to win an Olympic medal for India, had clinched a bronze at Rio 2016.\nPhogat's performance also included one of the biggest upsets at the Games so far, after she beat reigning world champion Yui Susaki from Japan to progress to the quarter-finals.\n\"Vinesh Phogat is India's biggest, bravest, boldest Olympian. We are lucky to have her,\" wrote sports writer Sharda Ugra in ESPN after she defeated Susaki.\nPhogat had reportedly starved herself for a week and spent hours in the sauna to cut weight for the contest. In the previous two Olympics, she had competed in the 53kg category. This was her first outing in the 50kg category - and the wrestler reportedly struggled to meet the weight requirement during her Olympic qualifiers as well.\nPhogat has appealed against her disqualification from the Olympic finals to the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), seeking to be awarded a joint silver medal.\nThis is not the first time Phogat has suffered a setback at the Olympic Games.\nAt Rio 2016, she had been a favourite for the medal until she dislocated her right knee midway through the quarter-final bout. Pictures of her stretched on the mat and writhing in pain had broken hearts in India.\nAfter Tokyo 2021, the wrestler said she went into near depression amid unfair criticism for her performance after she was knocked out in the second round of the contest.\n\"I was alone... Everyone outside is treating me like I am a dead thing,\" she had written in an editorial in the Indian Express newspaper months after the game. \n\"I don\u2019t know when I will return,\" she had said. \n\"Maybe I won\u2019t. I feel I was better off with that broken leg [at Rio 2016]. I had something to correct. Now my body is not broken, but I\u2019m truly broken.\u201d\nShe did return - \"one more shot,\" as she called it - and went on to win a bronze at the World Championships in 2022. \nPhogat, who belongs to a family of international female wrestlers, is also a vocal critic of the sexist attitudes towards women in sports.\nLast year, she became the face of a months-long protest by wrestlers against their federation chief Brij Bhushan Singh who was accused of sexually harassing female athletes - a charge he denies.\nThe row made headlines globally, especially after the police detained Phogat and other wrestlers during a demonstration. \nDramatic images showing her being dragged by officers and being loaded in a police van had caused international outrage.\nIn 2021, she told BBC Sport how she faced sexist remarks growing up and overcame gender stereotypes to forge a successful career as a professional athlete.\nOn Thursday, fans said Phogat might be done with wrestling but her legacy and contribution to the sport would live on forever. \nMeanwhile, India's run at the Paris Olympics faced another setback after wrestler Antim Panghal was charged with violating disciplinary rules, after she tried to \"smuggle\" her sister into the Olympic Games Village.\nHer sister reportedly used Antim's accreditation to enter the premises but was detained by the police. \nPanghal and her entire contingent will now be deported from Paris.

    "\"Nature, thou art my goddess\".\nPaul Powlesland was not far off quoting Shakespeare when he became probably the first juror in history to swear a legal oath on a river.\nJurors are either required to make a promise to tell the truth or to swear on a holy book when they attend court.\nInstead the lawyer and activist produced a vial of water taken from the River Roding, at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London.\n\nHe was met with a \"quizzical\" look from the court usher, who asked him to do a sip test to ensure it was not a toxic substance.\n\"The judge called me in and said he'd never had a request like this before - he wasn't hostile at all, intrigued if anything,\" he told the BBC. \nMr Powlesland explained that his devotion for the river, which includes planting trees along its banks, removing litter and campaigning against water pollution, is like a religion.\n\"I told him the river was effectively my god, and that I hold the river to be sacred\".\nOn this basis, the judge allowed the oath alongside an affirmation.\n\"Although I love my river I don't know what Thames Water have been doing to it recently.\"\nThe 38-year-old lives on a boat on the Roding, the third-largest river in London. He is the founder of the River Roding Trust, a charity that works to clean and preserve the river. \nHe is also the co-founder of Lawyers for Nature, a group that advocates for legal representation for elements of the natural world.\n\"It's really to try and reimagine the relationship between nature and the law, and for me it's a powerful thing to bring a piece of that nature into the courtroom.\"\n\nEarlier this year the BBC revealed nine major English water companies have reported data suggesting they have discharged raw sewage when the weather is dry \u2013 a practice which is potentially illegal.\n\"Rivers have no legal representation - we increasingly have situations where environmental laws don't protect rivers\", Mr Powlesland said. \nHe said he hopes his oath encourages more people to consider the environment when acting as a juror, and in their day-to-day lives.\n\"I fundamentally believe that until we take small steps to regard nature as sacred again, rather than a human commodity, the situation is not going to change\".\nAfter delivering a verdict in the case on Friday, Judge Charles Falk told the jury:\n\u201cYou tried this case faithfully according to the evidence, as you took an oath to do, whether on a river or otherwise.\u201d",
    "The Royal Mint, maker of the UK's coins, has begun processing electronic waste to extract gold from it.\nThe company has built a large industrial plant on its site in Llantrisant in Wales to remove the precious metal from old circuit boards.\nThe gold is initially being used to craft jewellery and later it will be made into commemorative coins.\nE-waste, which includes anything from old phones and computers to TVs, is a rapidly growing problem - the UN says 62m tonnes were thrown away in 2022.\nIts latest report estimates that the mountain of discarded tech is set to increase by about a third by 2030.\nAt the Royal Mint plant, piles of circuit boards are being fed into the new facility.\nFirst, they are heated to remove their various components. Then the array of detached coils, capacitors, pins and transistors are sieved, sorted,  sliced and diced as they move along a conveyor belt.\nAnything with gold in it is set aside.\n\u201cWhat we're doing here is urban mining,\u201d says head of sustainability Inga Doak.\n\u201cWe're taking a waste product that's being produced by society and we're mining the gold from that waste product and starting to see the value in that finite resource.\u201d\nThe gold-laden pieces go to an on-site chemical plant.\nThey\u2019re tipped into a chemical solution which leaches the gold out into the liquid.\nThis is then filtered, leaving a powder behind.  It looks pretty nondescript but this is actually pure gold \u2013 it just needs to be heated in a furnace to be transformed into a gleaming nugget.\n\u201cTraditional gold recovery processes are very energy intensive and use very toxic chemicals that can only be used once, or they go to high energy smelters and they're basically burnt,\u201d says Leighton John, the Royal Mint's operations director.\n\u201cThe groundbreaking thing for us is the fact that this chemistry is used at room temperature, at very low energy, it\u2019s recyclable and pulls gold really quickly.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no shortage of e-waste for the Royal Mint to target. The UN's 2024 e-waste report places the UK as the second biggest producer of tech trash per capita, beaten only by Norway.\n\u201cOur aim is to process over 4,000 tonnes of e-waste annually,\u201d says Leighton John.\n\u201cTraditionally this waste is shipped overseas but we're keeping it in the UK and we're keeping those elements in the UK for us to use. It's really important.\u201d\nFour thousand tonnes of e-waste should generate up to 450kg of gold, which is worth about \u00a327m at current prices.\nThis shift into the waste business is a big change for the Royal Mint.\nFor more than a thousand years, it has been the UK\u2019s official coin maker.\nBut with cash use dwindling, e-waste is a new way for the government-owned company to make money  - and save jobs.\n\u201cWe needed to diversify,\u201d explains CEO Anne Jessopp.\n\u201cAnd given that less people are now needed to make coins, actually it was an ideal opportunity to move people across [to e-waste processing] so that we could keep jobs for those people.\u201d\nAs well as recovering gold, the company is also looking at what to do with all of the other materials that it is separating out from the circuit boards.\nThey contain a number of different materials including aluminium, copper, tin and steel. They\u2019re also investigating whether ground up boards could be used by the construction industry.",
    "\u201cOne, two, three, four, Sheikh Hasina is a dictator!\"\nThe words had become a rallying cry for young Bangladeshis in recent weeks - and on Monday their fury ended the prime minister's 15-year reign. \nThe 76-year-old Ms Hasina had ruled the South Asian nation of 170 million with an iron fist since 2009 - just a month ago, protests demanding her resignation would have been unthinkable.\nBut by Monday morning, she was stuck in a deadly stalemate. It had been several days since the top court scrapped the job quotas that originally sparked the protests in early July. But the agitation continued, morphing into an anti-government movement that wanted her out of power.  \nWhat finally tipped the scales was the ferocity of the clashes between the protesters and police on Sunday. Nearly 300 people are estimated have died in the violence so far but Sunday alone saw at least 90 people, including 13 police officers, killed - the worst single day of casualties incurred during protests in Bangladesh\u2019s recent history. \nCritics called it \u201ccarnage\u201d, even as Ms Hasina stood her ground.  \nBangladesh PM resigns and flees country: Follow live\nAnd yet, tens of thousands took to the streets on Monday, many of them marching towards the capital Dhaka, in defiance of a nationwide curfew.  \nBangladeshis, it appeared, no longer feared bullets. What had been a political movement was now a mass uprising. \nMs Hasina's decision to flee was also hastened by the military, which would have put pressure on her to step down. The army, which has ruled Bangladesh in the past and is still hugely respected,  has an outsized influence over the country's politics.  \nThe violence from the weekend as well as the prospect of facing fresh rounds of massive protests would have made the military establishment re-think its options.   \nJunior officers had already raised concerns about being asked to fire on civilians in a meeting with the military chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, on Friday. \nWhat lies ahead is less clear but Gen Zaman is in talks with \"various stakeholders\", including opposition parties and civil society groups to find an \"interim\" solution, a high-level source familiar with the matter tells the BBC.   \nIt is no surprise that Ms Hasina has fled to India. It's unclear what counsel she received from across the border but Bangladesh's giant neighbour has been a crucial ally of hers throughout. \nIt is partly why, as her popularity diminished, strong sentiment against India grew within Bangladesh. \nDelhi always viewed its foothold in Bangladesh as key to the security of the seven landlocked states in India's north-east, most of which share a border with Bangladesh. Ms Hasina has given transit rights to India to make sure goods from its mainland make it to those states. \nShe also clamped down on anti-India militant groups based in Bangladesh, a key issue in India.\nBut in recent weeks, Delhi faced a dilemma - by backing its unpopular ally, it risked alienating a mass movement and damaging its long-term relationship with Bangladesh. Ms Hasina's resignation has solved that problem. \nThe daughter of Bangladesh's founding president, Sheikh Hasina had been the world\u2019s longest-serving female head of government. \nHer father was assassinated with most of the family in a military coup in 1975 - only Ms Hasina and her younger sister survived as they were travelling abroad at the time.\nAfter living in exile in India, she returned to Bangladesh in 1981 and joined hands with other political parties to lead a popular uprising for democracy that made her a national icon.\nMs Hasina was first elected to power in 1996 but later lost to her rival Begum Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 2001.\nShe came back to power in 2009 in polls held under a caretaker government.\nHer time in power was rife with accusations of forced disappearances, extra-judicial killings, and the crushing of opposition figures and her critics - she denied the charges, and her government often accused the main opposition parties of fuelling protests.\nIn recent weeks too, Ms Hasina and her party - the Awami League - blamed their political opponents for the unrest that gripped the country. \nBut this time, the anger was louder than ever before. It was certainly the most serious challenge Ms Hasina, who won a contentious election in January which the opposition boycotted, had faced during her years in office. \nFor weeks, she had refused to give ground, even calling the protesters \"terrorists\" at one point. \nBut the realisation that the force of the security establishment couldn't keep people off the steets does not augur well for any leader - least of all an embattled one.",

    "Tick numbers in Scotland could almost double if temperatures rise by 4C due to climate change according to new research.\nThe parasites, which spread infections including Lyme disease, are likely to rise in prevalence across the country even if temperatures increase below the long-term target limit of 1.5C.\nBut researchers from the University of Stirling have warned a global rise in temperatures could lead to some currently tick-free habitats sustaining populations by 2080.\nThey said a rise in the number of people catching diseases carried by the arachnids was of \u201cincreasing concern\u201d.\nMathematicians from the university\u2019s faculty of natural sciences said ticks will increase in number by 99% by 2080 if the global temperature rise hits 4C, according to a paper published in the Interface journal.\nA new model developed by the research team, lead by Prof Rachel Norman, found that number fell to 26% if temperatures were kept to a 1C rise.\nWorld leaders promised in 2015 to try to limit the long-term temperature rise to 1.5C to help avoid the most damaging effects.\nBut Prof Norman said that would not be confined to the tick\u2019s natural woodland habitat.\nShe said: \u201cThe strength of these predicted increases in tick density varied depending on the habitat.\n\"While woodland habitats were predicted to experience the highest absolute increases, the largest proportional increases were predicted for the slopes of mountains, known as montane habitats.\n\"Many of these areas that were predicted to be tick-free under recent climatic conditions were predicted to become warm enough to allow sustained tick populations by 2080.\"\nLyme disease has likely infected about one in 10 people across the globe, according to a British Medical Journal (BMJ) global health review.\nHowever, there are issues with identifying and treating the bacterial infection, which can only be passed to humans by infected ticks.\nThe infection, which can cause facial paralysis, memory loss and heart arrythmia, is often misdiagnosed as meningitis.\nA bite from an infected tick can often, but not always, create a \u201cbullseye\u201d rash on the recipient.\nIt can be treated with a course of antibiotics, but symptoms can sometimes persist for months or even years after treatment.\nBlood tests are able to identify certain strains of the disease, but not all.\nAnd not all ticks carry the disease.\nSome of Scotland\u2019s higher peaks will be too cold to experience the same rise in tick numbers.\nIt is hoped the statistical model developed by Prof Norman and her team could be adapted to predict the risk of increases in other diseases.\n\"While we developed the approach to predict tick densities over Scotland, it could be easily used for other areas and other vector species, and pathogens could be added to the model, enabling predictions of disease risk,\" she said.\n\"Indeed, this methodology could be used more broadly to understand the dynamic response of populations over time to a variety of environmental changes and provides a neat new method in the modelling toolbox for researchers to choose from.\"",

    "Six new regional centres created to support under 18s struggling with their gender identity will open over the next two years, NHS England has confirmed.\nThey will join two existing clinics, as part of an overhaul of gender services for children and young people.\nThe emphasis will be on providing a more holistic approach, with a particular focus on supporting mental health and those with conditions such as autism.\nIt follows a ban earlier this year on the routine prescription of puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria. The changes come in response to a landmark review published in April, which was critical of the way young people had been supported.\nThe Cass Review \u2013 led by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass \u2013 called for better psychological support, noting that young people struggling with their gender had higher rates of mental health problems and neurodiversity - such as autism and ADHD, or had experienced childhood trauma.\nPreviously, the only NHS clinic providing gender services for children was the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust in London.\nIt was criticised for its approach which relied heavily on medical intervention, using puberty blockers to delay the onset of puberty, despite a lack of evidence the medication had a positive impact. \nIts services had previously been rated as inadequate by inspectors in January 2021.\n\nThe Tavistock clinic was closed in March. \nTwo new services, in London and the north-west of England, were opened in April, run in conjunction with leading children's hospitals Great Ormond Street and Liverpool\u2019s Alder Hey.\nThe planned opening of six new regional hubs begins this autumn in Bristol, with another in the East of England due to open in March 2025. \nThe clinics will also serve children and young people in Wales. Ministers in Scotland are considering a similar approach.\nNHS England has also announced details of how the clinics will work. \nGPs will no longer be able to refer patients directly. Instead, referrals will have to come via children and young people\u2019s mental health services and hospital child health specialists.\nThe move is designed to ensure the wider needs of these children are assessed before they are sent to a specialist centre, and follows a sharp rise in referrals in recent years.\nHowever, a proposal to only allow referrals after the age of seven was dropped.\nAdditionally, care at the specialist centres will be overseen by a paediatrician or psychiatrist, with input from a range of other specialists.\nAlongside mental health support and help for conditions such as autism, there will be an emphasis on supporting the whole family, including some social care provision in cases where there has been a breakdown in family relations. \nAdvice and guidance about social transitioning \u2013 when a young person presents as the opposite gender to their biological sex - will also be available.\nThe regional centres will also support young people turning 18 who wish to access adult gender care services, where hormone treatments and surgery are available \u2013 although these services are also set to be reviewed, NHS England has said.\nNHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the new system was about establishing a \u201cfundamentally different and safer model of care for children and young people\u201d.\nNHS England hopes the changes will also help reduce waiting times. \nA freedom of information request by PA Media, released this week, showed the average waiting time was 100 weeks for the 5,700 under-18s on the waiting list for specialist gender care. The youngest individual on the waiting list was under five years old.\nNHS England also said trials to gather evidence on the risks and benefits of using puberty blockers was due to start in 2025.\nDr Cass said she was \u201cpleased\u201d NHS England was pushing ahead with implementing her recommendations.\nMuch of the medical establishment has been supportive of the changes she recommended.\nBut the British Medical Association has been critical, calling for the ban on puberty blockers to be lifted.\nBMA leader Prof Phil Banfield said while the announcement by NHS England provided 'clarity' for patients there needed to be more done to improve care.\nHe said the BMA was carrying out its own evaluation into what should be provided.\n\n",

    "For days, similar scenes have played out across England and parts of Northern Ireland - unrest, communities in fear, a huge police presence, with the flames being fanned by social media.\nFor days, journalists at BBC News have been contacting big tech companies, trying to find out what they are doing about it.\nWhatever it is, they don't want to talk about it - the messaging app Telegram has been the only firm to issue an on-the-record statement.\nIt is hoped the tide has started to turn on the streets. But if they hoped that by keeping quiet they would avoid further scrutiny, the tech firms may well be wrong.\n\"I think it is horrendous they are not taking more ownership of what is happening\", says Baroness Martha Lane Fox, one of the leading lights in the UK tech scene.\nShe knows big tech from the inside, having sat on the board of Twitter, as it was then called.\n\"Generally, they don\u2019t like getting involved in politics - it doesn\u2019t serve them well\", she told the BBC.\nGiven the UK is a relatively small market, in global terms, she's \"not surprised\" by the silence - but says it should not deter the government from acting.\n\"The lack of accountability and serious regulation that is taking this on is something I think that should alarm all of us\", she says.\nVery little.\nMeta - the company behind Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - has made no comment at all. TikTok, Snapchat and the messaging app Signal have also remained silent.\nA well-placed source at Snapchat told BBC News the company remained in close contact with the regulator, Ofcom, and the UK government.\nTelegram, meanwhile, was in the news after a list purporting to contain the names and address of immigration lawyers was spread online after starting life on the messaging app. The Law Society of England and Wales said it treated the list as a \"very credible threat\" to its members.\nTelegram did not comment specifically on the list, but did tell the BBC that its moderators were \"actively monitoring the situation and are removing channels and posts containing calls to violence\".\nCalls to violence were explicitly forbidden by the messaging platform's terms of service, it said.\nAnd then there is X.\nX, formerly Twitter, has not responded to any of our requests for comment. \nIn relation to the riots, there have been false claims, hate and conspiracy theories on the platform.\nWhen Elon Musk bought it in 2022, he reduced its content moderation. A year later, far-right activist Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was reinstated to X after a five-year ban.\nLast weekend, Robinson was posting inflammatory messages to his followers on X while relaxing in Cyprus.\nX may have been silent this week, but its owner has not.\nWhile commenting about the riots, Mr Musk tweeted \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d - a post condemned by the spokesperson of the prime minister.\nMr Musk then posted \"why aren\u2019t all communities being protected in Britain?\u201d, and  #TwoTierKeir \u2013 a hashtag used over accusations of \u2018two-tier policing\u2019.\nMr Musk also deleted an image he had shared, which promoted a conspiracy theory about the UK building \"detainment camps\" on the Falkland Islands for rioters.\n\"I think that tech companies are often hesitant to wade into politically charged situations\", Matt Navarra, a social media expert, told BBC News.\n\"I think they fear alienating portions of their user base or becoming entangled in regulatory battles.\" \nHe said it is a \"strategic calculation\". \n\"By remaining silent, they hope the public attention will shift elsewhere, and they can avoid direct responsibility,\" he added.\nThe companies are, he says, prioritising their bottom line over \"public safety and social responsibility\".\nAdam Leon Smith, Fellow of BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT said the silence was \"incredibly disrespectful\" to the public.\nMedia analyst Hanna Kahlert at Midia Research suggested they did not want to say things in public they could for fear of being held to those comments at a later date.\n\"They are probably going to be very cautious about how they comment on it, because that's going to define their strategy moving forward - what they are able to do, what their algorithms promote, which for them are activities that brings in ad revenue.\"\nMore powers are coming the regulator's way via the Online Safety Act, due to come into force early next year.\nOfcom published an open letter to platforms saying they should not wait until then before taking action.\nBut some - including the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan - are already questioning whether that is enough.\nThe prime minister said on Friday that \"we're going to have to look more broadly at social media after this disorder\".\nProf Lorna Woods, a professor of internet law at the University of Essex - who helped shape the legislation - told BBC News: \"If the Act were fully in force, it wouldn't catch all the content.

    "For many young women, there have been very few film adaptations as hotly anticipated as Colleen Hoover's It Ends With Us.\nThe 2016 book became an internet sensation a few years ago - it took TikTok's #booktok by storm with more than one billion tags and sold 20 million copies as the number one New York Times bestseller.\nWhile on the surface the film appears to be a standard romantic comedy, it comes with a dark twist. \nStarring Gossip Girl star Blake Lively, it tells the story of Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and winds up in the same position years later.\nLily, a florist in Boston, navigates a complicated love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend Ryle Kincaid - played by Jane the Virgin's Justin Baldoni -  and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan, acted by Brandon Sklenar.\nSpeaking to the BBC at the premiere, Lively says she felt the \"responsibility of servicing the people that care so much about the source material\". \n\"I really feel like we delivered a story that's emotional and it's fun, but also funny, painful, scary, tragic and it's inspiring and that's what life is, it's every single colour,\" says the 36-year-old actress who is married to fellow actor Ryan Reynolds.\nBut the film has been met with some criticism that it romanticises domestic abuse.\nA two-star review from The Telegraph called it a \"queasy drama\" that \"repackages domestic violence as slick romance\". \nTim Robey added that the film \"splices abuse and glossy courtship in the big city to deeply dubious effects\". \nHoover has explained that her inspiration for the novel was the domestic abuse that her mother endured. \nRebecca Goshawk, who works for Solace, a charity that supports victims of gender-based violence, says she is worried about how the film may have covered domestic abuse. \n\"Film can be a really powerful way for young people to see examples of domestic abuse and educate them about healthy relationships,\" she explains. \n\"But when it's done poorly it's really worrying as it could romanticise unhealthy relationships and young people don't have the knowledge to see what is dangerous behaviour.\"\nLively, who is also credited as a producer, tells the BBC that she is adamant the film has been made sensitively and \"with lots of empathy\". \n\"Lily is a survivor and a victim and while they are huge labels, these are not her identity. She defines herself and I think it's deeply empowering that no one else can define you.\" \nFans at the premiere also say that they don't think the book or film romanticise unhealthy relationships.\nTaylor Lopez, 19, says that showing the story from the perspective of a victim who grapples with the difficult decision of loving someone but also needing to leave them is done really well. \nHer friends Phoebe and Celina agree, adding that the film \"perfectly comes together\" and \"the feelings and experiences of the characters are so relatable\".\nThey all also think that Lively, who rose to fame in the 2000s playing Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, is the perfect casting. \n\"In the book Lily is a 23-year-old and so people have complained about her casting but actually she's the perfect choice,\" Celina explains. \nHowever, the critics have not been so favourable, awarding the film a mix of two and three stars. \nThe Independent said the film was \"sincere but completely ludicrous\" in a two-star review and added that Lively's character \"does not register as a real person, so, it\u2019s odd, and a little uncomfortable, to see her burdened with such raw trauma\".\nThe Guardian acknowledged that there were \"expected clich\u00e9s, but there are also many that are mercifully avoided too, the story not always conforming to type\". \nA four-star review from The Times was one of the most favourable and described the film as \"Pretty Woman meets 50 Shades of Grey\u201d and a \"dizzy, guilty pleasure\". \n\"Lively is perfectly cast and has that combination of self-consciousness, determination and doubt that is wholly fitting for a character yearning to break free from the coercive clutches of those around her,\" Kevin Maher wrote. \nAdaptations of popular books, particularly those read by younger women such as Twilight and The Hunger Games, have become blockbuster hits. \nHoover and Lively's loyal and impressively large fan bases may help It Ends With Us on to that list, despite the lukewarm response by the critics.",
    "Riot police were deployed in Stoke-on-Trent after hundreds of people protested in the wake of the Southport attacks.\nThe demonstration was one of several across the UK on Saturday, some of which turned violent.\nOfficers in Stoke-on-Trent city centre came under fire from missiles at one point and Staffordshire Police said two men were also hit by a blunt object that was thrown.\nTen people were arrested in connection with the disorder and remained in custody on Saturday evening, the force said.\nThe 10 arrested, aged from 15 to 52, were mostly from the Stoke-on-Trent or Staffordshire area, officers said.\nThree police officers were assaulted and suffered minor injuries.\nA crowd of about 400 people gathered at about 11:30 BST in Hanley along with other groups of counter-protesters, including one outside the now-closed Hanley Town Hall.\nEarlier in the day the protests were largely peaceful but Staffordshire Police said a number of demonstrators had been dispersed by officers during the day and a large-scale policing operation remained in place six hours on.\nA Section 34 dispersal notice was also authorised allowing police to disperse people who might return to the area.\nMisinformation had been common on several social media platforms during the day and in an evening update the force said claims of two stabbings were \"false\".\nIt said no stabbings were reported to police \"despite videos fuelling speculation on social media\".\nOne in particular, which showed a man being treated for an injury to his head, \"fuelled the speculation\", a spokesperson added.\n\"We would like to reiterate that two men involved in the incident were hit with a blunt object that was thrown in the air,\" they said and added their injuries were not thought to be serious.\nIslamophobic chants could be heard on some video footage while others showed officers coming under fire from missiles.\nMembers of the North Staffordshire Campaign Against Racism staged a counter-protest.\nOne of them, Sarah Breene-Crum, said: \"It's an insult to the families that have lost their children, the way that the far-right have behaved over the last few days.\"\nSimon Crum added: \"There is a silent majority out there that are moderate and want a fairer society where we do allow immigrants and we look after refugees and we look after everyone.\"\nAs protesters made their way through Hanley, several buildings were closed for a time as well as a main route out of the city centre.\nA spokesperson for The Irish Woodman pub in Hanley said they and other firms in the area closed for the day due to the protests.\n\"Due to the terrible events in Hanley at the moment I've made the decision to close the pub for the rest of the day along with other businesses in Hanley,\" they said in a post on Facebook.\nSaturday\u2019s protests, sparked by the death of three girls at a holiday dance session on Monday, came on the same day as a children\u2019s dance production at Stoke-on-Trent's Regent Theatre.\nThe presence of protesters outside following a matinee performance of Never Give Up forced the venue to go into lockdown, one parent said, to protect the children. \nHe said it was \"scary\" in the city centre, particularly knowing his daughter and other children were caught up in it.\nHe added that while protesters had since moved on and the lockdown lifted, the evening performance was in the balance and might not go ahead.\nAnother event, Summer Sounds at The Underground in the city centre ended early as a precaution.\nOne person who was involved with the event said it was after taking advice from the police.\nOn Saturday morning, the force had advised local people to stay indoors and if they needed to go out, not to do so alone. \nAssistant Chief Constable Stuart Ellison said a large number of police officers would remain in Hanley on Saturday night.\n\u201cViolent disorder of any form is completely unacceptable and those who are responsible will be met with the full force of the law,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Robert the Bruce's victory at 1314's Battle of Bannockburn is celebrated in the song Flower of Scotland and he has been portrayed on TV and in film - famously in Hollywood's Braveheart.\nBut have we been saying his name wrong for years?\nAccording to a new episode of BBC Radio 4's You're Dead to Me, some historians would prefer to see the \"the\" in his name get the chop.\nIt is argued the King of Scots was likely never known as The Bruce in his lifetime, and his name was corrupted hundreds of years after his death.\nBruce was crowned in 1306 at Scone Palace, near Perth, and died in Cardross in 1329.\nHistorian Greg Jenner, who hosts You're Dead to Me, said: \"We chose to do Robert Bruce because there is so much name recognition and there is the big anniversary of course - 750 years since his birth.\n\"He is so important for Scottish people. And he is a symbol - he was the king that won independence.\"\nJenner, who was historian on the Horrible Histories TV show for 11 years, describes You're Dead to Me as a comedy show that takes history seriously.\nHe said: \"We pair up comedians at the top of their game with fantastic academics and we have this great conversation on a subject.\"\nOver more than 100 episodes so far, the show has explored the stories of Queen of Sheba, American showman PT Barnum, Agatha Christie - and the history of time itself.\nFor Robert Bruce, the show brought together Shetland comedian Marjolein Robertson and Dr Iain MacInnes, a Dornoch-based senior lecturer in history at the University of the Highlands and Islands.\nJenner said: \"It is a funny romp through his life talking about the politics of the 13-14th Century between Scotland and England and politics internally in Scotland.\"\nHe said Bruce would swap sides depending on which would benefit him the most, adding: \"Robert Bruce was a strategist. He played the game.\"\nThe Bruce family, who originally came from France, had a claim to the Scottish throne following the death of King Alexander III.\nDr MacInnes said Bruce was ruthless in his ambition, and murdered a rival in a church and was prepared to put Scots, English and Irish \"to sword\".\n\"He makes himself king violently,\" said the academic.\nAway from the battles and bloody campaigning, the show has examined some of the myths and contentious issues around the King of Scots - including that name.\nDr MacInnes said: \"I think it's a corruption of the Bruces' name in Latin - de Bruce - but it is used to emphasis the prominence of him in Scottish history.\n\"It does make him stand out a bit more, but it is not likely he was known as Robert the Bruce when he was alive. He was the seventh Robert Bruce and named after his father and grandfather.\"\nDr MacInnes said some historians would prefer he be called Robert Bruce, as he would be if he was alive today.\nHe added: \"Ultimately he should be King Robert I, rather than Robert the Bruce.\"\nYou're Dead to Me is available on BBC Sounds and 30 minute episodes are broadcast on Radio 4 on Saturdays.",
    "Pharmacists have warned people not to buy fake weight-loss jabs online as a shortage of Ozempic is expected to stretch into next year. \nThe National Pharmacy Association (NPA) suggested there could be a possible \"explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online\" as a result.\nWeight-loss injections have been popularised with celebrity endorsements and before and after pictures online, but fake versions can be dangerous.\nOzempic is a brand of semaglutides which help people with type 2 diabetes regulate their blood sugar levels, but are increasingly being prescribed for weight loss in some countries.\nCurrently there is a shortage of Ozempic due to high demand and some doctors prescribing off-label, as it is not licensed for weight loss. \nWhile Ozempic, available on the NHS, helps people with type 2 diabetes, its ability to suppress appetite has led to people using it to lose weight. \nThis has led to a shortage of the drug as well as an increase in counterfeit jabs. \nWegovy, another brand of semaglutide, is licensed for weight management and is also available on the NHS. \nThe NPA, which represents 5,000 independent community pharmacies across the UK, is urging people to speak to a pharmacist or GP instead of buying medicines online from sellers who are not registered or regulated in the UK. \nIt also warned the shortage of Ozempic, made by pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, is likely to continue into next year. \nNPA chairman Nick Kaye said: \u201cPharmacists remain deeply concerned that the current medicine shortages crisis could lead to an explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online.\n\u201cStocks of Ozempic are very depleted in community pharmacy in the UK and it is important that these remain prioritised for those in the most clinical need.\n\u201cGiven the precarious state of supply of this and other vital medication, there is a much greater risk of people looking to order in supplies from disreputable online vendors.\"\nLast year the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) reported a very small number of people being hospitalised, including for hypoglycaemic shock and coma, after using potentially fake pens.  \nIn January, the Department of Health and Social Care told healthcare providers not to prescribe the drugs off-label for weight loss and said existing stock must be reserved for patients with type 2 diabetes. \nIt said the supply issues were being caused by increased demand and off-label use. \n\"We don\u2019t know how prevalent off-label prescribing is but we do know [it happens],\" Mr Kaye said. \nHe suggested people can check to see if an online provider is registered by the General Pharmaceutical Council or Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland. \nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"We strongly advise the public not to buy regulated medicines from unauthorised online retailers or beauty salons as they could be dangerous.\"\nIt added the MHRA would continue to take action against those unlawfully trading in medicines, and said that the government was trying to tackle the obesity crisis by shifting the focus from treatment to prevention.

    "Reported sexual offences have risen year on year by more than 10% on Tubes, trains and buses across the capital, figures from Transport for London (TfL) show.\nThere were 2,671 sexual offences on the network reported to the police between February 2023 and January 2024, according to TfL figures given in response to a Freedom of Information request.\nThe rise in recorded offences has been accompanied by an increase in \u201cbystander intervention\u201d from passengers, TfL says.

    "Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr does not meet the legal requirement of a New York resident and therefore cannot be on the state's election ballot, a judge has ruled.\nKennedy's claim of a New York address as his \"place of residence\" on nominating petitions was a \"false statement\", said Judge Christina Ryba.\nAs a result, the petitions were considered invalid. Mr Kennedy has rejected the judge's ruling and vows to appeal.\nIf the ruling is upheld, it would not only bar Mr Kennedy from the New York ballot but could also lead to challenges in other states where he uses that address. \nMr Kennedy dismissed the ruling as a partisan attack and noted the judge as a Democrat.\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t confident they can win at the ballot box, so they are trying to stop voters from having a choice,\" he said in a statement. \n\"We will appeal and we will win.\u201d\nMr Kennedy, 70, had argued in court that he considered New York his home since childhood and intended to return.\nHe currently lives in California which he moved to in 2014 to be with his wife, Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl Hines.\nIn court, Mr Kennedy sought to make the case that he has been renting a bedroom from a friend in Katonah, roughly 40 miles (65 km) north of Manhattan.\nThe friend, Barbara Moss, testified in court that she charges Mr Kennedy $500 (\u00a3301) a month. She also said there was no written lease. \nMr Kennedy also offered evidence of his residency by showing that he pays New York state taxes and has a law practice in the state.\nHowever, in her 34-page ruling, Judge Ryba said \"the overwhelming credible evidence introduced at trial\" suggested that Mr Kennedy only held a New York address for \"political standing\".\n\u201cGiven the size and appearance of the spare bedroom as shown in the photographs admitted into evidence, the Court finds Kennedy\u2019s testimony that he may return to that bedroom to reside with his wife, family members, multiple pets, and all of his personal belongings to be highly improbable, if not preposterous,\u201d the judge wrote.\nMr Kennedy is the most well-known independent candidate but his popularity appears to have plummeted since Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris entered the race.",
    "Newly released footage from local Pennsylvania police reveals a clearer picture of the moments surrounding the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in July.  \nIn one body-camera video, a local officer tells colleagues he told the US Secret Service ahead of time to secure the building the gunman used. \nAnother shows the moment an officer is hoisted on to a rooftop and lays eyes on the gunman, seconds before he opens fire at the Trump rally. \nTrump was nicked by a bullet in the shooting, one person was killed and two others badly injured. \nThe body and dashboard footage was released on Thursday to US media outlets by the Butler Township Police Department. \nThey capture moments of frustration, confusion and miscommunication in the moments before and after the assassination attempt. \nIn one, a local officer said he had asked the Secret Service to man the building where the gunman had fired from, days before the rally. \n\u201cI told them they need to post guys over there,\" he said, according to one video obtained by the Wall Street Journal.\n\"I told them that [on] Tuesday.\" \nThe open-air rally took place on Saturday 13 July.\nThe officer appears angry as he tells his colleagues that he asked the Secret Service to secure the building.\n\u201cI talked to the Secret Service guys, they were like, \u2018Yeah, no problem, we\u2019re going to post guys over here,\u2019\u201d the officer says.\nThomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot and killed by the Secret Service counter-sniper team after he fired eight bullets in Trump\u2019s direction from a rooftop just outside the rally's security perimeter.\nThe would-be assassin was on a building in what police have described as a \"secondary ring\", which was patrolled not by the Secret Service but by local and state officers.\nTrump, who was on stage addressing supporters, was wounded in the ear before he ducked and Secret Service agents pulled him off stage. \nIn another video, a Butler County police officer is seen being hoisted up by a colleague on to the rooftop where he spots Crooks. \nHe quickly drops down when he sees the gunman is armed.\nHe is then seen running to the other side of the building and to his police car to retrieve a rifle.\nAround 40 seconds after the officer first lays eyes on the gunman, Crooks fires at Trump.\nThe officer shouts to his colleague: \"He's straight up ... Who's got eyes on him?\"\nThe video then shows police officers trying to access the roof.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got glasses, long hair,\u201d the officer who saw Crooks tells them, adding he has a book bag and an AR-style rifle. \nAfter getting on the roof, the officers see Crooks\u2019 body. \nThe first police officer is then heard saying: \"I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself,\" adding that he \"started calling out\" that a gunman was on the roof.\n\"Were you on the same frequency?\" he is heard asking, referring to the police radio.\nIn other footage, one officer reportedly appears confused as to why the rooftop was unmanned.\n\"I thought it was you! I thought you guys were on the roof!\" He then swears in frustration and asked: \"Why are we not on the roof?\"  \nThe state police had posted three counter-snipers inside one of the adjacent buildings. \nOne of them had spotted Crooks earlier in the day following reports among the law enforcement on site of a suspicious person at the rally.\nThe state police sniper then took a photo of Crooks before leaving his post to search for the suspect.\nBBC News has not seen all the videos. Their contents were reported on by multiple US news outlet. \nIn a statement on Thursday, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency was reviewing the footage.\n\"The US Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,\" he said. \n\"The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was a US Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\"\nThe FBI is also investigating the incident, as is a bipartisan House panel made up of 13 lawmakers.",
    "Offering to boost the exam results of pupils affected by the crumbling concrete crisis would not be fair on others, the head of England's exam regulator has said. \nSome parents at St Leonard's Catholic School in Durham, where schooling has been disrupted by Raac, called for their children's marks to be uplifted.\nOfqual's Sir Ian Bauckham said it would be \"difficult\" to allow results to be changed for affected students and not offer similar adjustments for other issues such as teacher shortages. \nNicola Cook, whose son is awaiting his A Level results, said Sir Ian's comments were \"out of touch with reality\". \nA report by Durham University academics has also called for a boost of 10% for some of those affected. \nWhen it came to boosting the exam results of some pupils, Sir Ian said it would be very difficult to know \"how you would draw a line and maintain fairness\".\nHe said many schools had dealt with issues with crumbling concrete \"quite quickly\".\n\"I would be surprised if there was an impact that was significant enough to impact results as a whole,\" he said.\nBut Ms Cook said Sir Ian had \"no comprehension\" of what pupils at St Leonard's had faced over the past year. \n\"Our school lost 80% of its buildings with temporary teaching spaces only delivered at Easter,\" she said. \n\"How then is it fair that our children are being benchmarked against those who haven't faced this type of unmitigated disruption?\"\nSir Ian, Ofqual's chief regulator, said he was optimistic universities would be \"as flexible as they're able to be\" when deciding whether to accept a pupil, if Raac disruption had been set out on their UCAS form.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson previously said the Department for Education, Ofqual, UCAS and the Office for Students had worked to ensure higher education providers \"are aware of the circumstances that have been faced by students\" who attended schools with Raac.\n\"They have asked that higher education providers take the impact of disruption into account when considering admissions,\" she added.\nA DfE spokesperson said staff knew Raac had been \"disruptive\" and the qualifications body had published further guidance for schools as to what \"special consideration\" may apply.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Plans for an adventure sports hub have angered wildlife campaigners, who claim it will bring over-development and could threaten nesting birds.\nAdventure Beyond, which offers coasteering and kayaking trips, wants to build a centre for visitors in Moylegrove, Pembrokeshire.\nBut opponents said they wanted the \"fragile ecosystem\" of Ceibwr Bay near Cardigan, Ceredigion, to be \"kept wild\".\nSupporters of the scheme said it would be good for the environment by cutting traffic.\nIn a planning statement provided to Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, Adventure Beyond managing director Jet Moore said a new location was needed to store equipment and vehicles as a nearby farm may no longer be available.\nThe company hopes to provide a \"recreation hub\" where customers can park and get changed. They would then be encouraged to walk or cycle to Ceibwr Bay, about one mile (1.6km) away, for coasteering, kayaking or \"field studies.\"\nThe company employs 12 people full-time or part-time. \nThe development is part-funded by the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, allocated by Pembrokeshire council, and the company has warned the grant must be spent by the end of 2024 or the \"funds will be lost.\"\n\nCampaigner Dagmarr Moore from the Ceibwr Conservation group claimed coasteering was damaging to local nesting birds.\n\"We'd like to see Ceibwr kept wild,\" she said. \n\"We think it's important.

    "An under-pressure ambulance service has announced its latest chief executive, who will take up the post next month.\nNeill Moloney is the seventh boss of East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust (EEAST) in just under 12 years.\nDuring that time, the service has been in special measures and was the first UK NHS trust forced to sign a legal agreement with the Equality and Human Rights Commission to tackle \"high levels\" of sexual harassment.\nEEAST chairman Mrunal Sisodia said Mr Moloney \"joins at a really important point... we have made genuine progress on many staff, cultural and operational issues\".\nThe new chief executive, who starts on 2 September, is currently a director at Mid and South Essex Integrated Care Board and Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust - and has held other senior executive roles, including at NHS England.\nThe trust said his background in emergency care would be \"vital in continuing improvements\" and he was chosen over 300 applicants.\nMr Moloney echoed the sentiment and said he would \"continue the great work already started\", with previous leader Tom Abell having stepped down to take over at the NHS Mid and South Essex Integrated Care Board.\nAt the start of this year NHS England revealed the trust was being removed from \"special measures\" - now known as the National Recovery Support Programme - after four years.\nMr Abell greeted the news as a \"major milestone\", saying response times had \"halved\", with the CQC noting the trust had improved its safeguarding teams and policies. \nMr Abell joined EEAST at a tumultuous point in August 2021 after it was rated inadequate and placed in special measures the previous year, following a Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection.\nThirteen cases of sexual misconduct had been reported to police - with bullying \"normalised\" at the service, according to the CQC.\nThe then South Norfolk MP, Richard Bacon (Conservative), called for the trust to be scrapped and replaced.\nEEAST was also forced to take action over \"high levels\" of sexual harassment and was stripped of its ability to train apprentices because of inappropriate behaviour.\nIn November 2019, it emerged that three members of the service died in just 11 days.\nThe job of chief executive before Mr Abell was temporarily held by Dr Tom Davis after Dorothy Hosein left in January 2021, having initially joined as an interim boss in 2018. \nIt was held by former paramedic Robert Morton from August 2015 until September 2018, by Dr Anthony Marsh, who headed the ambulance service in both the East of England and West Midlands, from December 2013 to August 2015 - and by NHS executive Andrew Morgan, who was brought in as a temporary boss in December 2012.\nUnison's EEAST branch chairman, Glenn Carrington, said: \"We're sorry to lose Tom Abell - I thought he did an admirable job in difficult circumstances - the new chief has got big shoes to fill.\n\"We need continuity - I've been in the service 40 years and I've seen so many chief executives... but we've got a new chief and a new government so hopefully we'll see some light at the end of the tunnel.\"\nEEAST, which employs more than 5,000 staff and has more than 1,000 volunteers, covers Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex.\n\"Challenging times continue for the East of England Ambulance Service due to staff shortages and vehicles being off the road, but under Tom Abell's tenure the issues of a poor organisational culture seem to have improved.\nHe has brought the service out of \"special measures\" and it appears to be heading in the right direction.\nOver the past 18 months, response times to the most serious calls have dramatically improved and that is largely down to how the trust has been working with hospitals to free up ambulances waiting outside A&E departments, getting them back out on the roads quicker.\nHowever, at one point last winter more than a quarter of the trust's ambulances were off the road due to mechanical problems.\nSo while things look on the up, Neill Moloney will be striving to take those improvements already made further.\"\nFollow East of England news on X, Instagram and Facebook: BBC Beds, Herts & Bucks, BBC Cambridgeshire, BBC Essex, BBC Norfolk, BBC Northamptonshire or BBC Suffolk.",

    "A letter written by King Charles complaining about government \u201cred tape\u201d more than 20 years ago has been released by the National Archives.\nIn the 2002 letter, the then Prince of Wales said to a senior UK government minister that \u201cmore prescriptive laws\u201d were creating \u201cincreasing difficulty in many walks of life\u201d.\nHis letter focused on the ability of volunteers to cook at home for people in care homes and soldiers being allowed to take part in live firing exercises.\nThe King said he\u2019d been \u201cwarned\u201d by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair that his views might not be welcomed, but he would like to discuss them with the cabinet minister.\n\nThere have been previous claims that Charles was trying to \u201cmeddle\u201d in government policy which he should not be doing as a member of the Royal Family.\nIn the February 2002 letter to Lord Irvine, who as lord chancellor was a senior legal aide to Mr Blair, Charles said he had previously written outlining his concerns over what he called an \u201cincreasing litigiousness\u201d in UK society.\nSome detail of the correspondence has been leaked previously.\nIn the full letter \u2013 which the former Prince of Wales himself calls \u201crather over-long\u201d - he expresses concern over \u201cextreme examples of litigation\u201d and \u201cbureaucratic red tape\u201d.\nHe wrote: \u201cThe more I have thought about this group of issues, the more convinced I am that we are heading for increasing difficulty in many walks of life.\"\nHe identified problem areas, including social care volunteers unable to deliver hot meals, elderly people in care homes unable to open fire doors as they are too heavy, and infrequent live-firing training for soldiers.\n\u201cI am in little doubt that in the broadest sense, the proliferation of rules and rights, makes people overcautious, stifles initiative and acts as a brake on creative thinking,\" he said. \n\u201cThe armed forces are an important example. Armies fight as they train. If you wish to do well in high-intensity war-fighting, you must also train at a high level of intensity. \n\"But because modern safety precautions are so strict, live-firing exercises happen with much less frequency than they used to\u201d.\n\nOn care volunteers, he said: \u201cThe law now prevents volunteers cooking meals for residents at home, and then transporting them to the resident\u2019s home to be reheated. It also prevents them from cooking meals in old people's homes unless they have undertaken a food hygiene course.\n\u201cYet many of these sorts of volunteers are middle-aged ladies who have cooked for their families for 40 years without poisoning anyone.\n\u201cIn order to protect the elderly from a tiny, but theoretical risk, a whole section of volunteers is in danger of being alienated.\n\u201cThose who institute the rules sometimes seem so evidently not to know what they are talking about.\"\nCharles added: \u201cI would not want you to think for a moment that I would argue against sensible ways to protect the interests of individuals and society from harm, irresponsibility and unfairness.\"\n\nHe ends the letter to the law officer saying he looked forward to having the opportunity to \u201ctalk through the issues more privately in more detail\u201d.\nIt is not known if he did discuss the issues with Lord Irvine.\nIn 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that other private letters sent by Charles to Labour ministers between September 2004 and April 2005 could be published by media outlets.  \nIn one letter to Mr Blair, the then prince said the armed forces were being asked to do a challenging job \"without the necessary resources\".\nUnder this legal ruling, 27 letters to seven government departments on wide-ranging subjects, including the dominance of supermarkets, badger culling and the herbal medicine sector, were published.\nA UK government veto on publication was declared unlawful by the Court of Appeal last year - a decision which was upheld by the Supreme Court in March 2015.\nYou can find the 2002 letter on the National Archive website.\nWe have known for years that Charles, when he was Prince of Wales, was not shy in coming forward to express his views to UK government ministers.\nFor some, it overstepped a constitutional line. For others, it was seen as a positive that he cared enough about certain issues to raise them with politicians.\nWhat strikes me from this letter is that Charles fully realised that his comments and involvement might not go down well, after being warned as such by Tony Blair.\nIt does make you wonder what we will find out in 20 years, after all the recent political turbulence.\nWhat sort of correspondence will we discover between Prince Charles and numerous Conservative prime ministers?\nAnd what sort of correspondence between King Charles and Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, as well as the new Labour government under Keir Starmer?",
    "An \u00a311m health hub in a Derbyshire town is due to open on 23 September.\nNewholme Health Centre, in Bakewell, will include an ambulance station and provide NHS outpatient services like physiotherapy and audiology.\nIt has been built on the site of a former ambulance station and the neighbouring Newholme Hospital, which is due to be decommissioned.\nJim Austin, from Derbyshire Community Health Services (DCHS) NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"We are very excited about opening up the facility.\n\"It's great that the citizens of Derbyshire will get the very latest technology and environment for treatment.\"\nThe hub will also provide children's services, complex wound care, muscular and skeletal services, and various other clinics.\nServices which are still running at the old Newholme Hospital will move to the new centre when it opens.\nMr Austin said: \"In essence, the services provided won't be any different from the old site, but they're in a much more suitable setting. \n\"Given that the old hospital was over 100 years old... moving to the new building will ensure all our physicians and patients are in the very best setting meeting all the latest environmental stances as well.\n\"It's a much more suitable building than the one we've had to leave.\"\nThe health centre is a joint development by DCHS and East Midlands Ambulance Services NHS Trust (EMAS).\nCraig Whyles, divisional director for Derbyshire at EMAS, said: \u201cIt is a really exciting moment to see the last few years of hard work come together in the opening of Newholme Health Centre.\n\u201cThe new building and its modern facilities will be such an improvement on our old ambulance station and by physically sharing a space together, it will undoubtedly build on our relationships and understanding of one another\u2019s organisations.\"\nThe Department of Health and Social Care awarded the project \u00a38.58m in funding in December 2018 as part of the government\u2019s Sustainability and Transformation Partnership drive. \nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Two people have been arrested after minor clashes between two groups of demonstrators in Barnsley town centre on Thursday. \nThere was a heavy police presence in the area during what South Yorkshire Police described as \"a largely peaceful gathering\" involving about 110 people.\nThe force said a 43-year-old man had been taken into custody on suspicion of possession of a banned breed of dog and possession of a controlled drug and a 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon. \nThey both remained in police custody, the force added.\nThe force confirmed additional police powers had been authorised in Wombwell and Barnsley town centre on Thursday. \nOfficers could now disperse people from those areas to \"help minimise crime and disorder\" and had enhanced powers to stop and search individuals, it said. \nThey also had the power to tell people to remove face coverings. \nAssistant Chief Constable Rick Alton said: \"These police powers allow our officers to monitor situations and reduce a risk of further violence or disorder.\"\nHe said additional powers had been placed in Sheffield on Wednesday to allow officers to keep the public and themselves safe, but the day had passed \"largely without incident\".\nHowever, he warned that police were \"still coming after those responsible\" for the  disorder in Rotherham at the weekend, with officers \"knocking down doors\".\n\"We are continuing to come for you and you will be brought to justice for the horror you have caused,\" he said.\nSouth Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard said the county felt \"relatively calm\" now but he still had concerns. \n\"It's having a very significant impact on day-to-day policing,\" Mr Coppard told the BBC. \n\"There are police officers who have had their leave cancelled, their shifts extended, they are spending a significant amount of time away from their familis and that is because we have seen significant amounts of violence on the streets of South Yorkshire.\"\nHe said the blame for that was \"squarely on the people who perpetrated that violence\" at the Holiday Inn Express in Manvers on Sunday. \n\"Anybody that is considering taking violence to our streets should think again,\" Mr Coppard added.\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Tim Walz touted his rural roots and said Donald Trump would take the US \"backwards\" as he appeared for the first time as Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate at a raucous Democratic Party rally.\nAt the event in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, the party\u2019s new nominee for vice-president said their Republican rivals in November's election were \"weird as hell\".\nThe Minnesota governor spoke in front of thousands of supporters just hours after he was announced as Ms Harris\u2019s pick for the role.\nThe Trump campaign, meanwhile, was quick to attack Mr Walz as a \"dangerously liberal extremist\".\nThe 60-year-old is billed as someone who could win back rural and working-class voters who have gravitated to Donald Trump in crucial midwestern states.\nAt the rally in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, Ms Harris, currently the US vice-president, said she and Mr Walz were the \"underdogs\" in what is expected to be a close election but had the momentum.\nShe introduced her running mate as \u201ca fighter for the middle class, a patriot\u201d.\nMr Walz then recounted his small-town roots in Nebraska and his career as a national guardsman and teacher, before attempting to draw a contrast with Trump.\n\"He doesn\u2019t know the first thing about service - because he's too busy serving himself,\" said the former army sergeant and football coach.\nHe got some of the loudest cheers of the night when he took aim at the former president's criminal record, with chants of \u201clock him up\u201d from those in the arena.\nHe also sparked applause when he invoked a viral attack line that caught the eye of the Harris campaign as she considered who would be her running mate.\n\"These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell,\" Mr Walz said of their Republican challengers. \nThe pair mostly pitched themselves as defenders of individual freedoms, including on abortion rights and safety from gun violence.\nMr Walz showed the plain-spoken, folksy style that has won praise from Democrats, as he took a jab at Republicans on the issue of abortion access.\n\u201cMind your own damn business!\" he said, drawing an ovation from the crowd of more than 10,000 at Temple University.\nMs Harris and Mr Walz have just launched a five-day tour of key battleground states.\nThey will also speak at the Democratic National Convention, which runs from 19 to 22 August in Chicago.\nAs the current two-term governor of Minnesota, Mr Walz has overseen one of the most productive legislative periods in state history, implementing a sweeping left-wing agenda.\nDemocrats have used control of the state legislature to guarantee abortion rights, pass gun control measures and institute paid family leave.\nA source close to the Harris VP selection process told CBS News that his list of accomplishments for working families matched what Harris wants to do nationally.\nBut Republicans have criticised Mr Walz for Minnesota's mask mandate and a shutdown of businesses and schools during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as his delay in deploying the National Guard to deal with rioting after George Floyd's murder in 2020.\nTrump called into Fox and Friends on Fox News on Wednesday and said he \"never thought\" Ms Harris would choose Mr Walz as her running mate - who he dubbed as \"very, very liberal\". \nH said he is \"thrilled\" about the decision, suggesting it would be easy to go after his political record. \n\"You know, nobody knew how radical left she was, but he's a smarter version of her,\" he said, comparing the Minnesota governor to Bernie Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator.\nAlso in Philadelphia earlier on Tuesday was Mr Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, who assailed the new Democratic White House ticket.\nThe Ohio senator told reporters that Ms Harris\u2019s choice of Mr Walz shows that \"when given the opportunity she will bend the knee to the most radical elements of her party\".\nPresident Joe Biden, who suspended his own election campaign last month and endorsed Ms Harris, said in a statement that the Democratic ticket \"will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy\".\nAnother of the finalists to be Ms Harris\u2019s running mate, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, was also at the rally.\nHe had faced sharp criticism from the left over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza.\nSome Trump advisers have expressed relief that Ms Harris did not pick Mr Shapiro because of concerns he could help deliver the pivotal state of Pennsylvania.\nOn Wednesday on Fox, Trump suggested that not picking Mr Shapiro was \"very insulting to Jewish people\". \nBefore entering the governor's office, Mr Walz represented a Republican-leaning district in the US Congress for 12 years.\nHe won that seat in 2006 - the only Democrat to have done so in the mostly rural district over the past three decades.\nMr Walz is a native of Nebraska and the son of a school administrator and a stay-at-home mother.\nHe grew up farming and hunting and served in the Army National Guard for 24 years after joining aged 17.\nThe young Mr",
    "After enduring years of gruelling treatment for cancer as a child, Teifi Rowley was left self-conscious about their appearance and uncomfortable in their own skin. \nBut performing as drag alter ego Anniben has been a way of processing trauma and finding empowerment.\n\"It's really been a saviour for me,\" said Teifi.\nTeifi was diagnosed with a tumour behind the eye at the age of six and spent a year as an inpatient in hospital, facing numerous rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. \nNow 21, they were finally discharged from their paediatric oncologist clinic in March.\n\"I've had some severe body dysmorphia... half my face looks different now, on one side I've got a flatter face, no eyebrow, my eye is sunken and my lip is like kind of more pushed one way,\" they said. \n\"But with the make-up and the drag I can control how my face looks so I can eliminate these imperfections, if you want us to call them that, or I can lean into it and make more of a spectacle of it and make it kind of a badge of honour.\"\nAnniben, which means messy in Welsh, was a character Teifi began drawing when studying art at college.\n\"It was like a weird, clowny character with kind of sunken eyes, and then a big red nose,\" they said.\n\"I thought \u2018you look kind of ill and sickly\u2019  and then it kind of clicked,\" they said, adding it was \"some sort of repressed trauma coming out\". \nThen one day Teifi decided to use make-up to transform themselves into Anniben.  \n\"I just realised that it was a really cool coping mechanism for me,\" they said.\n\"It's really helped me a lot.\"\nTeifi, who describes androgynous Anniben as a \"drag thing\", said their performances were conceptual and unlike the cabaret style performances typical of drag queens.\n\"They're gender fluid weirdness with a splash of camp, a splash of horror maybe and then just a lot of high energy and storytelling,\" Teifi said. \nDuring one performance Anniben fell in love with a cake and in another, inspired by the fantasy film Pan's Labyrinth, they had a \"queer awakening\" and became a monster with eyeballs in the palms of their hands.\nTeifi, who performs in both English and Welsh, said they felt \"privileged\" to be part of a small scene of Welsh-speaking drag acts in Cardiff.\n\"It's really lovely to see queerness and Welshness bridging,\" they said. \nPerforming as Anniben has also been a way for Teifi to explore their own gender identity.\n\"The majority of my life I have been identifying as a gay male but in the past couple of years, and fairly recently, I've been questioning my own gender identity,\" said Teifi.\n\"I don't think I'm a man but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a woman either.\n\"When I present myself as this kind of androgynous character, I feel really myself so I was like, \u2018why don't I feel like that out of the makeup and stuff?'\"\nToday Teifi identifies as \"queer\" and prefers the pronouns they/ them.\n\"As a blanket term queer suits me well because I don't really know where I am on the spectrum,\" they said. \nTeifi no longer has to see an oncologist but still lives with the legacy of cancer.  \nOn discharge they were advised to prioritise their health.\n\"I don't drink as much anymore, I don't really stay out late, I'm eating better, so it\u2019s made me push myself healthily in a good way,\" they said. \nTeifi said as a result of chemotherapy some of their teeth had not grown properly so they were hoping to get reconstructive dental surgery.\nThe months since being discharged have been emotional. \n\"It wasn\u2019t until fairly recently that I've understood more about what I went through, and it's kind of been a bit traumatic to be honest,\" said Teifi. \n\"I remember being around other children who looked so poorly and a few of them passed away when I was there but I was so young I didn't really understand what was going on at the time.\"\nTeifi said the experience had giving them perspective. \n\"Realising how close I was to not being here and how severe it was makes me immensely grateful that it was caught when it was and I'm still here today prancing around being a weirdo,\" they laughed.\n\"I have a nicer, richer outlook on life, taking everything as it is and pushing whatever I want to do, and doing it.\"",
    "London's Bangladeshi community have been celebrating following the ousting of Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. \nMs Hasina fled the country following weeks of deadly student-led protests against her regime which she led with an iron fist.\n\"We must never forget the people that gave their lives trying to get this movement off the ground,\" said Canning Town resident and civil servant Shumena Akhter. \nEvents took place across east London with hundreds gathering in Altab Ali park and outside East London Mosque in Whitechapel.\nEast London, specifically Tower Hamlets, is the home of Britain's largest Bangladeshi community. According to the 2021 census, 34.7% of the population identifies as Bangladeshi or British Bangladeshi. \nIn Altab Ali park on Monday people gathered to sing, dance and wave flags to mark Ms Hasina's fall from power. \nAn effigy of the former Prime Minister, constructed from a helium balloon and the torso of a clothes mannequin, was attached to a telegraph pole in the middle of the park. In one video from the celebrations a man can be seen hitting the effigy with his shoe. \nWeeks of civil disobedience in Bangladesh toppled Ms Hasina's 15 years in power. \nProtests began in early July when university students took to the streets in peaceful demonstrations against civil service job quotas. The protests soon transformed into a wider anti-government movement. \nAs the movement expanded so too did the brutality of the police and government response, with reports of more than 300 people killed in the unrest. \nDespite Ms Hasina reportedly cutting off internet access in parts of the country, the media blackout didn't stop images and videos of the situation appearing on social media - alerting the international community to the escalating bloodshed. \nShumena Akhter, 27, said she saw the gatherings on social media and that it was great to see everyone come together, especially so many young people. \n\"I think it's beautiful that people are now celebrating Bangladesh in a way that we should have always\" she said. \n\"But it's a moment of fleeting joy because there is so much that has to change. \n\"The voices of students need to be included in the changes within Bangladesh's government going forward.\n\"Young people want to be involved.\"\nSpeaking about the reaction of Bangladesh's diaspora community to the former Prime Minister fleeing the country, Ms Akhter said: \"She held onto her position for so long partly because of her legacy as the daughter of the founder of Bangladesh but she hasn't done justice to that.\n\"As diaspora there is an emotional connection to Bangladesh but we're not always informed of the situation.\"\n\"The main thing anyone within diaspora can do is educate themselves and gain greater awareness.\"\nMs Akhter said she was shocked when she went to visit Bangladesh two years ago to see that her cousins had been unable to find work.  \nShe said: \"They have masters degrees and have completed higher education but there are no opportunities for them despite them having worked so hard.\" \nNabeela Zaman, 27, is the managing director of the British Bangla Welfare Trust, an independent charity in Stratford. \nShe said her charities works with volunteers - mostly students - in Bangladesh who were directly impacted by and involved in the unrest. \n\"They're safe now\", she said. \n\"But it was a fearful time, it was difficult to find out what was even happening on the ground because of internet shutdowns.\n\"I am hopeful about the future, what the students managed to achieve in a short amount of time is nothing short of revolutionary,\" she added. \nMs Zaman was also at Altab Ali park.\n\"It was really joyful, everyone was singing and there were a lot of people.\n\"It was nice to be in an atmosphere where everyone was happy after seeing so much bloodshed,\" she said.\n\"After everything that's happened it was really nice to see everyone happy and coming together for a celebration.\"\nSpeaking about why people chose to gather there she said: \"For British Bangladeshis it's a historical landmark... it was bittersweet to be holding the celebration there.\"\nThe park was renamed to honour Bangladeshi textile worker Altab Ali after he was murdered by racists there in 1978. \nIn a statement, Mohammad Nuruzzaman from Newham Muslim Forum said the speed with which events unfolded in Bangladesh was unprecedented. \n\"None of us thought the situation could change so quickly,\" he said. \n\"We've been supporting members of our communities worried about their relatives, which has been especially difficult with the internet blackouts. Sometimes we've not heard from close relatives for days.\n\"Since Monday, there has been an outpouring of joy and euphoria.

    "Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned after weeks of deadly anti-government protests, putting an end to her more than two decades dominating  the country's politics. \nMs Hasina, 76, fled the country, reportedly landing in India on Monday. \nJubilant crowds took to the streets to celebrate the news, with some storming the prime ministerial palace, reportedly looting and vandalising parts of her former residence. \nHours after Ms Hasina's resignation, President Mohammed Shahabuddin ordered the release of jailed former prime minister Khaleda Zia and all students detained during recent protests against a quota system for government jobs.\nPresident Shahabuddin said he had chaired a meeting of army chiefs and political representatives. \nHe said an interim government would be formed, new elections called and a national curfew lifted.\nIn Dhaka on Monday, police and other government buildings were attacked and set on fire. Protesters attempted to tear down a statue of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Ms Hasina's father.\nArmy and police units were deployed across the city. Mobile phone service was reportedly cut off for several hours before being restored. \nProtesters were seen carrying out furniture from the prime minister's residence. \nDozens were reported killed, although the precise toll remained unclear. The AFP news agency reported the toll as 66 dead, though local outlet the Dhaka Tribune said as many as 135 had been killed. \nMs Hasina's departure leaves a vacuum in Bangladeshi politics, which has long been characterised by a rivalry between her Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. \nThe country has experienced several military coups, most recently in 2007.\nThe US commended the army for its \"restraint\" and said an interim government should be formed. The EU urged an \"orderly and peaceful transition\" towards a democratically elected government.\nThere was no official reaction from neighbour and regional power India. \nDebapriya Bhattacharya, a senior economist with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka, told the BBC that while the resignation had been met with \"euphoria\" in the streets, attacks on the Hindu minority had escalated, posing an immediate challenge to the new authorities. \n\"There is a feeling that India completely backed Sheikh Hasina's government. Protesters make no distinction between India and Hindu citizens of Bangladesh, which has already led to attacks on temples and people.\n\"Now there is a power vacuum, there is nobody to implement law and order. The new government will need to protect religious minorities.\"\nMs Hasina's allies said she would not return to the country's politics. The former prime minister has spent a total of 20 years in office, first coming to power in 1996. \nHer son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC's Newshour programme: \"She\u2019s in her late 70s. She is so disappointed that after all her hard work, for a minority to rise up against her, I think she\u2019s done. \n\"My family and I are done.\"\nCritics say Ms Hasina's rule was characterised by forced disappearances, extra-judicial killings and the crushing of opposition figures and government critics. \nBut Mr Wazed, who also served as a adviser to the prime minister on technology, defended his mother's record. \n\"She has turned Bangladesh around in the last 15 years. \n\"When she took over power, it was considered a failing state. It was a poor country. \n\"Until today, it was considered one of the rising tigers of Asia.\"\nAbout 300 people have been killed since protests broke out a month ago over a quota system for government jobs. The demonstrations, met with harsh repression by government forces, developed into a broader anti-government movement. \nDr Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House think tank, said the country's high unemployment rates had made the quotas, which reserved a third of civil service jobs for descendants of veterans of the country's 1971 independence war with Pakistan, a particularly salient political issue. \n\"Public sector job quotas \u2013 with 400,000 new graduates competing for 3,000 civil service jobs \u2013 became a lightning rod for anti-government unrest,\" Dr Bajpaee said.\nHe added that the speed of events reflected frustration among Bangladeshi youth over the country\u2019s \"one-party rule\" over the last 15 years. \n\"In a country with such a vibrant civil society, efforts to curb political freedoms and free speech were bound to trigger a blowback.\"\nMost of the quota was scaled back by the government following a Supreme Court ruling last month, but students continued to protest, demanding justice for those killed and injured, and Ms Hasina' resignation. \nMr Bhattacharya said protesters now expected the new government to go through with their demands, including democratic reforms, better jobs and improvements to the education system.",

    "The Badger Trust has mounted a legal challenge against the granting of new culling licences.\nThe charity argues Natural England ignored the advice of its own scientific experts in allowing the measure to go ahead in areas including Dorset, Wiltshire and Oxfordshire.\nThe cull is aimed at reducing the spread of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) but there is a growing call to support further evaluations of community-led badger vaccination.\nNatural England said it could not comment on legal action.\nThe badger culling programme began 11 years ago. By next year it is likely to have cost the lives of 250,000 of the animals, costing the UK taxpayer more than \u00a3100m.\nIt remains a controversial weapon in the important battle to keep cows free of a disease that puts them and humans at risk.\nThis year licences have been renewed for four sites - two in Dorset and two in Wiltshire.\nTwo new areas have also been approved in Oxfordshire and Wiltshire.\nAcross all six sites a total of between 801 and 6,674 badgers can be culled.\nThe Sussex-based Badger Trust is taking legal action of the way Natural England reached its decision on the licences.\nIt believes vaccination of badgers should be used instead.\nPeter Hambly, executive director of the Badger's Trust, said Natural England's own head of science had asserted this supplementary cull should not go ahead.\n\"Natural England and Defra stated that they are going ahead because they don't want to upset the farming lobby,\" he said.\n\"Thirty thousand badgers have been targeted for slaughter over the country, including thousands in places like Oxfordshire and Dorset.\"\nIn coming to its decision on licences, Natural England did outline to the government that there is \"sound evidence\" that badger vaccination can be used as an alternative to culling, and that it is still committed to ending the cull as its main control measure by 2026. \nBut Natural England said it was not yet ready to be rolled out everywhere, partly because of a lack of trained personnel. \nThe fear is leaving a gap as a switch is made between one main measure of control to another. \nThe BBC has spoken to several farmers who did not want to be formally interviewed  but said they all felt it was \"too soon\" to end culling.\nThe National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Tom Bradshaw said: \"The current government strategy to control and eradicate bTB, which gives farmers access to multiple measures to tackle the disease, has been hugely successful.\"\n\"New data in the Birch Review provided further evidence of this, demonstrating the herd incidence rate of TB reduced by 56% in areas that have had four or more years of wildlife control,\" he added.\n\u201cThe NFU will continue to work with its members and government to ensure a successful strategy to eradicate bTB continues to be based on sound science and evidence.\u201d\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "Dozens of people have reportedly been killed in Israeli air strikes on two schools in Gaza, according to Palestinian rescuers and news outlets.\nSome of those killed were displaced people sheltering at the schools, rescuers said.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the strikes, saying it had targeted Hamas \"command and control centres\" within two schools in Gaza City.\nThe strikes were the third time in a week schools in Gaza have been hit by Israeli strikes. \nThe IDF said: \"The schools were used by Hamas's al-Furqan Battalion as a hiding place for its terrorist operatives and as command centres used to plan and execute attacks against IDF troops and the state of Israel.\"\nFootage on social media purported to show bodies inside one of the schools as rescuers evacuated casualties, including children.\nPalestinian media said at least 30 people were killed in the strikes. Mahmoud Basal, a spokesman for the Palestinian Civil Defence, said most of the dead were women and children.\nHe added that more people were believed to be buried under the rubble.\nThe attack on the al-Nasr and Hassan Salama schools came on the day of an attack on a camp for displaced people in a hospital in central Gaza, which reportedly killed at least five people. \nOn Saturday, officials said an air strike on Hamama School in Gaza City had killed at least 17 people. \nDays earlier, a strike on Dalal al-Mughrabi School killed 15, according to officials.\nThe IDF says it takes care to minimise risk to civilians when conducting strikes but the Palestinian Civil Defence described Sunday's attacks as \"a massacre\". \nIn a separate development on Sunday morning, two people were killed in a stabbing attack in the Israeli city of Holon. The Palestinian attacker was later shot dead, police said.\nThe Israel-Gaza war began on 7 October, when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.\nThe attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,480 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "\u201cBefore I went into care I didn\u2019t really have many goals because with my home life, there was no stability.\"\nThose are the words of 19-year-old Naomi Bright from west Belfast.\nShe left school with two GCSEs as, she feels, she was not pushed or motivated her in the right direction.\nNow, she's one of a handful of students who have been taking part in a new short course at Ulster University (UU) which is designed to help encourage those who have had experience of early adversity attend university.\nFigures from the Department of Education's annual school census for Northern Ireland for 2002-23 show that 28.7% of children in the care system stayed on in school from year 12 to year 13 compared to 64.8% for other children.\nSome 73.5% of children in care left the school system with at least five GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) compared with 90.0% of other children.\nAlso 12.4% of children in care, who left the school system in 2022/23, were recorded as going to Higher Education and 46.8% as going to Further Education.\nThe figures for other children were 41.7% for Higher Education and 30.2%  for Further Education.\nThe Early Adversity and Developmental Trauma course in UU's School of Psychology is the first course of its kind in Northern Ireland. \nIt aims to help attendees pursue a career in psychology, community work or social work.\nResearch carried out last year by the Institute for the Study of Civil Society found care leavers are three times less likely than their non-care experienced peers to go to university.\nThe course's director and psychologist Dominic McSherry has conducted research in the area of child adolescent trauma.\nHe said the reason that children come into care is due to some form of adversity, which can harm their development and capacity to learn whenever they go to school.\n\"A lot of that is to do with the fact that whenever children come into care there is a lot of disruption,\" he explained.\n\"Possibly if they come into a foster placement they will have to move school, and then maybe whenever they are in foster care they may have to move maybe one or two times,\" he added.\nHe said the constant changes can be \"very disruptive\" for their education.\nEsla Ibrahim, 19, from north Belfast, passed her GCSEs and went into care when she was in sixth form. \nShe dropped out of school a few months later.\nAfter a break, she returned to education, did her A levels at Belfast Met and is now awaiting her results.\nShe is also taking part in the course in the hopes of pursuing a career as a research psychologist or forensic psychologist.\nShe believes there needs to be more support for young people who come from a care-experienced background in education.\n\"I think they should be doing more for young people in showing them the importance of education and that their experiences don\u2019t define them,\" she said.\n\"Just because their experience is a bit different than other young people who haven\u2019t come into care, it doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t get an education and that they aren\u2019t smart enough,\" she added.\nAfter leaving school, Naomi Bright became involved with an organisation which allowed her to gain some qualifications to get into youth work and mentoring.\nShe now works in youth work and plans to continue studying.\n\"University wouldn\u2019t have been something I would have thought of before getting involved in this course. This course has changed that.\n\"Now I would. I definitely have goals now,\" she said.\nThe Department of Health said a joint strategy with the Department of Education,  published in 2021, recognises the importance of education in improving life outcomes for care-experienced children and young people. \nA dedicated primary age children looked after service has been put in place and work is ongoing across both departments to ensure that every child in care has an individually tailored care plan covering all aspects of their wellbeing, including their education.\nThe Adoption and Children Act in Northern Ireland was also introduced in 2022 and recognises that care-experienced children and young people often experience poorer educational outcomes than their peers. \nIt requires Health and Social Care trusts to promote and support the learning, development and educational achievement of children who are looked after. \nCare leavers aged between 21 and 25 are also be able to apply for further assistance to pursue a new course of education or training or to request advice and support. \nThis advice or support may continue beyond age 25 if a health trust considers it is needed.\nThe Department for Economy said it was committed to removing barriers to educational and economic inclusion, recognising that care-experienced young people often face additional challenges to their peers.",
    "The first therapy that uses gene-editing is to be offered on the NHS in a \u201crevolutionary breakthrough\u201d for patients.\nIt will be used as a potential cure for the blood disorder beta thalassaemia.\nStem cells which make blood will be extracted, reprogrammed to correct the condition and returned to the patient's body. \nIt could spare them needing a blood transfusion, every three to five weeks, for life.\nPeople with beta thalassaemia struggle to produce enough haemoglobin, which is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body.\nIt is a genetic disease that is passed down through families and caused by defects in the body's instructions for manufacturing haemoglobin.  \nIt can leave people severely tired, weak, and short of breath and also cuts life expectancy.\nKirthana Balachandran, 21, was diagnosed when she was only three months old and gets muscle pain and back pain and can have palpitations when walking uphill.\n\u201cThe idea of depending on transfusions for quite literally the rest of my life is daunting, I constantly worry about the future,\u201d she says.\nThe idea of gene-editing is you only need to do it once.\nIt relies on a tool called Crispr, which won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2020. It is essentially a satnav connected to a pair of scissors \u2013 one part targets the right section of DNA and the other performs the edit.\nYou might think this technology is being used to repair the genetic defect, but it is actually cuter than that. \nInstead it relies on the fact your body makes different types of haemoglobin before and after birth.\nWhen we are still in the womb, our bodies use \"fetal haemoglobin\" to pull oxygen out of our mother's bloodstream.\nOnce we are born, a genetic switch is flipped and we start making \"adult haemoglobin\". \nCrucially, it is only the adult form of haemoglobin that is affected by beta thalassaemia.\nSo the therapy disables the switch - named BCL11A \u2013 so the adult body starts making fetal haemoglobin once again. \nIn order to do this, the stem cells that manufacture red blood cells in our spongy bone marrow are harvested.\nThese cells are sent to the lab where the genetic switch is targeted.\nThe next stage is unpleasant. It takes a course of chemotherapy to kill off the old stem cells that were producing broken haemoglobin, before the new ones can be put in.\nAbdul-Qadeer Akhtar, 28 and from Hemel Hempstead, took part in clinical trials in 2020.\nHe said the treatment was \u201cchallenging\u201d and \u201ctough\u201d but since having it, he has been \u201chealthier and more active\u201d.\n\u201c[I] have even taken up boxing, I can travel more freely now, which is fantastic, I\u2019m eager to embrace life to the fullest.\u201d\nData shows that out of 52 patients given the treatment, 49 did not need another blood transfusion for at least a year of monitoring. The approach is so new that the long-term effects are still unknown. \nKirthana says: \u201cWith gene therapy, I would potentially have a cure, and not have to have my three-weekly transfusions.\n\u201cIt would be a life-changing treatment.\u201d\nThe National Institute of Health and Care Excellence medicines watchdog has approved the therapy after assessing the costs and benefits of what it calls a \u201cpotential cure\u201d.\nA deal has been struck which means NHS England is paying less than the official price of \u00a31.6m per patient.\nIt is estimated that 460 people over the age of 12 would be eligible if they wanted the therapy, and it will be offered at seven specialist centres \u201cwithin weeks\u201d.\nAmanda Pritchard, the NHS chief executive, said: \u201cThis is a historic moment for people living with beta thalassaemia with a potential cure for those facing this debilitating disorder now available on the NHS.\u201d\nBeta thalassemia mainly affects people of Mediterranean, south Asian, south-east Asian and Middle Eastern backgrounds.\nPreviously the only alternative to blood transfusions was a stem cell transplant, but this was rare because it required a very close tissue match from a donor. \nCasgevy, developed by the company Vertex, is the first approved therapy to use Crispr-technology.\nRomaine Maharaj, executive director of the UK Thalassaemia Society, said \u201cwe stand on the brink of a revolutionary breakthrough\u201d and \u201cit is a beacon of hope\u201d.\nNegotiations are still under way to see if the same therapy can be used on the NHS for another genetic disease affecting haemoglobin - sickle cell anaemia. \n",

    "British gymnast Becky Downie is holding her head high despite missing out on the medal she hoped for at the Paris Olympics.\nThe 32-year-old, from Nottingham, competed at her first games since Rio 2016 and shone on the uneven bars in the women's qualifying gymnastics. \nBut in the team final on the 30 July, she narrowly missed a team medal.\nDespite her disappointment, she told the BBC that the changes she fought for in the sport meant \"more than any medal\" and that she was looking forward to a rest. \nMs Downie's final uneven bars routine was interrupted when she fell midway through, but she quickly recovered and completed it. \nSpeaking about missing out on the medal, she said: \"It's something that I've worked my whole life for, and I genuinely couldn't have felt any more ready for that day. \n\"I felt really prepared, training had been going really well.\" \nShe added: \"When I watched the replay, that's what I think made it worse because I didn't really feel like I was off until I was off, and when I saw the replay and my hands were fully on the bar, I said 'I don't even know how this has happened'.\"\nBut looking back at her performances throughout the games and being \"back on a world stage\", Ms Downie was pleased she could prove she \"wasn't ever not good anymore\". \nHer Olympic return had followed a \"difficult\" few years, for a number of reasons. Ms Downie and her gymnast sister Ellie, lost their 24-year-old brother a week before the Tokyo Olympic trials. \nThe pair's individual careers had also faced \"consequences\" they did not expect, Ms Downie said, after their whistleblowing about abuses in the sport - which eventually helped to transform it. \n\"At the time, we didn't quite think it would come with the consequences that it did, but 100% for both of us, we didn't regret the decision, and the changes that we have seen since and are continuing to see are just really encouraging and really positive,\" she said. \nTo her and her sister - who were both appointed MBEs for their services to gymnastics and to gymnasts - those changes meant \"more than any other medal could\", she added. \nAnd despite missing out on the medal, Ms Downie - a two-time Commonwealth Games and three-time European Championship gold medal winner - said she \"enjoyed every minute\" of being part of the event. \nNow, though, after having spent no more than four to six weeks outside of the gym throughout her entire career, Ms Downie said she was looking forward to \"relaxing and seeing what opportunities come up\". \nShe said: \"For future Becky, I really want to coach.\n\"Me and Ellie have spoken about - as long-term plans - about having our own gym. \n\"There's a lot of cool ideas, and I feel like I have so much to give back.\" \nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Baby beavers have been born in urban London for the first time in more than 400 years, a conservation project said.\nThe family of Eurasian beavers were introduced to a nature reserve in Ealing, west London, in October as part of a project that aims to get the public to engage with nature, to study biodiversity improvements and to monitor flood mitigation effects.\nProject leaders said the fact that at least two babies, or kits as they are called, had been born on the Paradise Fields site in Greenford showed the beavers were \"happy\" with the habitat.\nDr Sean McCormack, one of the volunteers behind the project, said he and the other volunteers were \"totally over the moon, thrilled, excited\".\nHe said it proved beavers and Londoners could live side by side.\n\"There's easy fixes to living alongside beavers, we are just afraid of the unknown, we are afraid of change. We haven't lived alongside beavers for 400 years,\" he said.\n\"In urban London we are talking about these kits, the first beavers born in urban London for over 400 years. But arguably are these the first kits ever born in urban London?\"\nDr McCormack said he had \"a suspicion\" that there could be babies at the reserve and when he reviewed footage, he discovered the beavers' offspring. \n\"It was a real thrill to look at the camera footage and suddenly see this tiny miniature beaver, very very cute, playing with mum on 30 June,\" he said.\n\"We have kept it a little bit quiet to settle in and everything. We believe there's two, there could me more but we have seen two together. \n\"It's testament to the project's success that the beavers are happy enough to breed and continue raise a family here.\"\nNadya Mirochnitchenko, the ecologist for Ealing Beaver Project, said they wanted to  educate people about beavers and \"about how we can live with beavers in harmony\".\n\"And this is just a positive message,\" she said. \n\"This is an urban site, where people have access to it and the beavers can also thrive as well.\"\nThe site is right next to a retail park and a fast food drive-through. It is surrounded on all sides by roads and buildings. But in this small, green oasis the beavers have made their home. \nThere are six dams and two lodges. The dams hold back the water and have created larger lagoons. Part of the project was to assess if beavers can help with flood mitigation.\nVolunteers from the Ealing Beaver Project showed us around the site. It is very clear that the beavers have been busy. Trees have been gnawed and felled and the water levels are much higher than when we visited previously. Six dams and two lodges have been created by the beavers.\nEurope has been introducing beavers for decades, and the Ealing project hopes other UK cities and towns will follow suit.\n\"We may need to learn to live alongside them again, and sometimes manage their behaviour, but the ecosystem services they provide have been clearly demonstrated here already at the Ealing Beaver Project,\" said Dr McCormack.\n\"Improved water quality, reduced flooding, more insects and other wildlife on site, habitat improvements.

    "There are few people who have become more synonymous with the 2024 Olympics than Snoop Dogg. \nWhen there is an American athlete vying for a medal in Paris, there is a camera ready to pan to the American rapper cheering in the stands.\nHe has been seen dancing alongside the US women's gymnastics team, dressing up in equestrian gear to support American horseback riders and even trying out judo skills.\nSnoop Dogg's enthusiasm for the games has injected a new energy into the Olympics that is captivating viewers in Paris and the internet alike, and making for a highly watched summer games, according to NBC viewership numbers.\nAfter multiple clips went viral from Snoop Dogg's time hosting a highlight show with comedian Kevin Hart on NBC's streaming platform Peacock during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 - the network gave the rapper an even bigger role in 2024: special correspondent. \nBut Snoop Dogg has seemingly taken the role to the next level becoming a cheerleader for American athletes regardless of the sport. \nHe started his games with an integral role: he was among the final torchbearers of the Olympic flame before the game's opening ceremony last week. \nThe 52-year-old, whose full name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, carried the torch through the streets of Saint-Denis in the north of Paris, home to the Stade de France Olympic Stadium.\nAnd while the role of special correspondent and his torch-bearing job were announced ahead of time, Snoop Dogg's consistent presence and high energy for the American athletes has been a special surprise for viewers. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by his popularity, but you never ever underestimate Snoop Dogg,\u201d Molly Solomon, NBC\u2019s executive producer of the Olympics, told reporters this week. \nShe described him as an \u201cambassador of happiness\u201d.\nWhen the US women's gymnastics team competed earlier this week, Snoop Dogg was dancing in the stands and sporting a t-shirt with Simone Biles' face on it.\nElsewhere in Paris, he has cheered on tennis star Coco Gauff and volleyball star Kelly Cheng, among countless others. \nHe got supporters excited about American track start Noah Lyles and sat alongside Lyles' mom days after the runner won Olympic gold. Snoop Dogg even affectionately refers to Lyles as nephew - a term used to convey his respect for the track star. \nOn Saturday, he joined American celebrity chef Martha Stewart - with whom he has a long friendship - in watching the equestrian events, while decked out in horse riding gear. \nHe participated in promotional judo event during the games where he was awarded an honorary black belt and got a swimming lesson from American-swimming great Michael Phelps. \nSome have suggested the rapper's presence has been a defining factor in better ratings.\nBeginning on 26 July, the day of the opening ceremony, the five-day total audience average was 34 million viewers when combining daytime and primetime coverage, an NBC Sports release said.\nThat is up 79% from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics where viewership suffered because of the pandemic. \nBut beyond the ratings and the internet coalescing, Snoop Dogg said he is just enjoying himself.\nNever \"in his wildest dreams\" did he expect to play this role in the Olympics, he told NBC Nightly News\u2019 Lester Holt in an interview recalling watching the Olympics on TV when he was younger.  \n\"I'm the biggest kid in the crowd,\" Snoop Dogg said.

    "About 2,000 counter-protesters took to the streets in Brighton for a peaceful protest, as police were on stand-by following anti-immigration unrest.\nAbout 500 people had gathered by about 19:00 BST with many more to follow during the evening. People carried Stand Up to Racism posters.\nThere were also anti-immigration protesters at the scene, but a BBC reporter said there were eight in total.\nAnti-racism campaigners also turned out in Hastings.

He admitted two charges of violent disorder at the city's magistrates' court. \nThe two boys were among dozens of people convicted on Monday following disorder that began after three young girls were killed in a knife attack in Southport. As of Monday, 975 people had been arrested and 546 had been charged, the National Police Chiefs' Council said.\nIn Liverpool, one of the 12-year-olds was caught on CCTV throwing the item at police and then riding off on a bicycle during a disturbance on 30 July. \nThe city's youth court was told the boy was the youngest person to appear before the courts in relation to unrest in Southport. \nHe was released on bail ahead of sentencing on 17 September. \nThe other 12-year-old was part of a group on 31July that gathered outside a Holiday Inn hotel housing asylum seekers, Manchester Magistrates' Court heard.\nThe prosecution said the boy, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, was seen in footage handing a rock to another youth during the disorder and was part of a group attack on a bus. \nHe was subsequently seen on 3 August filmed by police kicking the front window of a vape shop and throwing a missile at a police van, the prosecution told the court. \nThe boy was remanded to local authority accommodation and will be sentenced at Manchester Magistrates\u2019 Court on 2 September. \nIn Belfast, an 11-year-old boy has been charged with a number of offences in connection to disorder in the city last month. \nThe charges include throwing petrol bombs and causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury.\nAt Plymouth Crown Court, a man who grabbed a police officer's baton and ran off with it was jailed for three years. \nGuy Sullivan, 43, of New George Street, Plymouth, admitted a charge of violent disorder relating to the violence in the city on 5 August. \nThe court heard a lone officer had been using his baton to push back protesters around him, when Sullivan came behind the officer and grabbed the baton out of his hands. \nThe officer was then pulled to the ground and attacked by other protesters as onlookers filmed and shouted \u201cget him\u201d, \u201cdo him\u201d and \u201clet him have it\u201d.\nSentencing, judge Robert Linford said: \"You played your part in that mob violence.

    "Additional staff and \u00a3100m of funding is to be redirected to HMP Wandsworth following what the prisons' chief inspector called a \"catastrophic inspection\", the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has announced.\nCharlie Taylor's inspection in May found \"shocking condition\" and failures in leadership \"at every level\" at the south-west London prison.\nMy Taylor previously issued an \"urgent notification\" to the the then-Lord Chancellor and secretary of state for justice over the prison visit.\nOne former prisoner has described being jailed at Wandsworth as like \"a form of torture\".\nThe full report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons, which was released on Tuesday, found that 10 prisoners had taken their own lives since the previous inspection - seven of which had occurred in the past 12 months.\nRates of self-harm within the prison were also \"high and rising\", the report said, while 40% of emergency cell bells were not being answered within five minutes.\nDuring the inspection, staff were even oblivious to a prisoner in crisis who had self-harmed in his cell until inspectors brought the incident to their attention.\nDarrell, a former prisoner in Wandsworth, told BBC London the conditions in the jail were \"just horrendous\".\n\"For someone like me who has mental health conditions, yeah, it's very, very difficult, so the noise is a lot,\" he said.\n\"I believe that I do have a form of autism, and to be put in that environment is just like constant torture. [It] just made my mental health condition a lot, lot worse.\"\nThe report said 80% of men were sharing cells designed for one person.\nDarrell, who asked not to share his surname, said he was confined to his cell for 23 hours a day \"basically going insane\".\nHe said the cells often lacked basic facilities such as a cover around the toilet and a chair to sit on. They also had poor ventilation and often got \"very hot\".\n\"You're in there for eight months in a row dripping with sweat constantly - it's a form of torture,\" he added. \nMr Taylor's report also found overall rates of violence had increased at the prison and the use of force was higher than at most other reception prisons, while more than half of inmates said they found it easy to access drugs.\nHe said: \"The prison population crisis has undoubtedly compounded the pressures on the jail, but the appalling conditions at Wandsworth did not appear overnight and are the result of sustained decline permitted to happen in plain view of leaders in the jail, [HM Prison and Probation Service] and the MoJ whose own systems clearly identified the prison as struggling.\"\nMr Taylor added there was a \"degree of despondency\" among prisoners and while \"many well-meaning and hard-working leaders and staff persevered at Wandsworth, but they were often fighting against a tide of cross-cutting, intractable problems that require comprehensive, long-term solutions\".\nFollowing the publication of the report, an MoJ spokesperson said the inspector's concerns would be addressed \"immediately\" with the deployment of extra specialist staff.\nThey added that \u00a3100m will be \"redirected\" to Wandsworth \"from across the prison service that will be spent over five years to deliver urgent improvements\".\nLord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said: \u201cThis is the reality of a prison system in crisis.

    "Deep under the northern Israeli city of Haifa, there\u2019s a vast underground hospital.\nHundreds and hundreds of beds are lined up within its concrete walls.\nThere are operating theatres, a maternity ward, and medical supplies stacked up in corners.\nBut there are no patients \u2013 yet.\nRambam Medical Centre excavated this bunker after the Israel-Hezbollah war of 2006.\nIt\u2019s normally a multi-storey car park but it can be converted into a hospital in less than three days.\nIt\u2019s been on standby since shortly after the Hamas attacks of 7 October and Israel\u2019s subsequent military campaign in Gaza.\nThe facility has more than 2,000 beds. In the event of a major attack on Israel, it would take in existing patients from the overground medical centre and other nearby hospitals. And there\u2019s room too to treat injured casualties.\nAs the threat of an all-out regional war looms large following the killing of Hamas\u2019 political leader Ismael Haniyeh and Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr last week, doctors here say they\u2019re prepared for a major attack on Haifa.\n\"When, when, when is it going to happen? Nobody knows. We talk about it a lot,\" says Dr Avi Weissman, the medical director of the centre.\nPeople, he adds, are anxious. He and his staff just hope that any escalation of violence doesn\u2019t last long.\nNot far from the hospital there\u2019s a stunning viewpoint over the city and its thriving port.\nOut to sea, ships and tankers glide across the water.\nBut Haifa\u2019s proximity to Lebanon \u2013 and Hezbollah\u2019s rockets \u2013 leaves it vulnerable.\nLook out over the shipping lanes and you can see the border.\nThe people who live here are used to emergency drills every few months. School children regularly rehearse what to do in the event of an attack.\nOne young couple we met in the city centre described living with that threat.\n\"It\u2019s like a ticking timebomb,\" says the woman. \"Any minute now it could be an alarm. Will I die? Will I have time to go to my family?\"\nOthers are less concerned. In his newly-opened coffee shop, Luai poured a cappuccino and said he had grown accustomed to the situation.\n\"People are afraid. I\u2019m not afraid,\" he said. \nBut in Haifa City Hall, the mayor admits to sleepless nights. Yona Yahav is in his eighties and the weight of responsibility hoods his eyes. He also ran the city during the 2006 war.\n\"I\u2019m very sad about it,\" he said. \"There is a fork in the Middle East. The leaders are only concerned with destruction, killing, fighting instead of building.\"\nHaifa is a so-called \"mixed city\"; a place where a significant number of Israeli Arabs live alongside Israeli Jews. Mr Yahav says it\u2019s a peaceful community, which makes the current conflict all the more painful.\nPeace, he insists, is still possible.\nAnd international diplomacy continues even as Haifa\u2019s doctors prepare their fortress hospital.\nThere's still hope, perhaps, they\u2019ll never have to use it.",
    "Campaigners across Jersey are calling for updated legislation on wearing cycle helmets. \nA petition has been put forward in Jersey by Alison Marshall, whose son Brian died in a skateboarding accident 18 years ago. \nShe has campaigned for children's helmet laws in Jersey to be extended to skateboards, scooters and roller-skates. \nThe Government of Jersey has been approached for comment. \nCyclists in Jersey under the age of 14 currently have to wear a helmet by law, after it was voted in by politicians in 2014. \nMs Marshall said she had been working with Headway Jersey to improve helmet safety across the island. \nShe described her son's accident, which happened outside their home, as \"devastating\". \nShe said: \"When I spoke to the doctor, he said Brian would not have passed if he had been wearing a helmet.\"\nShe added that she wanted to work with the community and government \"to improve awareness, education and to revisit legislation that isn't in line\".\nIn Guernsey, there are no laws in place on helmet-wearing.\nCharity Headway Guernsey said it encouraged all islanders to wear cycle helmets \"especially young children as they are particularly vulnerable\".\nDeputy Lindsay de Sausmarez, president of the Committee for the Environment & Infrastructure, said the committee was \"not minded to introduce new legislation which is not absolutely necessary\" as such laws \"can act as barrier for some people, and evidence suggests that the net effect could even be negative\". \nShe added: \"While we\u2019d encourage people to wear helmets when riding a bike, the committee\u2019s priority in terms of improving safety \u2013 and with it more people\u2019s appetite to consider riding a bike \u2013 is to focus on improving infrastructure as appropriate, which is what will have the most positive impact on safety for all road users.\"\nJo Watts, a former Commonwealth Games cyclist from Guernsey, was hospitalised after a collision with a car while training for the 2015 Island Games in Jersey. \nShe broke 11 bones and was in hospital for a week, needing to have an operation. \nMs Watts said wearing her helmet was \"a matter of life and death\".\n\"My helmet was there between myself and the road to protect me,\" she said.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "Jeremy Corbyn is in talks with four other independent MPs to form a new group, potentially boosting their influence in Parliament.\nSix independent MPs were elected at the 2024 general election - the most in modern history \u2013 including the former Labour leader.\nThe potential grouping of five independents \u2013 who all campaigned on a pro-Palestinian platform - would equal the number of Reform UK MPs and outnumber the Greens.\nWhile nothing has been formalised, Shockat Adam - who unseated Labour's Jonathan Ashworth to become MP for Leicester South - told the BBC the group was \"looking at options that would give us more access to the levers of power\".\nAlex Easton, the former leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in the Northern Ireland Assembly who was elected as independent MP for North Down, is not part of the discussions, the BBC understands. \nMr Corbyn and Mr Adam have been talking to fellow independents Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain and Iqbal Mohamed to explore options on how they can impact policy more effectively.\nAll five beat Labour candidates in July's election with their pro-Palestine stance in Labour-supporting constituencies with large Muslim populations.\nIf the five independents became an official group in Parliament, they would increase their chances of taking part in debates and committees, which are usually decided proportional to party size.\nEstablished parties of five MPs have previously been eligible for as much as \u00a3129,000 in \"short money\" - public funds given to opposition parties to support research.\nHowever, Parliament's rules currently appear to prevent these funds going to new groups formed between general elections.\nBut by collaborating the independents could secure more funds for their campaign work by sharing resources and hosting joint fundraisers.\nGiven Labour's huge majority it is unclear how effective a force the independents will be in parliament.\nBut the loose coalition has already worked together to try to influence policy and together with Green MPs tabled a series of amendments to the Kings Speech.\nOne of their first actions was to reach out to the seven Labour MPs - all former allies of Mr Corbyn including his former shadow chancellor John McDonnell - who were suspended from the party for six months after voting in favour of a rebel amendment to scrap the two-child benefit.\nSo far, there has been no formal coordination between independent MPs and suspended Labour MPs, the BBC understands.\nMr Corbyn said: \"I was elected by my constituents to speak out against the genocide in Gaza, against child poverty and against the demonisation of migrants and refugees. \n\"I am proud to work alongside my fellow independent colleagues to make sure our constituents\u2019 voices are heard. \n\"This country is demanding real change - and the more MPs who are prepared to stand up for international law, defend refugees and oppose the far-right, the better.\"\nMr Corbyn retained the Islington North seat he has represented for more than 40 years in July's general election, defeating the Labour candidate by 7,000 votes.\nLabour's ruling body blocked Mr Corbyn from standing as the party's candidate in March 2023. He had previously been suspended from Labour over his response to a report into antisemitism in the party during his time as leader.\nMr Adam was part of one of the big shocks of election night when he won his seat by 979 votes from former Labour shadow minister Mr Ashworth, who had a majority of more than 20,000.\nThe optometrist, who ran for office for the first time in 2024, said that whatever happens in the future he does not want to lose his independence as he believes many MPs have been \"hamstrung\" by parties.\nHe said he ran as an independent to \"show you can do it without the political parties\" and that \"normal people can win an election\".\nMr Adam is calling on parliament to improve the standing of independent MPs, as current rules favour larger parties in setting debates and senior committee roles.\nHe predicts there will be more independent MPs in the future \"as more people are going to look at ways to be the representation and the change they want to see\".\n\"We will be a test case,\" Mr Adam said.",
    "There must be a \"zero tolerance approach\" in response to violence which erupted in Belfast over the weekend, the first and deputy first ministers have said.\nA cafe was set alight and a number of businesses were attacked after an anti-immigration protest which took place in the city on Saturday.\nEarlier, Justice Minister Naomi Long defended the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) response to the \"challenging situation\" at the weekend.\nAssembly members are also being recalled from their summer break on Thursday to discuss the weekend's disorder.\nOn Monday evening, police asked the public to avoid the Sandy Row/Donegall Road area due to further disorder.\nEarlier, the first and deputy first ministers spoke to PSNI chief Constable Jon Boutcher about Saturday\u2019s violence.\nAfter the phone call, Michelle O\u2019Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly said \"there is no justification for racism or for the violence and intimidation that occurred on our streets on Saturday\".\nThey added they offered their full support to the chief constable and asked for those with information to contact police.\n\u201cThere must be a zero tolerance approach to racism and wanton destruction,\" the statement continued.\n\u201cNobody should have to live in fear or threat of violence.\u201d\nSome of the victims questioned the effectiveness of the policing operation after crowds involved in the city centre protest were able to move into streets in south Belfast where they attacked businesses.\nMs Long said the PSNI was effective in stopping people making it to the Belfast Islamic Centre on University Road.\nBut she added the violence at other sites was \u201csporadic\u201d and \"harder for police to keep on top of\". \n\"We cannot have further scenes like this on the streets of this city,\" she added.\nThe justice minister said a Stormont recall is important as \"political leadership has to be given, and we are the people who should be giving that leadership\".\nFour men, aged 53, 46, 38 and 34, have appeared in court charged with different offences linked to the disorder.\nSome Belfast business owners \u201chave seen their entire livelihood wiped out in one night of sickening violence\u201d, Ms Long said.\nThe Alliance leader accepted that some people had attended the protest because they had genuine concerns about immigration, but she accused others of being \u201cintent on creating mayhem\u201d.\nSaturday\u2019s scenes had caused \u201cirreparable\u201d damage to the city\u2019s reputation and racially-motivated violence would make it more difficult to recruit overseas workers to staff the health service, she continued.\nAt a special Belfast City Council meeting on Monday, councillors passed a motion about providing financial support to businesses damaged during the disorder.\nThe motion calls for the council to establish a programme of financial assistance for those \"impacted by racist criminal attacks\".\nAfter the protest outside the city hall on Saturday, some anti-immigration protesters attempted to march to the Belfast Islamic Centre in south Belfast\nKashif Akram, a member of the executive committee for Belfast Islamic Centre, said the building itself was \u201cwell protected\u201d but the community and shops in the area were \u201cnot safe at all\u201d.\nMr Akram said the Islamic Centre has received an \u201cunbelievable\u201d amount of messages over the weekend.\n\u201cThe fear in a lot of them: \u2018Should we be opening up today, should we be going to work, should we be leaving home?\u2019 \n\"Especially in this day and age, for someone having a fear for their life, their livelihood, their income, it\u2019s not acceptable.\"\n\u201cDespite all the assurances from PSNI leadership in the run up to Saturday\u2019s mobilisations of what looked like far-right thugs, they were simply allowed to run free on the streets of Belfast,\" Mr Akram added.\n\"The inevitable outcome you\u2019ve seen on the route \u2013 people were verbally abused, there was racist comments being made, people were physically attacked, you\u2019ve seen the state of some of the shops.\u201d\nHe said plans for an upcoming rally \u201cneeds to be stopped\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s organised crime, it\u2019s racism and it needs to be nipped in the bud. It\u2019s the first time in a long time I\u2019ve felt fearful for my children leaving the house on a Saturday afternoon to enjoy themselves and it needs to be addressed.\u201d\nMatthew O\u2019Toole, from the SDLP, attended a counter-demonstration against the anti-immigration protest.\nHe said the violent scenes witnessed in Belfast \"can't be allowed to happen again\".\nHe described the attacks on south Belfast businesses as \u201ca violation of a community that is proudly diverse\u201d.\n\u201cTo think that a group of people with nothing but hate on their minds were allowed to rampage through that area is profoundly upsetting and infuriating and we need to ensure nothing like that ever happens again,\u201d he said.\nDemocratic Unionist Party policing board member Trevor Clarke said the protests resulted from a \"build-up\" of frustrations and many had expressed concern to his constituency office.\nHowever, he said: \"There\u2019s a difference between peaceful protest and the viol",

    "Train drivers will vote on a new pay deal aimed at ending long-running strike action.\nIt follows talks between representatives of Aslef and the Department for Transport that aimed to resolve the pay dispute between drivers and train companies in England.\nThe new offer is for a 5% backdated pay rise for 2022/23, a 4.75% rise for 23/24, and 4.5% increase for 24/25.\nAslef said the new deal was a \"no-strings\" offer, meaning it is not conditional on changes to working practices.\nThe proposed deal could end the long running train drivers\u2019 dispute if members accept it in a vote.\nMore than a dozen England based train companies have been affected by strike action.\nAslef leader Mick Whelan insisted the new government had not rolled over and given in to all his demands.\n\u201cIf it was everything I wanted it wouldn't have been this deal, it would have been a higher deal, more representative of the higher cost of inflation,\" he told the BBC.\nA breakthrough would herald the end of industrial action which has spanned more than two years and saw drivers stage 18 strikes and take part in several overtime bans, leading to cancelled services.\nUnder the new Labour government, senior officials began direct pay talks with Aslef bosses last month.\nIndustrial action has continued since Aslef last rejected a pay offer back in April 2023. More recently the union\u2019s tactic has been to spread walkouts over several days, with different operators affected on each day.\nThe package included successive pay rises of 4%, which the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said would bring the average annual pay for a driver to \u00a365,000.\nAccording to the Rail Delivery Group, the average train driver salary across the network in 2023 was \u00a360,055.\nHowever, the conditions attached were a significant point of contention. \nTrain companies and the Conservative government argued that changes to ways of working, for example to training and rosters, were necessary to make the railway function more reliably and save money.\nThey said hard-pressed taxpayers were having to contribute millions each week to keep services running.\nHowever, Aslef argued drivers were being asked to sacrifice too much in exchange for too low a wage rise.\nThe dispute was at a standstill for a year before signs of progress in May. But the general election was called before there could be a resolution.\nUnder the previous government, negotiations were conducted by the Rail Delivery Group but ministers have had to approve any pay offer as the government in effect took control of the railway during the Covid pandemic.\nWhen the Labour government was elected in July, transport secretary Louise Haigh said she was \"committed to resetting industrial relations\".\nMs Haigh called the new deal a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d, accusing the previous government of dragging the strikes out.\n\u201cWhen I took this job, I said I wanted to move fast and fix things \u2013 starting by bringing an end to rail strikes.\n\u201cThe Conservatives were happy to see the taxpayer pay the price as strikes dragged on and on, and passengers suffered. This Labour Government is doing the right thing and putting passengers first,\" Ms Haigh said.\nHelen Whately, shadow transport secretary, said: \"A \u2018no strings\u2019 deal means this will be paid for by passengers and tax payers. \n\"We have to make our railways more efficient - but instead Labour has just caved to the unions. \n\"Ditching working practice reforms leaves a hole in the finances that can only be filled by higher fares or higher taxes.\"\nThe Rail Delivery Group has since been removed from negotiations, with Department for Transport officials leading talks instead in July.\nThe Aslef union says it has more than 21,000 members and represents 96% of all the train drivers in England, Scotland, and Wales, where it is organised.\nIn a separate dispute, train drivers working for publicly run Scotrail are currently being balloted for strike action over pay.",

    "The detective trying to piece together what happened to a baby hidden beneath floorboards more than a century ago says he hopes to find living relatives.\nThe skeleton of the full-term child was discovered with twine around its neck at a house in Fore Bondgate, Bishop Auckland, last month.\nDurham Police said the sex of the baby has yet to be determined, but its death was likely suspicious.\nDet Ch Insp Mel Sutherland said he felt it was his duty to be the voice of the baby who \"never got the chance to tell its story.\"\nHe said it would take at least eight weeks for radio carbon dating analysis to determine exactly how long ago the baby was concealed.\nThe remains were wrapped in a newspaper and investigators were able to identify a fragment dated from 1910.\nA forensic anthropologist measured the child's bones and development of its teeth and was able to determine it was full-term at 40 weeks. \nMr Sutherland said he had hoped to be able to create a digital image of what the child may have looked like, but that was not possible because of the lack of developed facial features.\nHe said the key to solving the mystery was to rely on science. \n\"Because of the length of time since the baby was concealed, we cannot rely on our usual lines of inquiry such as CCTV footage, house-to-house, witnesses and digital footprints,\" he added.\nThe next stage of the investigation is for police to trawl through records spanning the years 1900 to 1920.\nMr Sutherland said: \"We are hopefully going to identify some surviving family members; long lost relatives who we can then sensitively approach.\"\nBut he warned it was also possible that no living family members would be traced.\nThe property where the baby was found dates to the Victorian period and at one stage housed a church-run mother and baby unit.\nHowever, it is believed the baby was concealed before the unit was set up.\n\"It's really important to me that that story is told and that we then give the baby a full and dignified funeral,\" Mr Sutherland added.\n\"I think we will get a good picture of who was in the house at the time, what the house was used for and identify some family members.\"\nHowever, he said it was possible they would never know what happened \"in the moment\" the child died.\n Follow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Jordan Stewart was 13 when his mum allowed him to make his first solo coach trip. \nHe made the 22-mile trip to Perth from his home near Kelty in Fife - then returned on the same bus. \nIt was the start of a daily obsession which, from the age of 16, saw him travelling as far as London by coach.  \nNow 19, Jordan clocks up tens of thousands of miles a year on coach travel and has just returned from a three-day trip from Glasgow to Sofia in Bulgaria. \nBut he rarely stops to take in the sights of his destination. Instead he waits while the bus is cleaned and refuelled, before jumping back on and heading home. \nHis coach trips normally take him across Scotland and he makes the journey to London twice a month before getting straight back on the return bus. \n\"Every day is different, every trip you see something different. It might be the same place but you see something different,\" he told BBC Scotland News. \nJordan, who is autistic, has a pass which allows him to book tickets for free in Scotland but he pays full price when he travels further afield. \nHe always books two seats so he has more room to be comfortable and makes sure he is behind the driver so he can watch the dashboard.\nHis dream is to become a coach driver, which he can apply for when he becomes 21. \n\"I've always liked transport ever since I've been a wee boy with buses and trains being my main thing,\" he said. \n\"Maps and timetables I studied them like anything. I'm very times conscious and I hate when a bus is early and I hate when a bus is late. I'm always watching the time.\"\nHe has thousands of maps and timetables at home and his bedroom is covered in coach information and leaflets.\nIn the last few years he has become a fan of the company Flixbus and has struck up friendships with some of the drivers. \nSandra Starkey, who works with her husband William on long-haul coach journeys, said Jordan was on their very first trip with Flixbus. \n\"We have now become friendly with him and ever since then he comes on the journeys with us,\" she said. \n\"Jordan is a superfan. He knows everything about Flixbus. He can tell you every service, where they are, what they are doing.\"\nShe added: \"He's so kind when we have travelled up from London. He will be waiting for us in Edinburgh bus station and he brings me a big cup of tea because he knows I've not had one on the journey and he knows I don't take milk or sugar.\n\"On my husband's birthday he bought him a pair of Flixbus socks to match his uniform.\"\nSandra said Jordan liked to take photographs of the coaches, and to sit behind the driver and watch the \"digital things on the dash\". \n\"He likes to know if you get an over-speed. That can happen if you're going down a hill,\" she said. \n\"It flashes up and you have to bring yourself back down before you get recorded on it. It sometimes happens.\"\nShe said she would like to see him get a job with Flixbus as he is so dedicated to it. \n\"He's extraordinary, there is nobody else like that,\" she said. \nOn longer journeys, when two people take turns to drive, Jordan will talk to the resting driver. \n\"We have a good laugh, it can be a good trip,\" he said. \n\"I just enjoy travelling, I go for the journey.\"\nHe added: \"I find it so relaxing.\n\"I have my extra seat beside me for comfort and I make sure I have lots of juice because I was once stuck all night on the A9 from Inverness when there was a fatal crash and the bus couldn't fit down the diversion.\"\nAnd what's his tip for the perfect journey?\n\"Make sure you take lots of juice and battery packs so you can listen to your phone.\"",
    "As hundreds across the UK face their day of reckoning following the recent rioting and disorder, one boy seen hurling missiles at police officers has faced a judge while sitting shame-faced between his parents and holding his mother's hand.\nThe 15-year-old was the youngest of four defendants making their first appearances in court in Hull on Thursday after trouble flared in the city centre. \nPolice officers were attacked, shops were looted and fires were started as a demonstration descended into violence in the Ferensway, Jameson Street and Spring Bank areas on Saturday.\nSo far there have been about 500 arrests and nearly 150 people have been charged following the UK-wide disturbances triggered by the fatal stabbings of three young girls in Southport last week.\nDressed smartly in a blue suit and flanked by his mother and father in Courtroom 1 at Hull Magistrates Court on Thursday, the 15-year-old was one of two men and two youths who admitted taking part in the disorder.\nActing as a youth court, it heard that the boy \u2013 who cannot be identified because of his age \u2013 had travelled from his home in North Lincolnshire to meet friends in the city.\nDistrict Judge Mark Daley was told the youngster was caught on CCTV throwing missiles at officers on multiple occasions \u2013 firstly on Ferensway in front of a hotel and then later on Spring Bank. \nIn between the missile-throwing, he moved to Jameson Street, where he encouraged someone else to smash the window of a Greggs store. He then went in and stole food before heading down to Lush to steal bath products, prosecutor Emily Robinson said.\nThe boy's solicitor, Joe Painter, argued he was \"ignorant\" to the protests taking place earlier in the day, and he was encouraged to throw items at police after he \"decided to involve himself\".\n\"There was no mask,\" said Mr Painter. \n\"It's not something he planned to do. He got carried away with it all.\n\"He's now ruined his previous good character.\"\nWhen the judge asked him to stand up, he let go of his mother's hand \u2013 she was on the brink of tears \u2013 and addressed him.\n\"It was wrong of me to do that,\" said the boy, looking solemn.\nThe youngster is due to be sentenced on 2 September after he admitted violent disorder and two counts of burglary.\nEarlier, Brandon Kirkwood, of Downing Grove, Hull, stood in the dock wearing grey sweatpants and top.\nHe was also looking sombre as Ms Robinson outlined to the court how the 20-year-old was \"rioting in the city centre for several hours\".\n\"He was captured on CCTV pushing a large missile at officers,\" she said.\nThe prosecutor described how he shouted abuse at the police and threw things at them.\nMr Kirkwood's solicitor told the court he \"had no intention of being involved\" in the unrest and there was \"deep regret\" by him.\n\"He went into the city centre with friends to get food and found himself in the middle of the violent disorder.\"\nThe 20-year-old, who pleaded guilty to violent disorder, was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Hull Crown Court on Friday.\nA 16-year-old boy from Hull then entered the dock to admit the same charge.\nMs Robinson said he was part of a large group of people who had pushed a commercial-size wheelie bin towards police officers outside the Royal Hotel on Ferensway.\nHis offending, which included throwing missiles and shouting abuse at officers, lasted several hours, the court heard.\nAdjourning his case until 27 August, Judge Daley told him: \"This is a very serious matter that you got yourself involved in... causing damage to the local community.\"\nThe last defendant to appear in court during the session was Christopher Douglas, 35, of Avenues Court, Hull.\n\"He was at the forefront of violent disorder, shouting abuse at officers and throwing missiles at them,\" said Ms Robinson.\n\"At one stage he was seen in possession of a police shield holding it above his head.\"\nThe military veteran, who had been diagnosed with PTSD, was \"very remorseful and very apologetic\", according to his solicitor Emma Bradley.\n\"He has some mental health difficulties,\" she added.\nDouglas was remanded in custody after pleading guilty to violent disorder and is also due to be sentenced at Hull Crown Court on Friday.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "A new evacuation alert for the Greek seaside town of Nea Makri has been ordered on Tuesday, as fierce wildfires continue to affect the suburbs of Athens. \nOne person has died, with a body, believed to be of a woman, found inside a shop in the town of Vrilissia, northern Athens, a source from the fire service told the BBC.\nThousands of people have been evacuated after firefighters warned that homes, businesses and schools were under threat.\nThe huge smoke cloud that lingered over Athens cleared as Tuesday dawned, although the air is still hazy.\nHelicopters were circling the skies after being grounded overnight for safety reasons.\nResidents in areas of Athens that haven\u2019t even been directly affected by the fire  said they have found ash settling on their balconies.\nFirefighters, who have told the BBC they are \u201cexhausted\u201d, appear to be focussing on hotspots rather than one major fire front. \nFire service spokesman Col Vassilios Vathrakogiannis said while there was no longer a single active fire front in the north-eastern Attica region, which includes parts of Athens, there were still \"many active localised blazes\", mostly around the towns of Marathon and Penteli.\nConditions for new fires remain dangerous not only on Tuesday, but also for further into the week, he said in a statement released on Monday evening.\nMore than 700 firefighters, 199 fire engines and 35 waterbombing aircraft have been involved in efforts to extinguish the fires, which first broke out on Sunday afternoon around 35km (22 miles) north of the Greek capital. \nCol Vathrakogiannis said two firefighters had received treatment for burns while fighting the blazes. \nOfficials said fires broke out in 40 different locations on Monday and that some areas saw flames as high as 25m (82ft).\nIn unprecedented scenes, people in Athens wore facemasks to protect themselves from the smoke, which blew into the city. \nGreece's National Observatory said on Monday evening satellite images showed that, by noon local time (10:00 BST), the fire had already affected around 100,000 acres (405 sq km; 156 sq miles) of land.\nIn Penteli, a wooded, hilly region, three hospitals had to be evacuated, and one of the sites of the National Observatory was at one stage feared to be under threat. \nThe blaze also engulfed a timber factory, and elsewhere in the area a number of explosions were heard, most likely from fuel tanks and residential gas cylinders.\nDespite the danger, some Penteli residents chose to stay near their homes and tried to put out pockets of fire using hoses or tree branches. \n\"It hurts. We have grown up in the forest. We feel great sadness and anger,\" 24-year-old resident Marina Kalogerakou told Reuters news agency as she poured water from a bucket onto a burning tree stump. \n\nPantelis Kyriazis, another resident, crashed his car as he tried to leave. \n\"I couldn't see. I hit a pine tree and this is what happened,\" he said, gesturing towards the car. \nFurther north, near the epicentre of the fire, 81-year-old Vassilis Stroubelis stood in the doorway of his damaged home. \n\"Thirty years I was building all this. Thirty years and bam,\" he said.\nEuropean nations have announced assistance for Greece after its government activated the EU's mutual civil protection mechanism.\nItaly is providing two planes while France and Serbia are providing one helicopter each, Col Vathrakogiannis said.\nSpain, the Czech Republic and Romania are sending further vehicles, personnel, and aid.\nNeighbouring Turkey is also preparing to send two planes and a helicopter, Foreign Minister \u00d6nc\u00fc Ke\u00e7eli said. \nWriting on X, formerly Twitter, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would \"stand with Greece as it battles devastating fires\".\nGreece has just experienced its hottest June and July on record.\nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.",

    "Ousted Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina made a request to come to India \"at very short notice\", the Indian foreign minister told parliament.\nMs Hasina fled from Bangladesh to India on Monday evening after a political crisis toppled her government. \nForeign Minister S Jaishankar did not mention how long she would stay in the country or what her next steps would be. \nIn his first official comments since the crisis peaked in Bangladesh, he said India had been in regular contact with authorities in Dhaka over the past 24 hours.\nMs Hasina resigned on Monday after weeks of deadly anti-government protests. The country's army chief has promised that an interim government will be formed and new elections will be announced.\nIndia shares a 4,096km (2,545 miles)-border with Bangladesh and has close economic and cultural ties with the country. There are worries that prolonged tensions in Bangladesh could spill over into India, which is seen as having supported Ms Hasina through her 15-year-long tenure despite her clamping down on dissent and jailing opposition leaders.\nOn Monday, India deployed additional troops along its border with Bangladesh.\nMr Jaishankar said the situation there was \"still evolving\" and that the government was in \"close and continuous touch with the Indian community\" through its diplomatic missions. The minister said there are 19,000 Indians, including 9,000 students, in Bangladesh and added that most of the students had returned to India in July.\nHe said India was monitoring the situation regarding the status of minorities in the country.\n\"There are reports of initiatives by various groups and organisations to ensure their protection and well-being. We welcome that but will naturally remain deeply concerned till law and order is restored,\" he said.\nEarlier in the day, Mr Jaishankar briefed opposition parties on India's response to the developments in Bangladesh. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also held a meeting on Monday to review the situation. \nFive Indian states share a border with Bangladesh, which was formed in 1971 after a war with Pakistan. According to government data from last November, around 915.35km of the border is not fenced.\nFrom a security perspective, Ms Hasina's tenure was relatively peaceful for India as she had cracked down on anti-India militants in her country. She had also granted transit rights to secure trade routes for the states bordering Bangladesh. \nOn Monday, top officials of India's Border Security Force (BSF) visited the Bangladesh border in the eastern state of West Bengal to review \"operational preparedness and strategic deployment of BSF in these important border areas\", a spokesperson said.\nThe BSF said \u201cit has received strict instruction from the government to not allow anyone into the country without valid documents\u201d.\nTrain services between India and Bangladesh have been suspended \"indefinitely\" - they had been halted since mid-July after violent protests broke out in Bangladesh.\nOn Monday, following Ms Hasina's resignation, the north-eastern state of Meghalaya imposed a night curfew along its border with Bangladesh. \nIn West Bengal, the state which shares the longest border with  Bangladesh as well as close linguistic and cultural ties, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has appealed for peace. \nMovement of goods through the Petrapole land port on the border has also been stopped. Reports say hundreds of Indian trucks are stuck on the Bangladesh side.\nA senior diplomat told the BBC on Monday that India \"doesn\u2019t have too many options at this point in time\". \n\"We have to tighten control on our borders.

    "A County Tyrone man allegedly held a knife to a three-year-old child\u2019s throat after calling at his home for a drink of water, the High Court was told on Thursday.\nSimon McNulty, 25, of Lismore Grove, Sion Mills, is also accused of threatening to \"slice\" the boy\u2019s mother and leave him without a parent.\nHe denies brandishing a blade and claims he was invited to bring wine to the property in Strabane.\nHe was granted bail on charges of having an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, making threats to kill and assault.\nDuring the bail application, the court was told that a woman reported to police on July 15 that he was inside her house in the Orchard Street area with a knife.\nOfficers forced entry as she shouted for help and detained Mr McNulty at the top of the stairs.\nThe woman and her young son were found in a bedroom, where a six-inch black handled knife was discovered lying on the floor.\n\u201cShe was in an extreme state of shock and informed police the applicant had called at her home for a glass of water,\u201d prosecution counsel said.\n\u201cShe let him in and soon after he followed her upstairs.\n\u201cWhilst in the bedroom, he put a knife to the throat of the three year-old.\u201d\nIt was claimed that the defendant punched her a number of times after she pushed him away from the child.\n\u201cShe then said he put the knife to her throat, saying he was going to slice it and leave her son with no mother,\u201d the barrister added.\nAs Mr McNulty was being put into a police car he threatened to headbutt officers, according to the prosecution, kicking one of them on the wrist and spitting on the hand of another.\nIn police interviews, the defendant claimed the woman had invited him to her home the previous day and asked him to bring alcohol.\nHe told police that he arrived with drink and cocaine, spent the night at the address and left the following day to get more alcohol and drugs.\nWhen Mr McNulty returned the woman allegedly became aggressive, but he insisted that at no point did he hold a knife to anyone\u2019s throat.\nHe claimed that she sustained her injuries during a previous fall in the garden.\nDefence barrister Seamus Lannon said the complainant sent his client a WhatsApp message asking him to bring wine to her house.\n\u201cThat would be independent objective evidence that he didn\u2019t turn up looking for a drink of water,\u201d he submitted.\n\u201cIf that resolves in his favour it fatally undermines a lot of other assertions made by the complainant.\u201d\nMr Lannon also stressed that no razor was found at the property.\nMr McNulty was granted bail based on condition he is not in an ongoing relationship with the woman.\nMr Justice Colton ordered that \u00a31,500 in cash sureties be lodged before the accused is released from custody and he cannot have any contact with the complainant or be within one mile of her home.

    "Protests in of Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday left the young cast of a dance show \"terrified\", one of their leaders has said.\nDance group SCDC cancelled the final performance at the Regent Theatre after the venue was put in lockdown as protesters gathered nearby.\nKatie Tonkin Beardmore, the group's manager, said some of the children were in tears and the cancelled show had hit SCDC financially. \nThe protests were sparked by the death of three girls at a dance event in Southport, and Ms Tonkin Beardmore said that incident was at the forefront of organisers' minds.\n\"It hits hard thinking it was to do with dance as well, and then we're all here,\" she said.\nThe protests were among several across the UK on Saturday, some of which turned violent.\nPolice made 10 arrests in Stoke-on-Trent as hundreds of people gathered in Hanley, some wearing masks to conceal their identity.\nWhile it was largely peaceful in the morning, it turned increasingly violent during the afternoon, with police coming under fire from missiles.\nThe dance show featured 297 children and although the youngest had left at half time, those caught up in the lockdown were as young as six.\nSCDC had been due to perform three shows, and leaders became aware of the worsening situation in Hanley as the children were on stage during the second of those.\nMs Tonkin Beardmore said: \"It was very tense for us, but we were trying to keep it cool for these guys because they were still dancing on that stage.\"\nShe said when the protests were heard outside \"the doors were locked, security had everyone in one room together and the safety curtain came down\".\nAs well as letting anxious parents know what was happening, organisers had to get people in and out to bring the children food and drinks.\nShe said it was \"terrifying because we didn't know what was going on and we didn't know what to do\".\nOne of the children, Eliza from Fenton, added: \"It was really, really scary because I didn't know what to do and I felt really, really worried.\"\nParents faced an anxious wait until it was safe to collect their children.\nOne parent said protesters were marching shouting \"save the kids\", but that it was \"kids like that who have been impacted by their actions\".\nAnother parent Craig Woodward said: \"I was just devastated because you're not here, you don't know what's happening, it's just scary.\"\nHe said he was able to communicate with his daughter, who had a phone, and was confident the theatre was a safe place to be.\n\"It's not fair and you just feel the disappointment of the children,\" he added.\nThere are hopes that another date can be found for a rescheduled final show and an online fundraising page has been set up to help the dance group with its costs.\nMs Tonkin Beardmore said: \"I don't want to talk about how much money it's cost, because it's cost a lot.\"\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Parents in Bristol are being asked to recycle their children's used nappies as part of a new trial this month.\nPura NappiCycle are conducting the 12-month study, the largest of its kind to, to attempt to reduce the environmental impact of discarding used nappies.\nThey estimate that 3bn disposable nappies are used annually in the UK, with used diapers lasting more than 500 years in landfill.\nCellulose fibres extracted from the recycled nappies can then be used for a variety of purposes, including the paving of roads and making notice boards.\nIt follows a smaller trial the company undertook in Bristol in June 2022. The project saved 6.3 tonnes of waste during the six-month period- the equivalent of 31,500 nappies.\nThe idea for the project came to NappiCycle founder Rob Poyer, who had previously worked as a landfill manager. Then a director of a clinical waste collection company in Wales, he set about trying to find a cost-efficient solution for nappy and other hygiene product waste.\nFollowing numerous successful trials in the country, he was approached by Guy Fennell, green hygiene brand co-founder of Pura baby care.\n\"Guy approached me seeking a solution to nappy waste and the Pura NappiCycle partnership began in 2020. From day one, Guy had a vision of mirroring what is happening outside of Wales in the rest of the UK.\n\"NappiCycle is now a world-leader in nappy recycling technology and recycles 40 million nappies a year.\"\nInterested parents can sign up for the trial through the NappiCycle website.\nThe used products will be picked up from the homes of selected families and transported to a NappiCyle facility. The dirty nappies will then be cleaned and processed, with plastic and cellulose fibres extracted.\nMr Poyer said: \"The cellulose fibre recovered from used nappies can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including the production of fibre boards and acoustic panelling, with the plastics sent to secondary re-processors for recycling.\"\nIn 2022, the recycled fibres were also used to resurface a section of the A487 road in Wales.\nIf this new trial in Bristol is successful, it will inform their conversations with the UK Government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as well as with local authorities.\n\"In the rest of the UK, local authorities aren\u2019t incentivised to improve recycling targets as they are in Wales. To mimic what is happening in Wales, legislative change and support from local and central government is needed.\n\"We hope the trial results will help inform and convince those in power about the feasibility and benefits of nappy recycling\", Mr Poyer added.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A man has pleaded guilty to fraud after he took out finance on a \u00a345,000 BMW which police say he had no intention of paying for.\nChristopher Hudson, 44, bought the 320i M Sport from a London dealership in October 2021, but stopped making payments after two months.\nHe used the name 'Jeremy Trodwell' and registered the address to Hampton, Peterborough. After stopping payments his agreement was terminated and a request to repossess the vehicle issued.\nHudson, of Sunray Avenue, Bromley, Greater London, was sentenced to 15 months, suspended for two years, at Huntingdon Law Courts on Friday. \nIn March 2022, Hudson told his car company he was in hospital with Covid and had been for the past two months, but he would make payments and arrears when he got out.\nNo payments were made and attempts to recover the car at its registered address failed. \nPolice in Sussex received an ANPR hit for the vehicle, now classified as stolen, at Gatwick Airport in August 2022. \nHudson told police the car was registered to his friend Jeremy Trodwell and he was unaware whether the payments were up to date. \nHe also claimed he did not have any ID on him or proof of insurance.\nOfficers explained that without them the car would be seized and Hudson admitted that he used to go by the name Jeremy Trodwell.\nPC Christopher Ogden said it was \"quite clear\" Hudson had no intention of paying for the vehicle when he took out the finance. \n\"He used a different name, a false address and claimed he was seriously ill with Covid, all to avoid making payments,\" he said.\n\u201cHis fraudulent behaviour cost the finance company thousands of pounds and months of hassle.\" \nMr Ogden added: \"It\u2019s an insult to other law-abiding citizens who live within their means and pay their dues.

    "Russia has imposed a \"counter-terrorism operation\" regime in three regions to try to halt a surprise cross-border incursion by Ukrainian troops.\nThe authorities in the Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk regions on the border with Ukraine now can restrict the movement of people and vehicles and use phone tapping among other measures.\nThis comes as the Ukrainian offensive into the Kursk region is now in its fifth day. Kyiv has not openly admitted the incursion.\nReports say Ukrainian troops are threatening to seize one regional town as they fight more than 10km (six miles) inside Russia - the deepest advance since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nThe new security measures in the three Russian border regions were announced by the National Counter-Terrorism Committee (Nak) on Friday.\nIt said this was done \"to ensure the safety of citizens and suppress the threat of terrorist acts by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance units\". \nThe authorities now have powers to enter private homes, restrict the movement of traffic and pedestrians, order the temporary relocation of people and monitor information sent electronically. \nThis comes as Moscow is struggling to contain the Ukrainian offensive.\nMore than 76,000 people have already been evacuated from the Kursk region's border areas, according to Russia's state Tass news agency.\nRussia said that up to 1,000 Ukrainian troops, supported by tanks and armoured vehicles, entered the Kursk region on Tuesday morning.\nThe Ukrainians have since reportedly seized a number of villages, and are also threatening the regional town of Sudzha.\nOn Friday, a video emerged purportedly showing armed Ukrainian soldiers who claimed to have control over the town, as well as a key Russian gas facility there owned by the Gazprom company.\nBBC Verify has now confirmed that the footage was indeed from the Gazprom facility on the north-western outskirts of Sudzha, about 7km from the border with Ukraine. The video alone does not verify the claim that Ukrainian troops have taken the whole town.\nRussian military bloggers earlier claimed that the town was in Moscow's hands.\nEarlier, BBC Verify checked and confirmed the location of another video posted online on Friday morning. It shows a 15-vehicle Russian convoy damaged, burned and abandoned on a road through the town of Oktyabrskoe, roughly 38km from the border on the Russian side.\nThe footage also shows Russian soldiers, some injured, possibly dead among the vehicles.\nMoscow has since sent reinforcements - including tanks and rocket-launching systems - to the Kursk region.\nIn its latest report on Saturday morning, the Russian defence ministry said its troops were \"continuing to repel the attempted invasion\" of Ukrainian forces.\nIt claimed that Ukraine's attempts to \"break through deep into Russian territory\" had been foiled.\nThe Russian claims have not been independently verified.\nOn Friday, the UN nuclear agency urged both Russia and Ukraine to \"exercise maximum restraint\" as the fighting was edging closer to the Kursk nuclear power plant - one of the biggest such facilities in Russia.\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi said measures must be taken \u201cto avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences\u201d.\nThe power plant is located about 60km north-east of Sudzha.",

    "A prisoner who has served almost five times his original sentence for a laptop robbery still has no prospect of being released.\nAbdullahi Suleman, 41, from Cardiff, is still in prison after being handed an Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentence in 2005.\nThese were handed out between 2005 and 2012 to try and keep the most dangerous criminals behind bars, but scrapped after criticism, such as the fact less serious offenders were getting caught up in the provision.\nSuleman is one of the 2,734 prisoners who remain incarcerated after receiving an IPP sentence - 1,132 of whom have never been released, according to the latest data.\nBBC Wales spoke to the families of two men and one released prisoner who say their lives have been ruined by the sentences which still hang over them, despite the law since being scrapped.\nSuleman was given a minimum of three years and 276 days in prison in 2005, when he was 22. \n\"He calls them the stolen years,\" is how his wife Bernadette Emerson describes the time that has followed.  \nAs well as missing his three children growing up, Suleman is also not getting treatment for bipolar disorder, which he was diagnosed with in 2004, and has played a major role in him remaining in jail. \nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said \"it is right\" the sentences were abolished, adding: \"The Lord Chancellor is committed to working with organisations and campaign groups to ensure the appropriate course of action is taken to support those still serving IPP sentences.\"\nBut Suleman, who fled war in Somalia as a child to build a new life, remains in prison. \nThe trained plasterer was first released in 2011, but suffered a mental health breakdown and was treated in hospital. \nAfter being discharged, he was told that missing any hospital appointments or failing to take his medication would result in being recalled to prison.\nTwo-and-a-half years later he was recalled for four months, and since then he has been recalled another three times for not complying with his mental health treatment conditions.\nIn 2017, Suleman was recalled to prison for seven years for missing a hospital appointment and at his last three parole hearings he was denied release.\n\"He is not going to get treatment. He is going to get punishment,\" Ms Emerson said, adding his licence conditions have created a \"cycle\".\n\"I feel suffocated by the thought of knowing there's no end to it,\" she added.\nIPP prisoners have to complete rehabilitation courses to sit their parole hearing under the so-called IPP Action Plan.\nMs Emerson said the action plan \"exploits\" her husband's mental health.\nHe continues to be denied release because of failure to complete a two-year treatment programme for people with personality disorder due to long waiting lists or \"failure to engage\", she said. \nShaun Lloyd was also handed an IPP sentence, aged 18.\nHe was jailed for two years and nine months for stealing a mobile phone in the street in Cardiff and served nine years in prison before being released on licence.\nSince 2014, Lloyd has been recalled to prison every 18 months and been detained for close to a year each time. \nHe is currently incarcerated.\n\"I don't condone what he did. What he did was wrong and to go to prison was right,\" his mother Shirley Debono said.\nBut his IPP sentence has also ended up being \"a life sentence through the back door\", she said.\nThe continued detainment led to Lloyd becoming depressed and suicidal, Ms Debono said, and he became addicted to prescription opioids.\nHe has struggled with addiction and was recalled for lapses in drug use.\nMichael Roberts received an IPP sentence in 2006, aged 33, for armed robbery and was told he had to serve a minimum of three-and-a-half years in prison. \nRoberts, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said he already had 24 convictions for 134 offences prior to that, mainly for motoring offences.\nHe was released five years later.\nHe has been recalled to prison five times for spells lasting between seven and 14 months since.\nThe first recall happened two months after his release as a result of further allegations, for which he says he was found not guilty. \nNow working as a roofer, he has been out of prison since May and was previously in the community for seven years without being recalled.\nHis two youngest children were put up for adoption aged 18 months and seven years as a result of a recall, and he said he has had no contact with them since.\nAnother child is in foster care, while he is in contact with his older children and grandchildren. \nRoberts recognises he committed a serious crime which warranted a big sentence, and already had a criminal background.\n\"What I did to those people was bad. We had no business, no right to be doing that to those people,\" he said. \n\"I can never justify what I did. It was a stupid decision... but I've paid my price.\"\nHe also said some IPP sentences were justified for individuals who pose a significant risk.\n\"There are some seriously dangerous people who warrant IPP ",

    "Leicester's popular Diwali lights switch-on event could be \"sacrificed\" over the cost of staging it, the city's mayor has said.\nThe city traditionally celebrates the Festival of Light with two events - a switch-on of illuminations along the Golden Mile on Belgrave Road and a later fireworks display and funfair on Diwali Day itself.\nHowever the authority has been considering consolidating the two because of the \u00a3250,000 cost of staging both of them.\nCity mayor Sir Peter Soulsby was asked to clarify what would happen with 2024 events at a recent council scrutiny meeting. \nHe said the council had been involved in discussions with stakeholders and he confirmed the illuminations would be in place as normal.\nHowever he said talks were continuing over whether there would be two separate events.\n\"I understand that the stakeholders are particularly keen to see an event take place on Diwali Day itself [on 1 November] and if something has to be sacrificed it would be the switch-on event,\" he said.\nHe said efforts would continue to try to attract sponsorship funding to enable one or both events to take place in future years.\nConservative city councillor Abdul Osman said: \"We see where this is heading. The Diwali Lights switch-on is a world-famous event attended by tens of thousands of people from every community.\n\"It's a major boost to the city's economy.  Both events should remain.\n\"We have already lost the Caribbean Carnival this year.  We can't lose another major festival.\"\nKaran Modha, 37, who owns Anokhi House of Sarees in Belgrave Road, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame because the lights ceremony and Diwali day have both happened for more than 40 years now. \n\"The shop has been here since 1967 \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the birth of it [the event].\u201d\n\u201cEconomically, it makes sense but from the businesses\u2019 point of view, it is heartbreaking for those that open on the night as they\u2019ll lose that business from a prospective 40,000 people on the night [of the switch-on].\u201d\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A family said they feel \"incredibly lucky\" after a second donor was found for a four-year-old boy needing a stem cell transplant.\nGunner was born with a rare genetic disorder which prevents his body from breaking down sugar. He had his first stem cell transplant following a worldwide search for a donor in 2021 but eventually the treatment stopped working. \nThe family, from Shropshire, were worried another donor might not be found but cells from an unbilical cord blood donation from 15 years ago were used.\nGunner is now doing well and enjoying his summer. The family are supporting an ongoing NHS appeal for more people to register as stem cell donors, including umbilical cord blood donation. \nAt 17 months old Gunner was diagnosed with metabolic disorder Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) which can cause a range of health problems and reduce life expectancy. \nThe search for a stem cell donor in 2021 found a match in Germany, just before Gunner's second birthday. \nBut Holly, an administration assistant in audiology, said it \"stopped working and producing the enzyme he needs for us to keep him for as long as possible\".\n\"That was so hard to find a donor at that time during lockdown and we never imagined we'd be in this situation again,\" she said.\nShe said she had feared one could not be found but NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said cells which had been \"generously donated\" just before Christmas 2008 were provided from its cord blood bank in Bristol. \nGunner had to isolate and stay inside following the treatment in January but recently was able to play outside for the first time in six months and has been enjoying going to the park with his older sister and feeding the ducks. \nThe family have been able to enjoy a holiday in Wales and are looking forward to Gunner starting school in September and his fifth birthday the following month. \n\"We're incredibly lucky to have done it twice and for him to now be so well,\" Holly added. \nFollow BBC Shropshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

They remain in custody at this time for questioning.\nPolice are also investigating a related report of an assault on a bus driver.\nPeople living close to the Holiday Inn in Newton Heath where the violence broke have said they were upset and frightened by what happened.\nSamantha Skelton said she saw crowds in balaclavas shouting and throwing rocks and bottles before being chased by riot police. \nShe added the violence scared her elderly neighbour.\nThe disorder followed the killings of three girls at a dance class in Southport, where eight other children and two adults were also seriously injured on Monday.\nA 17-year-old boy, Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, has been charged with their murder and 10 counts of attempted murder. \nMr Burnham said the city region \"cannot descend into mob rule inspired by social media where half truths and half facts are whipping people up\".\nHe said there needed to be a \"return to calm\", and said the focus should be on the three bereaved families and others who have loved ones in hospital. \nMore than 100 people have been arrested in London as protests broke out across England on Wednesday, including in Hartlepool and Aldershot. \nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would meet senior police leaders to offer them his \"full backing\" in the face of ongoing unrest.\nMr Burnham added the police should be thanked for trying to keep people safe \"in these difficult times\", and not \"pelted with rocks and bottles\".\n\"Nothing justifies that at all.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "When a body was found in a quiet south Wales village, neither the locals nor the police could believe it.\nThere had not been a murder in Beddau for 20 years, according to one community officer - until the discovery of a well-preserved corpse in the back garden of a block of flats changed everything.\nThe remains were discovered by two friends, who believed they were cutting into a package containing a medical skeleton.\nThe story is now the subject of The Body Next Door, a documentary series examining who was responsible and how they got away with it for so long.\nWarning: Article contains spoilers\nThe body was found by Michelle James, a tenant of the Trem y Cwm flats, in November 2015.\nShe and a friend, Rhian Lee, had believed the strange package in the back garden contained a medical skeleton - and wanted to use it for a practical joke.\n\"We thought we'd bring it in, put it on the settee, and then knock the ceiling for the neighbour to come down just to play a prank,\" Ms Lee told the Sky documentary.\nWhen the friends started cutting the package open, they got fluid on their hands - and phoned the police.\nPC Joy Nicholls of South Wales Police, one of the first on the scene, said the smell was \"overwhelming\".\n\"It obviously wasn't a medical skeleton,\" she told the documentary.\nA pathologist suspected the body, which had been wrapped in up to 8in (20cm) of carpet and plastic, was weeks or months old.\nThey concluded that it was that of a man, aged in his 40s, who had died as a result of blunt-force trauma.\nMs James identified Leigh Sabine, a previous tenant of the flats, who had died one month earlier. \nShe said Mrs Sabine was the person who had told her that the package contained a medical skeleton.\nBut little was really known about Mrs Sabine - an \"eccentric\" woman who had told locals a number of stories about her past, including that her husband had left her.\nLynne Williams, Mrs Sabine's carer who looked after her until she died from terminal cancer in 2015, told the documentary: \"Leigh was always talking about a medical skeleton.\n\"On numerous occasions she wanted it moved and I would be like 'oh gosh, I really haven't got time to do things like that'.\n\"We were sitting around the table having a cup of tea and she mentioned the skeleton again and I said 'well I hope it's not a bleeding real one' and she went 'you never know Lynne'.\"\nThe police began to focus on Mrs Sabine's ex-husband, John Sabine. \nThe couple had moved to the flat together in 1997 and Mr Sabine appeared on the voting register and tenancy agreement - but nowhere else.\nThey soon discovered that the dead body was in fact Mr Sabine, and an inquest in 2016 concluded that he was unlawfully killed - most likely by his late wife.\nIt was suggested, though never proven, that she had used an ornamental frog to inflict his fatal head injuries.\nMr Sabine had not been seen for 18 years at the time his body was uncovered, and it is still unclear when exactly he died.\nThe inquest was told that Mr Sabine's body was well-preserved because of a process known as \"chemical mummification\", which can persist for years or even centuries.\n\"Precisely what happened and the circumstances will sadly never totally be known,\" coroner Andrew Barkley said.\nThe hearing was told Mrs Sabine admitted to killing her husband during a phone call with her friend Valerie Chalkley in 1997.\nIn written evidence, Ms Chalkley said: \"The problem with [Mrs Sabine] was you never knew if she was telling the truth or not.\"\nIn a further twist, it also emerged that John and Leigh Sabine had previously been investigated by police in New Zealand for abandoning their five children in the 1960s.\nJane Sabine, second youngest daughter of the Sabines, appeared at the end of the first episode of The Body Next Door, where she said: \"I have no doubt my mother was capable of murder.\"\nThe first episode of the Body Next Door, a three-part Sky Documentaries series, aired on Sunday at 21:00 BST.

    "The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is trying to save a rare British moth from extinction while also using its site for military training.\nThe rare dark-bordered beauty moth exists at one last known site in England, the military training area at Strensall Common near York.\nThe MoD, which owns the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) said it would be working with the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) and biologists from the University of York to try to protect the moth. \nRetired Major Patrick Ennis, of the DIO and MoD Strensall Conservation Group, said the needs of the military and the moth must be balanced.\n\"While the primary use of the land is to enable our military to train, we are equally committed to supporting nature recovery by balancing the conservation of species and their habitats with military training requirements,\" he said.\nThe moth's numbers have dwindled by more than 90% since records began at Strensall Common in 1894, and only 50 to 100 now remain in the 57-hectares of open heathland.\nThe moth eats and lays its eggs on creeping willow which grows at the edge of the common's woodland, but the willow is dwindling because of wildfires and grazing by sheep and cattle, and therefore so is the moth.\nTo help save the moth, the MoD said it was providing funding and materials for the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) to fence creeping willow which had been advised by  University of York biologists.\nVolunteers with the charity Butterfly Conservation were also growing more creeping willow from seed.\nDr Peter Mayhew, from the University, said the moth was of \"enormous cultural importance\".\n\"[This] was the population where the moth was first discovered in the UK,\" he said. \n\"The moth has only survived thanks to the protection of the heathland provided by the military training area. \n\"Seeing the moth fly on a sunny morning is a never-to-be-forgotten experience which future generations deserve to enjoy.\"\nThe local Yorventure charity has also provided funding and conservationists are considering a trial scheme for captive breeding of the moth around York.\nThe only other place the dark-bordered beauty moth can be found is in Scotland's Cairngorms, where a project saw 160 of the moths released in a bid to increase their population and save them from extinction.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "A Glasgow music venue devastated by fire is set to be demolished before the end of the year.\nThe O2 ABC, which dates back to 1875, was badly damaged in the Glasgow School of Art fire in June 2018. The site has lain empty ever since.\nIn January, urban regeneration company Vita Group unveiled plans to turn the former venue on the city's Sauchiehall Street into a food hall and student flats. \nA notice has been posted outside the fenced off entrance to the building, stating that all unstable areas of the building must be demolished.\nGlasgow City Council said a recent inspection prompted the need for a dangerous building notice to be served to protect public safety.\nA spokesperson said the areas of most immediate public safety concern were the fa\u00e7ade and the supporting timber floor structure directly behind it.\nPrevious proposals to demolish the site entirely in 2019 were met with strong opposition from politicians, music industry representatives and conservation groups.\nThe council notice requires the owners to demolish and remove the front and side facades along with the attached floor and roof structures and \"any other unstable, collapsed or affected and adjourning construction\".\nIt says a building warrant is not required and the work must begin by the end of September and be completed by 9 December 2024.\nAnd in a planning statement lodged at the end of July, the site's developers Vita Group set out the case for demolishing the site, pointing to the extent of damage and safety concerns around the building.\nThe firm noted that there would be \"significant and complex challenges\" in redeveloping the site.\nThe Vita Group wrote: \"While it is widely agreed that the building is beyond rescue, there are a number of elements within the historic fabric which the client and the design team are looking to salvage and reuse. \n\"A \u2018watching brief\u2019 is being provided and will be available on site to review the demolition process, with a view to salvaging historic items, wherever and whenever it is safe to do so.\"\nArchitect Niall Murphy, who is also director at Glasgow City Heritage Trust, said he was \"saddened\" to see the notice served.\nHe said: \"Though I am keen to see the ABC site regenerated and the blight affecting Sauchiehall Street addressed, I very much hoped that architect Charles McNair\u2019s classical entrance could be saved.\n\"It is worth retaining because it is a great example of the architecture of Glasgow\u2019s golden age of cinema and incorporates one of the best surviving Saracen Foundry cast iron building screens. Other examples of these include Selfridges in London.\n\"This grand entrance would be a handsome adornment to any new development while reminding Glaswegians of the ABC\u2019s fantastic social heritage. It would also be an excellent fit with emerging plans to turn Sauchiehall Street into a new cultural quarter for Glasgow.\u201d\nGlasgow City Council said temporary restraints were installed to reduce external danger after the fire damaged the stability of the fa\u00e7ade, but it remained the owner's responsibility to maintain the building.\nIt said a recent inspection prompted the need for a dangerous building notice to be served to protect public safety.\nA spokesperson for the council said: \"The areas of most immediate public safety concern are the fa\u00e7ade and the supporting timber floor structure directly behind and the notice is therefore stipulating the need for these to be removed.  \n\"After speaking with the building owners and their representatives, the dates within the notice are considered a reasonable time for the operations specified and aiming to complete at an appropriate point prior to the festive break. \n\"The dates can be varied should the necessity later arise.\"\nA spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotland said: \u201cIn 2019 we objected to an application for the proposed demolition of the category C listed O2 ABC building in Glasgow. \n\"However, having reviewed further information regarding the condition of the building, we accepted that the majority of it, including most of the front elevation, could not be retained in a meaningful way.

    "Filipino gymnast Carlos Yulo's feud with his mother has been making headlines in his home country, threatening to eclipse the euphoria over his historic twin gold medal wins in the Paris Olympics.\nAt the centre of the disagreement is how Angelica Poquiz-Yulo managed her 24-year-old son's finances and her reported disapproval of his girlfriend, a content creator on TikTok.\nIntense coverage of the spat - which has played out in interviews, social media posts  and even a hastily-arranged press conference - has prompted many to call on the media for restraint.\nMr Yulo is only the second Filipino to win an Olympic gold medal after weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz in the 2020 Tokyo games.\nHe is already a local celebrity and product endorser, with the twin medal haul only elevating his profile even higher while stirring national pride.\nHe will receive a 20 million-peso ($350,000; \u00a3273,000) cash bonus from the Philippine government. Corporate sponsors have pledged to give him a swanky condominium unit and a lifetime of free buffet meals and inasal, a local roasted chicken flavoured with lemongrass and ginger.\nThe capital city Manila has also started preparing festivities for his homecoming.\nBut soon after his second gold on Sunday, reports began to surface about an interview his mother had given to a local radio station that same day.\nIn that interview, Ms Yulo said that contrary to allegations, she did not mismanage her son's money and had in fact deposited it at a bank in Manila. She said she received money on her son's behalf.\nTwo days later, on 6 August, Mr Yulo released a video on TikTok, asking his mother where his past prize money had gone because he \"never received\" it.\nMr Yulo also said his Filipina girlfriend is not a \"red flag\" and that his mother had judged the woman because of her appearance and her liberal upbringing in Australia.\n\"My message to you, Ma, is I hope you heal and move on. I have forgiven you a long time ago. I pray that you are always safe and sound,\" Mr Yulo said in the TikTok video.\nMs Yulo then called for a press conference on 7 August to respond to her son's TikTok video and offered her hand in reconciliation.\nShe apologised for what she said in the interview, saying \"rapid questions\" from the media prevented her from thinking clearly.\nMs Yulo said she was issuing her \"final word\" on her disagreement with her son and that she was not after his money.\n\"This has reached an alarming level because now, the entire country is waiting for what each of us will say next, when this matter should have been kept private,\" she said.\n\"I am not a perfect mother and God knows that you are not a perfect son. There is no perfect family,\" she said.\nNeither mother nor son had spoken since that press conference late on Wednesday.\nOn social media, fans have called for an end to speculation over Mr Yulo's personal life, asking to shift attention back to his historic feat in Paris.\nFilipino audiences have a penchant for soap operas and gossip, especially when it involves public figures - who they are dating and how they are spending their money.\nThere is even a local slang for the chief gossip in the neighbourhood or the chat group - Marites, a common name for a Filipina woman.\nDuring the pandemic lockdowns, then president Rodrigo Duterte joked that too much time at home has turned the nation of 115 million people into the \"Republic of Marites\".\nBut in the case of Mr Yulo, media attention has gone too far, said prominent journalism professor Danilo Arao.\n\"Let us not dilute the outstanding achievements in the 2024 Paris Olympics by reporting on trivial matters that do not carry news values and do not shape public opinion,\" Prof Arao told the BBC.\nReporting on family feuds or personal problems of private individuals promotes an \"unacceptable culture of voyeurism and rumour-mongering\", he said.\nHe said coverage of Yulo's win should instead focus on the challenges facing Filipino athletes because of a lack of state support.\nThe Yulo family feud has also reignited conversations on social media on the expectations for children, under Filipino culture, to always obey their parents, even if they don't think that it is to their best interest.\nFor now, social media users have resumed swapping funny memes about the country's new sports star.\nOne disinfectant brand likened Yulo's charm to its germ-killing power -- 99.99% effective. Never mind the 0.01% that do not like him.\nFor Ms Yulo, she acknowledged that hurtful words have been said, but that they remain a family.\n\"Our home is open, whether or not you have money, the door is open in case you want to come back,\" she said.",

We want to do everything we can to support the community, to support the family.\"\nHe also said a \"fully documented safety plan\" had been in place and that safety personnel were on site throughout the event. \nCrossfit's decision to re-start the games drew the ire of some observers on social media. \n\"You'll keep pushing.

    "An explosion that wiped out half a town and killed dozens of people more than 150 years ago is being remembered.\nKnown as the \"guncotton explosion\", a build-up of vapours from chemically soaked cotton is thought to have caused the blast in Stowmarket, Suffolk, on 11 August 1871.\nTwenty-eight people were killed, including children, and more than 70 were left injured. The explosion was heard as far away as the coast.\nDarren Dordoy, chair of the Stowmarket Local History Group, said: \"There wouldn't have been anybody in the whole town that hadn't been affected in some way, shape or form.\"\nMr Dordoy said the explosion was \"violent\".\n\"So loud was this explosion it was heard 32 miles away in Southwold... such a violent explosion also... it lifted the farm barn up in the air and dropped it back down. \n\"When they investigated it later, it took an acre-and-a-half of barley out of the plant - the stalks were still standing, but the whole of the barley was gone.\" \nThe effects of the explosion remain in the town. He said St Mary's Church in Combs has clear glass in some former stained glass windows because it had never been replaced.\nThe Prentice Brothers' factory made chemical fertiliser and later ventured into a new, explosive guncotton, which was used as a replacement for gunpowder.\nMr Dordoy said the cotton was soaked in nitric and sulphuric acids, which should be rinsed to remove the excess and dried before being packed into boxes. \nHowever, on the day of the explosion, it was believed the cotton was not dry and on the hot day of 11 August 1871, chemical vapours built up in the boxes. \n\"When they went to move it, it should be perfectly safe to move... that build-up with chemicals and sudden movement is what they think caused the explosion,\" he said.\n\"A lot of families lost their main breadwinners.\"\nThe town rallied round and put money towards people who had no income, before putting a memorial in place. \n\"Humanity steps up to the plate,\" he said.\n\"The biggest thing about Stowmarket is the people that live in it. The heart of the communities of residents that have lived in the town for hundreds of years.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "For journalists, the Scottish Crime Campus is a place of tantalising secrets waiting to be told.\nThe four-storey building at Gartcosh in Lanarkshire resembles the swish headquarters of a financial company.\nInside, men and women chat over lattes in breakout areas scattered around a vast atrium. It's airy, impressive and a world away from a gritty old cop shop.\nBut behind the corporate good looks, what goes on here is deadly serious.\nSecurity is tight and filming severely restricted, in case a confidential document or someone in a sensitive role is caught on camera.\nAll those secrets are kept under wraps until cases go to court and convictions are secured.\nOpened in 2014 on the site of an old steelworks and modelled on the shape of a DNA particle, the \u00a373m campus now houses 1,100 workers from 18 key organisations.\nPolice rub shoulders with Scottish government officials, prosecutors, forensics, customs, environmental protection officers and even staff from the Department of Works and Pensions.\nThe idea was that bringing them together under one roof would increase collaboration and create a multi-agency intelligence led approach against serious and organised crime.\nEvery year the campus has 100 groups and 1,400 individuals under investigation. It says that annually, it dismantles and disrupts a third of those groups.\nTheir activities include drugs, smuggling firearms, human trafficking, child abuse and sexual exploitation, serious fraud, cyber crime and illegal dumping.\nThe campus's 10th anniversary celebrations highlighted a series of successes against big name criminals, many of whom were extradited to Scotland after hiding abroad.\nPeople like Christopher Hughes, now serving life over the murder of a crime blogger outside a sex club in the Netherlands.\nMillions of pounds worth of drugs were seized by Operation Venetic, which followed the dismantling of an encrypted communication service used by crooks.\nIn the last year, inquiries have led to the discovery of \u00a320m of cocaine, \u00a33m of heroin and \u00a36m of cannabis.\nKenny Donnelly, deputy crown agent at the Crown Office, Scotland's prosecution service, said some of the people they\u2019ve jailed thought they were untouchable.\nA total of 952 serious organised crime gang members have been imprisoned in the last five years.\nBut that success has to be seen in the context of Scotland\u2019s death rate from drugs, for years the worst in the UK and the rest of Europe.\nThe whack-a-mole nature of the fight against drugs - jail one gangster and another pops up - means it\u2019s a never ending challenge.\nPolice Scotland's Chief Constable Jo Farrell said: \"That is the way the market operates, but it's our role to make sure that environment is as hostile as possible.\n\"You've seen over the years the many successes we've had in that space but some of this is also about education, economic development and the prosperity of communities.\"\nMs Farrell talks of the importance of tackling organised crime with specialist officers like those at Gartcosh and also through community policing.\nBut at the end of June, officer numbers at Police Scotland were down to 16,200, a 16-year low.\nMs Farrell said that this year, the force will recruit more new officers than ever before, taking its strength back towards the target of 16,600.\nAssistant Chief Constable Andy Freeburn chairs the board which oversees the work of the crime campus.\nHe predicts more integration, a further \"blurring of the lines\" between different agencies.\nThey're exploring the creation of a centralised analytical hub and a single command centre to deal with cyber crime.\n\"Integration is the next step beyond collaboration,\" he said.\nPresumably, much will depend on protecting the campus from budget cuts.\nMs Farrell admits that for her force, financial pressures are once again a worry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re planning for,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve faced it before in 2008 and 2009 in England and let\u2019s hope that the impact isn\u2019t as detrimental as it was in the past.\n\u201cWe will plan and work in partnership to drive efficiencies.\n\u201cWe will make a very, very strong case to the Scottish Government as to why Police Scotland should be funded well.\u201c",

My husband works full-time. I can't be in three places at the same time, twice a day.\"\nThe council said it had maintained support for families to make their own arrangements, with extra help for those most affected. \nMs Aziz's son Adam, 18, has severe learning difficulties, autism and epilepsy. \nFor 10 years the council has provided a minibus and a carer to take him to school, which is around 6 miles away from their home in Acocks Green.\n\"Adam is severely learning disabled. He's an 18 year old with the brain of a one-year-old. He has no sense of danger. He can't be independently travel trained and we have a plethora of evidence from experts. This is a budget-centred response.\"\nSolicitors Irwin Mitchell, acting on Ms Aziz's behalf have submitted a formal letter before action to the council.  \nIt claims the council didn't give regard to statutory guidance or comply with equality legislation when determining the assistance required. \nMother-of-three Ms Aziz runs a support group, Special Educational Needs and Disability Parent Action Group (SENDPAG), and said other parents were also considering legal action.\n\"It feels like a very important fight. It shouldn't be the case that our disabled young people should lose out on their education, because the service has to save millions of pounds through no fault of our own.\"\nBirmingham City Council said last month it had to make a further \u00a380m in savings in the next financial year, on top of \u00a3300m over two years already announced. \nThe Children's, Young People and Families department needs to find \u00a351.5m savings in the next financial year.\nThe Labour-run authority said: \"An extensive consultation process was carried out to make parents aware of the changes which were communicated through schools and other stakeholders.\"\n\"The council has maintained a level of support that enables families to make their own arrangements and has been providing additional support to our most vulnerable students and families.\"\nIrwin Mitchell has given the council until 13 August to respond to the letter. If a resolution isn't found, solicitors will seek to launch a judicial review of the case. \nSolicitor Erika Wright from Irwin Mitchell said: \"The council has a duty to provide a home-to-school transport policy to facilitate attendance at school. \n\"We believe the new policy is unlawful because a personal transport budget doesn't meet the needs of learners with a high level of need, such as Adam.\"\nMs Wright said that parents of SEND children have an ongoing fight to get what their children need, and feel like they face \"hurdle after hurdle\".\n\"We have put forward legal arguments to support our client's case, which is that every child and young person of sixth form age has a legal right to be able to get to their place of education,\" she added.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on Facebook, X and Instagram.

More than 195,000 people had been expected to attend.\nLocal media have also reported that the 19-year-old had stolen chemicals from his former workplace.\nThe Kurier newspaper, citing sources, reported that he used to work at a metal processing company in his home town of Ternitz, and that he had made progress in building a bomb.\nThe outlet also reported that he had planned to drive a car into the crowd expected to gather outside the stadium.\nSecurity officials at a news conference on Thursday did not comment on where he got the chemicals, but public security chief Franz Ruf told reporters that chemical substances and technical devices found at the main suspect's house showed \"concrete preparatory actions\".\nThe head of Austria's Directorate for Protection of the State and Intelligence (DSN) Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, said weapons were seized from the main suspect's house, and that \"his aim was to kill himself and a large crowd of people either today or tomorrow at the concert\".\nMr Ruf added the teen had posted a video online confessing to the plot, quit his job at the end of last month and told people that he had \"big plans\".\nThey also revealed that the main suspect - an Austrian citizen who was born there but who had North Macedonian parents - had recently changed his appearance and \"adapted it to Islamic State propaganda\", and had been consuming and sharing Islamist propaganda online.\nA second suspect - a 17-year-old Austrian of Turkish or Croatian heritage - was employed at a company which would have \"provided services\" at the stadium where Swift was to perform.\nThe 19- and 17-year-olds have been remanded in custody.\nA 15-year-old, who was \"in the area\" of the stadium at the time, is being questioned.\nDespite officials saying that they were not looking for any more suspects, a third - an 18-year-old Iraqi citizen - was arrested in Vienna on Thursday evening, Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said.\nThe man is also believed to have sworn an oath of allegiance to IS.\nSpeaking at the briefing on Thursday, Mr Karner said \"a tragedy was averted\", and the attack was foiled with the help of international intelligence as Austrian law does not allow censorship of messenger applications.\n\"The terrorist threat has intensified throughout Europe and Austria was and is no exception,\" he said, adding that major concerts are \"often a favourite target of Islamist attackers\".\nColdplay are due to perform seven concerts in Vienna from 21 August as part of their Spheres World Tour.\nMr Haijawi-Pirchner said there was no information suggesting a specific threat to upcoming events in Austria, but security measures remain high.\nSwift's Vienna concerts were part of the European leg of her Eras Tour, which began in Paris in May.\nThe tour has made stops in a number of countries including Sweden, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Poland.\nSwift is set to head to London to perform five shows at Wembley Stadium next week.\nUK policing minister Diana Johnson said Scotland Yard would look at intelligence ahead of the Wembley Stadium dates.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan has told Sky News that the city will \"carry on\" and that the police will work with City Hall and councils to ensure the concerts take place safely.",
    "A Welsh actress has described how obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) after she gave birth made her fear she was a danger to her baby.\nKimberley Nixon, the star of Channel 4 sitcom Fresh Meat, said the natural worries about her baby's well-being escalated into deep anxiety.\nOCD is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours.\n\"I was just convinced that I wasn't doing things right. I wasn't feeding him right. What temperature is he supposed to be?\" she said.\n\"Every time he cried I was just sort of shaking - I just got really hyper vigilant and terrified.\"\nKimberley was eventually diagnosed with perinatal OCD, which is when you experience OCD during pregnancy or in the first year after giving birth.\nHowever, prior to the diagnosis, she said every time she looked online for help, all of the advice was about \"baby blues and feeling sad\".\n\"I didn\u2019t feel sad, I felt scared,\" she said.\nThe Pontypridd actress, who also featured in the films Wild Child and Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, had IVF to conceive her much-longed for son.\nHe arrived during the pandemic in 2020 and, after a traumatic birth, Kimberly soon began to have disturbing thoughts that she might accidentally hurt him.\n\"Those thoughts -  it was like what could happen to him? How can I protect him? - they morphed into what if you're a danger to your baby?\" she told Radio Wales\u2019 Books That Made Me with Lucy Owen.\n\"What if you're so tired that you drop him or what if you just snap and become a completely different person?\n\"Now objectively, I can see that wouldn't have happened, but you can become really unwell with it like I did.\n\"You don't know what's real anymore and you don't trust yourself.\n\"And so this baby, that I loved so much, that was finally here, I was terrified to go near because I didn't want anything bad to happen to him.\"\nPerinatal OCD is when you experience OCD during pregnancy or in the year after childbirth.\nYou may also hear the disorder being referred to as postpartum OCD.\nIt often, but not always, revolves around significant fear of harm coming to your baby, with the worries often focused on accidentally or deliberately harming your baby.\nThe NHS says \"it is important to note that this is completely normal and very common to occasionally experience these worries\".\nSimon Jones, of Mind Cymru, said it is \"normal\" to worry about your baby's wellbeing, and to want to protect your baby.\n\"If you start to experience obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours that affect your daily life and wellbeing, you may be experiencing perinatal OCD,\" he added.\n\u201cThe obsessions and compulsions are likely to relate to feelings about being a parent and your baby.\u201d\nThe National Childbirth Trust says that in pregnancy, the rate of OCD may be as high as 5% and postnatally 9%, with rates of OCD similar in men and women.\nKimberley said she had never heard of perinatal OCD until she was diagnosed.\n\"I became really poorly after he was born, but I wasn't quite ticking any of the postnatal depression boxes,\" she said. \n\"And that scares you, when you're not kind of fitting into a diagnosis, and nobody seemed to know what to do with me.\n\"OCD to me was being very neat and liking things in a certain way - I'm one of the messiest people I know, I drive my husband insane, I wasn't doing any of the compulsion bit of OCD.\n\"All of my compulsions were mental. So it was really invisible and really hard to read, hard to pick up on.\"\nMr Jones explained: \u201cOCD has two main parts: obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are unwelcome thoughts, feelings, images, urges, worries or doubts that keep coming into your mind.\n\"Compulsions are repetitive things that you do to reduce the distress or uncertainty caused by obsessions.\"\nHe said there remains a stigma around perinatal mental health issues, but Mind Cymru is encouraging anyone who thinks they may be affected, to seek support.\n\"It can be hard to open up and talk to someone about your obsessions or compulsions, which may lead to the condition not being diagnosed and lead to feelings of isolation.\"\nKimberley has more than a quarter of a million followers on Instagram and she's been sharing her mental health journey on the social media platform to raise awareness of the condition.\n\"I started to be very honest about my condition, while I was still very poorly with postnatal mental illness,\" she said. \n\"Over the last three years, I've had thousands and thousands of messages. And from everybody - men, women, new mothers with two-week-olds.\"\nShe said she decided, while at her lowest point and being unable to find anyone to relate with online, that she wanted to be there for people going through a similar experiences in the future.\nKimberley is now recovering and adores spending time with her little boy.\n\"I've got this incredible relationship with my son, that I was so worried I would never have,\" she said.\n\"So I really want people to know that you can, and will, get better and that it c",
    "The British Medical Association (BMA) has called for the ban on puberty blockers for under-18s to be lifted.\nThe doctors\u2019 union also wants a pause on the implementation of a landmark review into gender care for children and young people.\nIt said it wanted to undertake an evaluation of the Cass Review after academics expressed concern about its approach.\nThe review, commissioned by NHS England, called for a move away from medical interventions for children struggling with their gender identity and advocated a more holistic model incorporating better mental health support.\nIt took four years to carry out and was widely welcomed by the medical establishment in the UK.\nThe review was led by leading paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass and prompted the last government to ban the use of puberty blockers for under-18s questioning their gender \u2013 a move which was then supported by Labour when they won the election. \nThese drugs suppress the natural production of hormones and delay the onset of puberty.\nThe ban applied to private clinics, because the NHS had already stopped using them outside of clinical trials, and was challenged in the High Court by campaign group TransActual.\nBut a judge ruled earlier this week that the ban was lawful.\n\nThe BMA said members of its Council, its top decision-making body, voted in favour of a motion last month that was critical of the Cass Review and called on the union to \"publicly critique\" it.\nThe BMA said it was concerned about its impact on transgender healthcare provision because of its \"unsubstantiated recommendations\".\nIt pointed to one piece of research published online earlier this year as a sign that academics were concerned about the way the Cass Review was carried out.\nBMA leader Prof Philip Banfield said: \"This is a highly specialised area of healthcare and as doctors we want to be sure they get the most appropriate care and support they need.\"\nIt said it expected its evaluation to be finished by the end of the year \u2013 and said it wanted to see a pause on the implementation of the Cass Review recommendations in the meantime.\nA spokesperson for the Cass Review defended the way it was carried out.\nIt said the University of York undertook the largest and most comprehensive review of evidence on the subject seen, looking at 237 papers from 18 countries, as part of its evidence-gathering process.\nThe spokesperson said the review also consulted widely with those with lived experience, health staff and leading experts in the field.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"The Cass Review is a robust report backed by clinicians and firmly grounded in evidence.\n\"NHS England will be implementing Dr Cass's recommendations so that children and young people get the safe, holistic care and support they need.

    "A lone fisherman was \"fortunate\" to avoid injury when their vessel capsized off Exmouth's coast, investigators have said.\nA Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) report was published earlier into the Angelena's sinking on 18 June, 2021 as its skipper landed a catch.\nThe report said the boat had not been required to meet any stability standard and the skipper could not maintain a safe navigational watch while alone.\nIt recommended that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency require stability training before issuing competency certificates and the boat's captain should complete a stability awareness course.\nThe MAIB said the capsizing happened eight nautical miles south-east of Exmouth after the Angelena's net - which was full of sand, mud and fish - swung away from the vessel's side.\nIt said the captain - who was wearing a life jacket - did not have time to raise the alarm before entering the water, where they were rescued by another boat.\nThe report said despite the boat having several modifications since it was built in 1988, it had not been required to undergo a stability assessment.\nConsequently, it said the skipper did not understand the stability performance of their own vessel, which had set sail from Brixham.\n\"Although experienced and qualified, the skipper was unaware of the vessel\u2019s accumulated stability risks and the hazards they posed,\" the MAIB said.\n\"The skipper was fortunate to enter the water uninjured and be able to inflate and board Angelena\u2019s life raft and raise the alarm.\"\nThe MAIB concluded the Maritime and Coastguard Agency needed to improve fishermens' understanding of stability and require risk assessments to define minimum crewing levels.\nIt added the skipper of the Angelena should attend a stability awareness course.\nThe MAIB said: \"Recommendations have been made to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to improve fishers\u2019 understanding of stability, require risk assessments that define minimum crewing levels for fishing operations and align definitions across its notices and publications.\n\"A recommendation has also been made to the skipper of Angelena to attend the Seafish Advanced Stability Awareness course.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A famous 190-million-year-old rock formation in southern Utah known as the \"Double Arch\" has collapsed, according to national park officials. \nThe popular natural phenomenon - which covered Lake Powell in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area - crumbled last week, according to the National Park Service. \nNo one was injured when the rock formation fell down at the popular hiking spot. \nPark rangers said changing water levels and erosion may have contributed to the collapse. \n\"[T]his event serves as a reminder of our responsibility and need to protect the mineral resources surrounding Lake Powell,\u201d said Glen Canyon National Recreation Area superintendent Michelle Kerns. \nThe rocks that formed Double Arch - also known as the \"toilet bowl\" because of the large hole in the formation - consisted of fine-grained Navajo sandstone from the late Triassic to early Jurassic periods, the National Park Service said. \nBut over time, the formation had begun to crumble and erode with wind and rain, the agency said. \nMs Kerns said the rock formation may have been influenced or damaged by \"manmade interventions\". \nWater levels in Lake Powell have fallen steadily since 1999 due to global warming that has made the western US hotter and drier, according to NASA.  Water levels rose this year after reaching historic lows in 2023, but have not fully rebounded to 1999, when the lake was near capacity. \nThe rock formation was a popular hiking destination. In 2023, over 5 million people visited the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which spans 1.25 million acres in Utah and Arizona. \nSeveral people took to social media to mourn the loss of the famed arches. One user posted a video of the rock formation hovering above Lake Powell just a day before the collapse. Another said she had a picture of her mother floating below the rock in an inner tube from 1969. \n\"Sad to see it go,\" she posted. \nUtah's parks are home to many arch-like rock formations, including in Arches and Zion National Park.

    "An SDLP MP has said she and party colleagues discussed forming a new party in 2019. \nClaire Hanna told the BBC's Red Lines podcast the discussions took place against the backdrop of the now-ended partnership between the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Fianna F\u00e1il. \nThe new relationship was backed by the majority of SDLP elected representatives and members but a significant minority remained unhappy. \nMany felt it was a precursor to a formal merger between the two parties.\n\u201cAt that time, in those few months, I did think my time in elected political life was possibly coming to an end if that [partnership] had gone in the trajectory we and others thought it was going to. \n\"I thought deeply about where I fitted. I didn\u2019t think that I fitted into any of the existing political vehicles that were around,\u201d she told Red Lines.\n\u201cI was the only MLA who didn\u2019t support the partnership but I wasn\u2019t the only person. There were quite a few councillors and activists who didn\u2019t.\n\"We did discuss what something might look like,\u201d she added.\nMs Hanna was recently re-elected as the MP for Belfast South and Mid Down with a majority of more than 12,000 votes.  \nHer family is steeped in SDLP history. \nHer father is a former general secretary of the party and her mother served in the Stormont Executive.\n\u201cI genuinely think that something like the SDLP, a party with a history, values and a heritage, should exist,\" she told the podcast. \n\"If the SDLP disappeared into a Fianna F\u00e1il vehicle, then that wouldn\u2019t have existed\u201d, she added.\nIn September 2022 the party signalled the end of the partnership, with party leader Colum Eastwood saying his party needed to stand on his own two feet.  \n\u201cThings moved and changed. The institutions came back and the Brexit process jumped us on so, thankfully, that didn\u2019t need to go anywhere but I did have to consider the possibility that my time in the SDLP was over,\" she said. \n\"It was very difficult,\u201d she added.\nMs Hanna said she understood why the party leader explored the partnership.  \nShe said that 2019 was a \"very bleak place for the SDLP\". \n\"We had no MPs.

    "Tens of thousands of women who have gone through the menopause might benefit from a new bone-strengthening drug, says the medicines watchdog National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).  \nAbaloparatide can protect against the bone-thinning condition called osteoporosis, which causes a high risk of broken bones in older age. \nIt will become available on the NHS in England within the next three months, says NICE. \nThe injection, which comes as a pre-filled pen that people can self-administer at home once a day, encourages cells to make new bone. \n\nOther osteoporosis treatments are already available, but this new one is an alternative for people who have not responded to, or who cannot tolerate, those. \nAlison Smith, who was diagnosed with osteoporosis in 2011, told BBC R4's Today programme the new treatment would make a \"big difference\" to many patients who are \"reluctant\" to take medication currently available \"because of side effects\".\nThe new drug is \"a very well-tolerated treatment\" for most people, according to Dr Nicky Peel, a clinical trustee at the Royal Osteoporosis Society and metabolic bone physician based in Sheffield.\nSpeaking on the Today programme, Dr Peel said while some people experience nausea, headaches and palpitations - often during the early stages of treatment -  Abaloparatide is suitable for most people at high risk of bone fracture.\nHowever, she warned the \"challenge\" is to ensure patients have access to \"appropriate diagnostic services\" that would identify their need for the drug.\nPeople will be offered drug treatment if doctors think they are at a high enough risk of breaking a bone. \nTheramex, which makes the medication, has agreed an undisclosed price with the NHS. \nBy the time people are in their mid-20s, bone strength will have peaked.\nFrom then, it naturally declines. \nIf bone loss is severe though, they can easily fracture even after a minor bump or fall.\nGetting enough vitamin D and calcium is also important for bone health. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) around the time of menopause can help too. \nWomen are more at risk of developing osteoporosis than men because of hormone changes that happen with the menopause.\nOestrogen levels drop, which can weaken the bones.\nProf Jonathan Benger, chief medical officer and deputy chief executive at NICE, said: \"The independent committee heard from patients about how debilitating osteoporosis can be.\n\"Our focus is on enabling access to care that improves quality of life while offering value to the taxpayer.\"\nMore than three million people have osteoporosis in the UK. \nThe prevalence increases markedly with age -  about 2% of women aged 50 have it compared with almost half of women who are 80, says NICE.\nMore than one in three women and one in five men will sustain one or more osteoporotic fractures in their lifetime.",
    "A Virginia man has been charged with making violent threats on social media against Kamala Harris shortly after she began her campaign for president. \nFrank Carillo, 66, of Winchester, faced court on Monday over threatening messages posted on GETTR, a conservative social media platform.\nOne stated Ms Harris \"needs to be put on fire alive\", while another said she would \"regret ever trying to become president\".\nMr Carillo was arrested on 2 August. FBI agents seized an AR15-style rifle, a handgun, and thousands of rounds of ammunition in a search of his home.\nInvestigators allege that Mr Carillo did \"knowingly and willfully make a threat to take the life of and to inflict bodily harm\" against Ms Harris.\nThe federal complaint says 4,359 messages were found threatening various people or groups, including 19 directed at Ms Harris.\nCourt documents showed other messages included \"AR15 locked and loaded\", and threats to \"kill all Muslims\" and shoot \"illegals... in the head\". \nThe messages in the documents relating to Ms Harris are from 27 July - the date of her first campaign fundraiser and less than a week after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed her. \n\"This is ridiculous, for a comment,\" Mr Carillo said during the search of his home, according to the documents. \"I guess I'm gonna need a lawyer.\"\nMaking a threat against the president, vice-president or others in the line of presidential succession carries a prison sentence of up to five years.\nThe investigation began after threats were reported against the keeper of voter registration records in Arizona's Maricopa County, Stephen Richer. \nMr Richer was known for pushing back against false claims of election fraud four years ago.\nGETTR and Google helped the FBI in its investigation. \nRepublicans and Democrats have condemned the growing trend of political violence, especially after last month's assassination attempt on Donald Trump, who was injured in the attack. \nGETTR was originally founded by Jason Miller, Trump's chief spokesman. He left when he joined the 2024 Trump presidential campaign last year. \nMr Carillo has requested a lawyer and is next due to appear in court on Thursday.",
    "The first images have been released of Michael Sheen playing Prince Andrew in a drama based on his notorious BBC interview.\nThe Welsh actor portrays the Duke of York in A Very Royal Scandal, when he spoke to Emily Maitlis on BBC Two's Newsnight.\nThe three-part drama, produced by Amazon MGM Studios, shows how he declared his innocence following accusations about his involvement with Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager.\nAlongside Sheen as Prince Andrew, the series stars Ruth Wilson as Emily Maitlis.\nMs Giuffre alleged that the incidents took place in London, New York, and the Virgin Islands after being introduced to the duke by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nThis is not the first time the interview has been adapted for the big screen, with Netflix\u2019s Scoop starring Rufus Sewell as Prince Andrew and Gillian Anderson as Emily Maitlis having already been released.\nSheen is known for his transformative performances, and has put his own spin on figures such as TV presenters David Frost, in Frost/Nixon, and Chris Tarrant in the ITV drama Quiz, and football manager Brian Clough in The Damned United. \nA Very Royal Scandal is said to be no different, with Sheen reflecting Prince Andrew\u2019s mannerisms.\nThe actor is known for combining acting with activism on issues such as homelessness, and earlier this year directed and starred in BBC Wales' The Way, a fictional story set in his home town of Port Talbot and its threatened steelworks. \n\nA Very Royal Scandal is the latest in Amazon\u2019s Scandal series, which has seen the online streamer collaborate with the BBC on A Very British Scandal and A Very English Scandal.\nAmazon MGM Studios said the series would demonstrate \u201cthe power of journalism through a pivotal moment in British history.\u201d\nThe cast also includes Joanna Scanlan as Amanda Thirsk, Alex Jennings as Sir Edward Young,  \u00c9anna Hardwicke as Stewart Maclean and Claire Rushbrook as Sarah Ferguson.\nA Very Royal Scandal will debut on Prime Video on 19 September.",
    "Sweden's public health agency has recorded what it says is the first case of a more dangerous type of mpox outside the African continent.\nThe person became infected during a stay in an area of Africa where there is currently a major outbreak of mpox Clade 1, the agency said.\nThe news comes just hours after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreak of mpox in parts of Africa was now a public health emergency of international concern.\nAt least 450 people died during an initial outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the disease has since spread to areas of Central and East Africa.\nAccording to Olivia Wigzell, the acting head of the Swedish public health agency, the infected person had sought care in the Stockholm area and the fact that they were receiving treatment in Sweden did not mean there was a risk to the broader population.\n\"The affected person has also been infected during a stay in an area of Africa where there is a large outbreak of mpox Clade 1,\" she told a news conference.\nMpox, which was previously known as monkeypox, is transmitted through close contact, such as sex, skin-to-skin contact and talking or breathing close to another person.\nIt causes flu-like symptoms, skin lesions and can be fatal, with four in 100 cases leading to death. It is most common in the tropical rainforests of West and Central Africa and there are thousands of infections every year.\nThere are currently a number of outbreaks of mpox that are taking place simultaneously and they are partly fuelled by the newer and more serious type of Clade 1b, identified in September last year.\nThere are two types of Clade 1 and the Swedish case has been identified as Clade 1b. Since mpox Clade 1b was first witnessed in Democratic Republic of Congo there have been confirmed cases in Burundi, Kenya and Rwanda, before the new case identified in Sweden.\nWhile Clade 2 did cause a public health emergency in 2022, it was relatively mild and some 300 cases have already been identified in Sweden.\nWHO/Europe said it was actively engaging with Sweden's health authorities on \"how best to manage the first confirmed case of mpox Clade 1b\".\nIt urged other countries to act quickly and transparently like Sweden, as there were likely to be further \"imported cases of Clade 1 in the European region over the coming days and weeks\".\nThe Swedish public health agency said the more dangerous outbreak was likely to be linked to \"a higher rise of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality\".\nDr Jonas Albarnaz, who specialises in pox viruses at the Pirbright Institute, said the first case outside of Africa was concerning as it meant the spread \u201cmight be larger than we knew yesterday\u201d.\nDr Brian Ferguson, Associate Professor of Immunology at the University of Cambridge agreed it was \"clearly a concerning development\" but unsurprising given the severity and spread of the outbreak in Africa.\nThe WHO hopes its latest declaration, that mpox is a public health emergency of international concern, will trigger greater support to the areas most affected.\nVaccines are available, for those at greatest risk or who have been in close contact with an infected person, but many experts worry there are not enough jabs or funding to get them to the people who need them most.\nThe mortality rate from the Clade 1b variant in Sweden will not be as high as that seen in parts of Africa, because of the high quality of healthcare in Europe.\nHowever, Dr Ferguson said there would likely be further cases in Europe and other parts of the world \"as there are currently no mechanisms in place to stop imported cases of mpox happening\".\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said symptoms usually appeared 6-13 days after infection, through fevers and headaches, rashes or sores and muscle ache.\nMost people experienced mild to moderate symptoms followed by a full recovery, but immuno-compromised individuals were at greater risk.\nWhile news of the first case outside Africa may cause alarm, it was to be expected.\nAs other disease outbreaks have shown, swift international action can help stop the disease spreading further.",
    "A Detroit judge has been temporarily taken off the bench after he forced a 15-year-old girl to wear handcuffs and a jail uniform because she appeared to fall asleep during a field trip to his court.\nDistrict Court Judge Kenneth King said he did not like Eva Goodman's \"attitude\" and said he wanted to show her \"how you are to conduct yourself in a courtroom\".\nThe teenager was visiting the 36th District Court for a trip organised by the environmental charity The Greening, whose other excursions include kayaking and bird-watching. \nOn Thursday, the chief judge of the 36th District Court, William McConico, said in a statement that he had conducted a \"swift and thorough internal investigation\" of the incident and decided to temporarily take Mr King off his cases to undergo \"necessary training\". \n\u201cWe sincerely hope that this incident does not undermine our longstanding relationships with local schools,\u201d Judge McConio said. \nThe girl's mother, Latoreya Hill, told local news: \"Would you want someone to treat your child like that?\n\"To belittle her in front of the whole world and her friends, to make her feel even more worse about her situation.\"\nVideo from the court shows Judge King telling Ms Hill's daughter: \"One thing you'll learn about my courtroom is that I'm not a toy. I am not to be played with.\" \nHe asked other visitors on the trip to vote if he should put Eva in a juvenile detention centre, before deciding to have her handcuffed and dressed in a jail outfit before releasing her. \n\"It was her whole attitude and her whole disposition that disturbed me,\" the judge said in interviews afterwards. \n\"I wanted to get through to her, show how serious this is,\" he said, adding: \"I'll do whatever needs to be done to reach these kids and make sure that they don't end up in front of me.\"\nIn the video of the incident, Judge King tells Eva: \"You sleep at home in your bed, not in court.\"\nHer mother, however, said Eva did not have \"her own bed that she can sleep in\". \n\"She was tired,\" Ms Hill, a single mother of two, said. \"I'm trying my best.\" \nJudge Aliyah Sabree, who has the No 2 leadership post at the court, said on Wednesday that said Mr King's actions did \"not reflect the standards\" of the court and would be \"addressing this matter with the utmost diligence\".\nMr King said he stood by his decisions. \"I wanted this to look and feel very real to her, even though there's probably no real chance of me putting her in jail,\" he said.  \n\"That was my own version of Scared Straight.\"",
    "An environmental project has been launched to help protect one of the world's 200 chalk streams.\nThe Environment Agency and Norfolk Rivers Trust said the scheme to support wildlife will also provide natural flood management along a section of the River Glaven near Bayfield in north Norfolk.\nThe river is a chalk stream that flows through north Norfolk into the North Sea and its surrounding floodplain habitat. \nThe project involves restoring a river channel and meandering it through a dynamic mosaic of newly created floodplain wetlands.\nChalk streams are a rare global habitat, mostly concentrated in southern England, including 58 in East Anglia.\nIt is hoped the two-year project will improve the condition and connectivity of the River Glaven floodplain, and in turn enhance habitat diversity and benefit water quality, the Environment Agency said.\nIt has provided \u00a370,000 in funding, with an additional \u00a360,000 contributed through other sources. \nThe Environment Agency said the scheme would \"naturally filter the water, thereby improving its quality and reducing nutrient loading in the Glaven, recognised as both a priority habitat and a County Wildlife Site\". \n\"The wetlands would also enhance water storage in high flows, providing natural flood management and increased ground infiltration,\" it added.\nJonah Tosney, technical director at Norfolk Rivers Trust, said: \"We excavated an existing straight ditch, possibly an old course of the River Glaven, and meandered it through the floodplain to slow the flow of water. \n\"Old dredging embankments were removed from the river's edge to restore the natural overflow on to the floodplain, and a series of new wetland pools and scrapes were also created to maximise wildlife benefits.\n\"We look forward to the site further naturalising, with rough and varied vegetation encouraged through grazing practices.\n\"The enhanced habitat is already being used by frogs, eels, egrets and otters, which is really promising, and we hope additional species will move in such as water-voles and grass-snakes.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Train company TransPennine Express (TPE) has lost its contract after months of poor performance.\nIt will cease to operate its routes across the North of England and Scotland on 28 May, with control passing to the government.\nBBC News analysed official figures from industry regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), to examine how TPE's services have fared in recent months.\nTPE's services began to experience ongoing disruption in early 2022.\nThe company said it was affected by high staff sickness levels and the coronavirus pandemic delaying the training of new drivers.\nThis has been compounded by its lack of an agreement with unions for drivers to work voluntary overtime. The union Aslef has accused the company of relying on this instead of recruiting enough staff.By December, TPE was one of three operators said by the government to be responsible for \"unacceptable\" services across the North of England.\nThe latest figures show TPE cancelled about one in six (16.9%) of its services in March - the highest rate of any train company, but an improvement on January and February, which saw about a quarter of services cancelled.\nMost cancellations happened up to 22:00 the night before the service was scheduled due to a lack of staff, a practice known as \"pre-cancelling\" or \"p-coding\".\nThe main purpose of pre-cancellations is to adjust emergency timetables when poor weather or infrastructure damage requires unexpected changes.\nFigures on these additional cancellations have only been published since February, after the ORR asked train companies to provide the data to reflect the true impact on passengers. It means a full comparison with previous months is not available.\nThe timeliness of TPE trains improved slightly in the latest figures to March, after a sharp decline in September.\nAbout half of services arrived late, which is defined as a minute or more after the scheduled time. For all operators in Great Britain overall it was 29%.\nWhile figures suggest the company's current punctuality rates have improved on the period before the pandemic, they do not take into account the fact that the number of services has been reduced by around a third. \nThere was a similar trend in longer delays. In March 5.7% of trains arrived later than 15 minutes after the scheduled time, an improvement on December but still about triple the score for all operators.\nIn December, when there was disruption due to industrial action, TPE recorded the lowest number of trains planned in timetables since records began in 2016, at about 3,500.\nThe company planned to run about 6,000 trains in March. This was slightly more than planned over the same period in 2022, but about 2,500 fewer than in 2020.\nThese figures only count the number of planned services, before on-the-day cancellations are made.\nIncluding trains cancelled the previous day - which are removed from the official figures and do not count as being planned - at one point TPE timetabled about 6,600 trains in March.\nThe government has chosen to bring TPE under public control with the Operator of Last Resort (OLR) from the end of May.\nThe OLR, effectively a government-run train company, manages rail contracts that are brought into public ownership, with a view of eventually returning them to the private sector.\nUnder the OLR, the government has said services will run as normal with no changes to tickets, timetables or planned services, but the overall aim is to improve performance.\nNorthern, London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and Southeastern are also run by the OLR.\nFirstGroup, the company which owns TPE, said it was disappointed by the government's decision not to renew the contract it has run in various forms since 2004.\n\"Our team have worked extremely hard to improve services, including by recruiting and training more drivers than ever before,\" said Graham Sutherland, FirstGroup's chief executive.\nAdditional reporting by Wesley Stephenson and Hope Bolger",
    "Top degree grades are awarded to about three in every 10 students at Northern Ireland's universities, new figures show.\nThe proportion of students achieving first-class degrees in Northern Ireland in 2022-23 was 29% - a slight fall from the previous year - figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) show\nAcross the UK as a whole, the number of top degrees awarded is about 50% higher than a decade ago.\nStatistics also show that the number of international students in Northern Ireland has increased in recent years.\nUniversities award undergraduate degrees in four broad results classifications - first class honours, upper second class (2:1), lower second class (2:2), and third class or pass.\nUniversities are their own degree-awarding bodies, so decide grades based on things such as exams, coursework, theses or practical work from students.\nAnna Jonak from Portadown in County Armagh recently graduated from Queen's University Belfast with a first-class degree in psychology.\nShe started her degree in 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic and said the transition from daily in-person classes to fully remote learning was really challenging.\n\"Time management was really hard, from being in a classroom where the teacher goes through everything with you, to sitting at home and having everything online - I didn't think I would do well,\" she told BBC News NI.\nAnna sat all her exams remotely apart from her final year.\n\"We initially had 24 hours to answer a question and it was all open-book, then for final year we were brought back in-person and under time constraints so that was really hard,\" she said.\n\"When I found out I got a first I was so shocked, I was walking around for ages thinking 'did that really happen'. \n\"The whole year I was really doubting myself as my marks were always straddling a 2:1 or first.\"\n\"I don't think firsts are just handed out.\n\"Yes, our initial exams were remote and open-book but that was taken into consideration during the marking.\"\nThe HESA figures also suggest that there were around 16,000 students from across the rest of the world studying in Northern Ireland in 2023, around a quarter of all students here.\nPrevious research has suggested that international students are worth nearly \u00a31bn to Northern Ireland's economy.\nThere was a significant rise in top degree grades in the two academic years most affected by the coronavirus pandemic - 2020 and 2021.\nIn 2021, for instance, more than a third of degrees in Northern Ireland (34%) were first-class.\nIn 2023 by contrast, according to HESA, 29% of students in Northern Ireland were awarded first-class degrees - 2,455 students in all.\nUpper second class degrees were awarded to half of students, while about one in five got lower second or third-class degrees.\nThe most popular degree courses were in subjects related to medicine, business and management and social sciences.\nHigher education results trends in Northern Ireland are similar to those across the rest of the UK, which also saw a slight fall in the proportion of first-class degrees awarded in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nIndia sent more students to Northern Ireland - and the UK as a whole - in 2023 than any other overseas country.\nWhile most Northern Ireland students enter higher education in Northern Ireland, about a quarter of Northern Ireland students study elsewhere in the UK.",
    "Blue-green algae has returned to Lough Neagh in high levels.\nLarge green mats have formed around the lough, particularly in the north-east.\nThe blooms previously closed bathing waters in Portstewart and Portrush.\nA \"very sharp uptick\" in the amount of potentially toxic algae has been noticed by scientists monitoring the lough.\nBut what actually is it?\nBlue-green algae, technically known as cyanobacteria, is a collection of microscopic organisms that are naturally present in lakes and streams. \nUnder certain conditions, blue-green algae can become abundant in warm, shallow, undisturbed, nutrient-rich surface waters that receive a lot of sunlight. \nWhen this occurs, blue-green algae can form blooms that discolour the water, or produce floating mats or scums on the water\u2019s surface.\nSo far it has primarily been seen in Lough Neagh and the Lower Bann but other sites have also been impacted, including in recent years north coast bathing waters and the Fermanagh lakes.\nThe incidence of blue green algae is affecting both commercial and recreational fisheries and bathing water users.\nLong-term pollution - largely from agriculture - is a key part of the problem.\nRun-off of fertiliser from surrounding fields over many decades has increased the nutrients in the water, feeding the bacteria's growth.\nAlong with invasive species in the form of water-clearing zebra mussels, the effects of climate change on water temperature in the lough and on our weather help create the perfect conditions for the potentially toxic algae to bloom from the depths where it has always been present.\nDr Matthew Service, from the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI), said blue-green algae spreads rapidly.\n\"It starts to double every seven to 14 days,\" he said.\n\"So once you get to where you can see it, it's just going to keep going until either the climatic conditions change, there's not enough light for it to reproduce or it just simply breaks up with the autumn and winter weather.\"\nAgain this summer, AFBI scientists have detected the algae out in the middle of Lough Neagh, showing the wind is moving the very buoyant species around and causing it to clump together - or aggregate.\nLast year saw the worst bloom of blue-green algae since the mid-1970's.\nThe AFBI said surface temperature readings were higher than usual for the time of year, with 21C detected in 2023.\nThe June average in recent years had been 15C.\nThe AFBI said the conditions could pose a risk to fish and the lough ecosystem.\nThe algal bloom in 2023 was caused by a spell of warm, settled weather coupled with unusual levels of water clarity.\nSome blue-green algae can produce toxins, some do not. \nBut it is not possible to tell if a bloom is toxic simply by looking at it. \nExposure to high levels of any blue-green algae blooms - whether by contact with water blooms, swallowing that water or inhaling airborne droplets - can cause health effects in people and animals.\nThese can include diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, skin, eye or throat irritation; and allergic reactions or breathing difficulties.\nBut the biggest risk is to pets, livestock and wildlife.\nFor them it can be extremely dangerous.\nLast year a number of dog deaths were reported after the animals swam in affected waters.\nDuring a bloom, the water becomes less clear and may look green, blue-green or greenish-brown. \nScums can form during calm weather when several bloom forming species rise to the surface. \nBlooms may last from a few days to several weeks until conditions in the water body change or the weather becomes stormier depriving the algae of light, causing them to die and decompose.\nLough Neagh is the largest body of fresh water in the British Isles.\nThe lough supplies half of Belfast's drinking water and 40% of Northern Ireland's overall.\nThe ownership has been in the Earl of Shaftesbury's estate since the 1800s.\nThe rights to the lough were given a price tag of \u00a36m, 10 years ago, but civil servants at the time advised the government not to go ahead with the sale. It is not known why.\nNicolas Ashley-Cooper, who is the 12th member of his family to hold the title, told BBC News NI in October that a sale was something he was willing to discuss again.\nHowever, he has since said he would like to transfer his estate's ownership of Lough Neagh \"into a charity or community trust model, with rights of nature included\".\nHe added the proposal \u201cmay take time\u201d.\nA two-year National Lottery Heritage-funded project is being led by Lough Neagh Partnership to explore future potential models of management and ownership.\nThe initial consultation closed in June 2024.",
    "At a time when there are more than seven million patients on the NHS waiting list in England and around 100,000 staff vacancies, artificial intelligence could revolutionise the health service by improving patient care and freeing up staff time.\nIts uses are varied - from spotting risk factors in a bid to help prevent chronic conditions such as heart attacks, strokes and diabetes - to assisting clinicians by analysing scans and x-rays to speed up diagnosis.  \nThe technology is also maximising productivity by carrying out routine administrative tasks from automated voice assistants to scheduling appointments and capturing doctors' consultation notes.\nGenerative AI - a type of artificial intelligence that can produce various types of content, including text and images - will be transformative for patient outcomes, according to Sir John Bell, a senior government advisor on life sciences.\nSir John is president of the Ellison Institute of Technology in Oxford - a major new research and development facility investigating global issues, including the use of AI in healthcare.\nHe says generative AI will improve the accuracy of diagnostic scans and generate forecasts of patient outcomes under different medical interventions, leading to more informed, personalised treatment decisions.\nBut he warns researchers should not work in isolation, instead innovation should be shared fairly around the country to avoid some communities missing out.\n\"To achieve these benefits the NHS must unlock the enormous value currently trapped within data silos, to do good while safeguarding against harm,\" Sir John says.\n\"Allowing AI access to all the data, within safe and secure research environments, will improve the representativeness, accuracy and equality of AI tools to benefit all walks of society, reducing the financial and economic burden of running a world-leading National Health Service and leading to a healthier nation.\"\nAI\u00a0opens\u00a0up\u00a0a\u00a0world\u00a0of\u00a0possibilities,\u00a0but\u00a0it\u00a0brings\u00a0risks\u00a0and challenges too, like\u00a0maintaining\u00a0accuracy.\u00a0Results still need to be verified by trained staff.  \nThe government is currently evaluating generative AI for use in the NHS - one issue is that it can sometimes \"hallucinate\" and generate content that is not substantiated.\nDr\u00a0Caroline\u00a0Green,\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Institute\u00a0for\u00a0Ethics\u00a0in\u00a0AI\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0University\u00a0of\u00a0Oxford, is aware of some health and care staff using models like ChatGPT to search for advice.\n\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they understand and know how to mitigate risks from technological limitations... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" she says.\nShe feels it is important to engage people working in health and social care, patients and other organisations early in the development of generative AI and to keep on assessing any impacts with them to build trust.\nDr Green says some patients have decided to deregister from their GPs over the fear of how AI may be used in their healthcare and how their private information may be shared.\n\"This of course means that these individuals may not receive the healthcare they may need in the future and fall through the cracks,\" she says.\nThen there is the risk of bias. AI models may be trained on datasets that might not reflect the populations they will be applied to, exacerbating health inequalities based on things like gender or ethnicity.\nTherefore,\u00a0regulation\u00a0is\u00a0key.\u00a0It needs to keep patients safe and protect their personal data, whilst at the same time increasing capacity to keep up with developments and allow AI to evolve and learn on the job.\nAI-powered medical devices are tightly regulated by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\nThe Health Foundation think tank recently published a six-point national strategy to ensure AI tools are rolled out fairly and regulation is updated.\nNell\u00a0Thornton,\u00a0improvement fellow at the Health Foundation, says: \"There are so many of these models coming through the system that it's difficult to assess them quickly enough.  \n\"That's where we need support around the capacity of the system to regulate these things and we also need some clarity on some of the challenges that will come from the quirkiness of generative AI systems and what additional regulation they might need.\"\nDr Paul Campbell, MHRA Head of Software and AI, says: \"As a regulator, we must balance appropriate oversight to protect patient safety with the agility needed to respond to the particular challenges presented by these products to ensure we continue to be an enabler for innovation.\u201d \nThe Department of Health and Social Care says the new Labour government will \"harness the power of AI\" by purchasing new AI-enabled scanners to diagnose patients earlier and treat them faster.\nWhile few can deny the transformative effect AI is having within healthcare, there are challenges to overcome, not least that NHS staff need the confidence to use it and patients must be able to tr",
    "Asda is going to put more staff on checkouts after admitting it has reached a limit with self-service tills.\nThe supermarket said while self-checkouts work well for customers, it wants to invest additional hours into having manned checkouts.\nIt claimed that the decision was not about shoppers' preference for a human to help them rather than a machine.\nBut other retailers, such as northern supermarket chain Booths, have axed almost all self-service tills. \nIt said when it took the decision late last year that \"we believe colleagues serving customers delivers a better customer experience\". \nSupermarket shoppers have previously told the BBC about their issues with self-service tills.\n\"I am severely sight impaired - registered blind - so, self service tills are a non-starter,\" Pennie Orger said. \"My guide dog is clever, but not that clever.\"\nThe tills can also be an issue for deaf shoppers who can't rely on the self-checkouts verbal instructions.\nMichael Gleeson, Asda\u2019s chief financial officer, said that a threshold had been reached in terms of how many self-checkouts it feels works well.\n\u201cI think we have reached a level of self-checkouts and scan and go where we feel that works best for our customers, and we feel we\u2019ve got the balance just about right.\n\u201cWe have invested additional hours in manned checkouts and that\u2019s been within the existing physical infrastructure [of the stores],\" he said.\nHe added that the move was not about more checkouts but about \"more colleagues on checkouts\".\nStaff will be added to tills over the rest of the year, said Asda, adding that an increased staff presence was not related to shoplifting.\nLast year, shoplifting in England and Wales hit the highest level for 20 years.  \nShoplifting offences recorded by police reached 430,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. \nThe origin of the self-service checkout began with the invention of the automated teller machine in 1967.\nA few decades later, the self-service till was invented by David Humble who had been inspired by standing in a long grocery checkout line in south Florida in 1984.\nThe tills became popular in the 1990s and by 2013, there were more than 200,000 in stores around the world. Numbers hit 325,000 by 2021.\nIn UK supermarkets alone, there are about 80,000 self-service tills, according to data from RBR Data Services, up from 53,000 five years ago.",
    "A memorial service has been held in Jersey to mark the 80th anniversary of the sinking of a US naval vessel sunk off the island's south coast. \nHistorian Alexander Ferne said 16 lives were lost during the \"fierce battle\" that took place just off the Noirmont Point on 9 August 1944.\nA service to remember the lives lost was held at Noirmont Point at 11:00 BST where wreathes were laid. \nHe said the battle was not well-known, which had inspired him to conduct research because of the \"strong island connection\".\nMr Ferne said: \"The fierce naval battle  took place just off Jersey\u2019s south coast, with the US Navy PT Boat Squadron, RON 34, intercepting a German convoy in the early morning, firstly at La Corbi\u00e8re and then along the coast to Noirmont point.\n\"The battle saw PT509 - the Sassy Sue - sunk, PTs 503 and 507 damaged and 16 US Naval personnel lost their lives. \n\"There were 15 men on board [PT509], 14 of them were killed and there was a sole survivor who after the liberation of the island was able to tell the detailed story of what happened.\"\nHe said after PT509 was lost, two other boats attempted to find it and during the search two other men were killed just outside St Helier harbour.\nMr Ferne explained how he had been in contact with the families of the men who have helped \"put parts of the jigsaw together\". \nAt the memorial, he said wreathes were laid on behalf of the families who had lost loved ones.

    "A handbag made from alligator skin and tiny vials of perfume that still release a potent scent are just some of the precious artefacts recovered from the world\u2019s most famous shipwreck - the Titanic.\nThe exact location of the warehouse where they are stored is a closely guarded secret, because of the value of its contents. All we can say is that it is somewhere in Atlanta, Georgia, in the United States.\nInside, the shelves are packed with thousands of items: from an upturned bathtub and dented porthole, to intricately etched glassware and tiny buttons.\nThe BBC was given a rare chance to look around the storage facility and discover the stories behind some of these objects.\n\u201cIt's a really beautiful, fashionable little bag,\u201d says Tomasina Ray, director of collections for RMS Titanic Inc, the company that has recovered these artefacts. The US firm has the salvage rights to the ship and over the years has retrieved 5,500 items from the wreck site, a selection of which are put on display around the world.\nThe bag is made from alligator skin, which has survived decades in the depths of the North Atlantic. The delicate items inside have been preserved too, revealing details of the life of its owner - a third-class passenger called Marian Meanwell.\n\u201cShe was a 63-year-old milliner,\u201d says Tomasina. \u201cAnd she was travelling to the US to be with her daughter who was recently widowed.\u201d\nAmong the mementos inside was a faded photograph, thought to be Marian Meanwell\u2019s mother.\nThere was also paperwork she would need for her new life in America, including a handwritten reference letter from her former landlord in London. It states: \u201cWe have always found Miss Meanwell to be a good tenant, prompt with payment.\u201d\nHer medical inspection card was inside too, as all third-class passengers needed to prove they weren\u2019t bringing disease into the US. But this water-stained document reveals a tragic twist of fate.\nMarian Meanwell was booked on the Majestic - another White Star Line ship. But it didn\u2019t sail, so on the card, Majestic is crossed out and her passage shows that she was transferred to the Titanic and became one of 1,500 people to lose their lives.\n\u201cBeing able to tell her story and have these objects is really important,\u201d says Tomasina.\n\u201cOtherwise she\u2019s just another name on the list.\u201d\nItems that belonged to survivors have also been brought back from the deep.\nTomasina opens a plastic container and a sickly-sweet smell fills the air. \u201cIt\u2019s very potent,\u201d she admits.\nInside are tiny vials of perfume. They are sealed, but their strong aroma escapes, even after decades on the seafloor.\n\u201cThere was a perfume salesman on board and he had over 90 of these little perfume vials,\u201d Tomasina explains.\nHis name was Adolphe Saalfeld and he had been travelling as a first-class passenger.\nSaalfeld was one of the 700 people who survived. But with women and children prioritised during the evacuation, some men who made it off the ship were left troubled.\n\u201cHe had passed by the time we found this,\u201d says Tomasina. \u201cBut it's my understanding that he did live with a bit of guilt - survivor's guilt.\u201d\nAlso in the collection is a champagne bottle - complete with champagne inside and a cork in the top.\n\u201cA little bit of water probably would have gotten in through the cork as it compressed and equalised the pressure. And then it just sat on the bottom of the ocean,\u201d says Tomasina.\nWhen the Titanic sank in 1912, after striking an iceberg, the ship split apart and its contents spilled out, creating a vast debris field.\n\u201cThere are a lot of bottles on the ocean floor and a lot of stock pots and kitchen pots too, because Titanic actually broke up around one of the kitchens,\u201d says Tomasina.\nThere were thousands of bottles of champagne on board. The liner\u2019s owner wanted its first-class passengers to experience the ultimate in opulence, with sumptuous surroundings and the finest food and drink.\n\u201cIt was like a floating palace and Titanic was supposed to be the most luxurious liner,\u201d says Tomasina.\n\u201cSo having champagne, having a gym, having all these amenities and these great things for the passengers would have been really important to them.\u201d\nThe Titanic was on her maiden voyage, travelling from Southampton to the US, when she hit the iceberg.\nThe ship had advanced safety features for the time and was famously said to be unsinkable.\nTomasina shows us some of the ship\u2019s rivets, chunky metal pins that held its thick steel plates together. There would have been more than three million of them.\n\u201cWhen Titanic sank, there was a theory that they were using substandard materials perhaps, and that's what caused it to sink faster,\u201d Tomasina explains.\nSome of these rivets have been tested to see if they contain any impurities.\n\u201cThere were high concentrations of slag in these, which is a glass-like material that makes them maybe a little bit more brittle in the cold,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIf these rivets were brittle, and one of the rivet heads popped off more easily, then it could have al",
    "The number of recorded violent crimes against women and girls on the transport network has risen in the past year by 20%, the British Transport Police Authority has said. \nMore than 11,000 complaints were made in the year to March - compared with 9,464 the previous year. \nPolice say the sharp rise is likely to be down to more people reporting what has happened to them, rather than more crimes being committed.\nTransport Secretary Louise Haigh said the figures were \"appalling\" and the government would \"relentlessly\" hold publicly-owned railways to account. \nFigures published by the authority overseeing the transport police show an average of 31 violent crimes a day against women and girls were reported. \nCharity Refuge, which works with survivors of domestic abuse, said the figures were likely to be the tip of the iceberg.\nA spokeswoman said: \u201cMany women and girls are not able to report crimes committed against them because of the many barriers preventing them from doing so such as fear of not being believed or repercussions from their abuser, and a lack of faith in the system.\u201d\nThe End Violence Against Women Coalition, a campaign group, said the figures were likely to be a result of more women being willing to report crimes, rather than sexual offences increasing in number.\nExecutive Director Andrea Simon said: \u201cFor most women and girls, we have experienced incidents of sexual harassment and other types of non-contact sexual offending on the transport network for a very long time. \n\"It isn\u2019t new to many women and girls. We also know perpetrators can target busy transport network times.\u201d\nShe called for police to take action to deal with the complaints.\nBritish Transport Police (BTP) cover the railways of England, Wales and Scotland as well as the London Underground, Docklands Light Railway, the Midland Metro tram system, Croydon Tramlink, Tyne and Wear Metro, Glasgow Subway and IFS cloud cable car.\nThe figures, published in the annual report of the British Transport Police Authority show 11,357 violent crimes against women and girls were recorded in the year to 31 March 2024. That was up a fifth from the total for the year before, 9,464.\nIn 2021/22, when passenger numbers were lower due to Covid, the figure stood at 7,561.\nPassenger numbers have been recovering since the pandemic. The Office of Rail and Road says rail passenger numbers rose by 16% between 2022/23 and 2023/24.\nThe British Transport Police Authority's report also says the number of crimes involving sexual harassment in the past year was 1,908, which was a small decrease on the previous year (2,040).\nThe number of sexual offences being recorded increased, from 2,246 last year to 2,475 in the year to March.\nBTP say sexual offences include rape, indecent exposure and upskirting. \nSexual harassment, transport police say, covers \"behaviour of a sexual nature which violates your dignity; makes you feel intimidated, degraded or humiliated; and creates a hostile or offensive environment\". \nIt can include intrusive staring or persistent questioning, BTP add.   \nIn May, BTP also revealed that reported sexual offences against and sexual harassment of young women and girls had jumped by a third on London\u2019s transport network.\nIt suggested most offences took place during the evening rush hour, on busy trains.\nSafeguarding minister Jess Phillips said:  \"Whether these figures reflect an increase in reporting, an increase in the volume of crime, or a combination of the two, one thing is clear: The level of violence, harassment and sexual offences that women and girls are facing when using the transport network is completely unacceptable, and can not be allowed to go unchallenged.\nAsked what should be done to improve the situation, Ms Phillips said the government needed to make sure the justice system was \"fit completely for purpose to tackle the most serious offenders of these crimes\". \nShe also said people needed to be given \"confidence to come forward\" and make sure \"action is taken\". \nAsked if she would be in favour of women-only carriages, she said: \"The day that I ask women to be changing their behaviour to ensure they are not assaulted is the day you can take to the airways and say I had failed.\"\nBTP have said tackling violence against women and girls is a priority.\nA new app for reporting allegations \u2013 Railway Guardian \u2013 has been downloaded more than 146,000 times.\nHead of Crime and Public Protection Detective Chief Superintendent Sarah White said: \"We know that these crimes commonly go under-reported, that is why we continue to relentlessly campaign to encourage victims and witnesses to report to us - and with this we expect the number of reports to continue to increase.\"",

    "Imagining Roman Britain conjures up images of emperors, gladiators, posh villas -  and the army that held the empire together.\nBut a much more varied story is emerging, thanks to evidence uncovered by excavations in recent years. \nBeer brewing was just one of the industries that grew rapidly to supply the military, and small towns and cities like Camulodunum (Colchester) and Verulamium (St Albans) in the three-and-a-half centuries of Roman rule. \nSo, what have these digs revealed about daily life in Roman Britain?\nIt took the Romans about 45 years to take over most of England and Wales after they invaded in AD 43, arriving in a disunited land dominated by tribal leaders. \nThe need to supply their army was the \"key driver\", according to archaeologist Edward Biddulph, as well as the urban centres they created. This led to the rapid industrial development.\nThe Oxford Archaeology senior project manager said pottery, building materials, metalwork and glass were all being produced across the country, but from the 3rd and 4th Centuries \"we start to see mega industries\".\n\"We know industrial activity was undertaken at a very large scale at a number of sites in Roman Britain and we have some very large sites that are helping us to really fill in the gaps in our knowledge, the missing pieces that we've long been struggling with,\" he said. \n\"One of the classic areas is malting and brewing, if you look at Roman Britain you see next to nothing about this, yet people must have been drinking beer.\"\n\nEvidence of brewing on an industrial level was discovered at a Roman villa at North Fleet in Kent, and using the features found there - such as malting ovens and lined tanks for steeping the grain - archaeologists knew what to look for at smaller sites.\nOne of those was Berryfields, a development near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, excavated between 2007 and 2016.\n\"Oven-like structures\" often found at Roman settlements had previously been believed to be used for drying corn. \nMr Biddulph said now they are \"recognised as malting ovens, used to heat partially germinated grain to produce malt\".\n\"At Berryfields, we found evidence of malting and brewing and the tanks used to steep the grain before processing,\" he said. \n\"We tend to think of the Roman world as being very much a wine-loving place.\n\"But actually a lot of the population in Roman Britain were drinking beer and we see that in the pottery they were using, large beakers in the same sort of sizes as modern pint glasses.\"\nAnother industry that began producing on an industrial scale was discovered at Stanford Wharf Nature Reserve, near Thurrock in Essex, in 2009.\nThe excavation revealed salt had been extracted there from the Iron Age, but that really ramped up in the 3rd and 4th centuries. \nMr Biddulph said: \"Salt was one of the most important commodities in the Roman world, not only used for flavour and to preserve food but in religious activity and for cleansing.\n\"In fact the Roman author Pliny the Elder said 'Civilised life can't proceed without salt'.\"\nWith its location on the Thames estuary, the salt was probably exported to London, but also across the rest of the country and abroad. The county still hosts the industry, as the home of Maldon Sea Salt. \n\"And actually, more excitingly there was evidence that they made a fermented fish sauce, and fish sauce was like the Roman tomato sauce, that they used on absolutely everything,\" Mr Biddulph said.\nFor centuries, the sauce had been imported from Spain, but after that industry collapsed it looks like the Essex manufacturer stepped into the gap.\nThe 3rd Century onwards saw the establishment of large \"villa estates\", said Mr Biddulph.\nThe driver for that seems to have been the need to feed the Roman army, especially the soldiers stationed along the River Rhine in present-day Germany.  \nThese estates also had their industrial areas, as an excavation near Corby, Northamptonshire, revealed in 2020.\nEvidence of pottery, ceramic building material such as roof tiles and bricks and lime, were unearthed but \"a tile kiln was an exceptional discovery\". \nHe said: \"One of the features was a nice, really well-made engineered army-built road.\n\"There was no Roman fort there, but it just shows how connected these villa owners were to the elite and having their own army-built road really shows this.\"\nAnd in a glimpse of its long-dead inhabitants, the imprint of a woman's sandal and animal footprints were found on some of the tile rejects, while another tile had a finger-made inscription.\nGoods like olive oil and wine were imported to Britain using large ceramic jars known as amphora, but Romano-Britons \"produced their own big jars which could rival this pottery\", said Mr Biddulph.\nA 2021 excavation at Horningsea, next to the River Cam in Cambridgeshire, revealed it was a major pottery production area.\nMr Biddulph said: \"Its most distinctive aspect was the production of very large jars. \n\"These may have been a specialist line, but it is unclear whe",
    "An MP who lives at home with his parents has called for new housing developments.\nBen Goldsborough, the Labour MP for South Norfolk, said he wanted to see more homes built across his constituency after he moved into his parents' home in Snetterton.\nHis call follows opposition against plans for new houses in towns and villages in the area.\nMr Goldsborough, 33, said he believed people would not be encouraged \"to get on the property ladder\" without new homes.\n\"I\u2019m pro more housing and think we need to encourage people to get on the property ladder \u2013 we\u2019re taking away that aspiration if we don\u2019t build more homes,\" he explained.\nRecent plans for new housing in places such as Loddon and Bracon Ash have drawn opposition from locals\u00a0who said schools and GP surgeries were already stretched to their limits.\nThe Labour government intends to\u00a0increase the rate of housebuilding and remove barriers in the planning system to allow large-scale developments to go ahead.\nMr Goldsborough, who is originally from Suffolk, recently finished a spell as mayor of Flint, in north Wales, where he was a member of the town council, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nHe has lately called on the government to reform planning laws due to people living in Hethersett, Mulbarton and Loddon being \"burned\" by housing without the infrastructure to meet the needs of the community.\n\"The system is so backwards and a lot of unscrupulous developers get a huge opportunity with these rules,\" he added.\n\"We need to flip the system \u2013 not stop building quality housing.\"\nMr Goldsborough said he hoped to find his own home in south Norfolk soon \u2013 but had prioritised finding a constituency office first.\nThe average age of a first-time home buyer in the UK is 33, which happens to be the same age as Mr Goldsborough. So the Labour MP is well placed to understand the need for new housing.\nHis party has just made housebuilding one of its main priorities in government, with a goal to deliver 1.5 million new homes over the next five years.\nAs part of that aim local councils will be given mandatory housebuilding targets, which has not gone down well in Norfolk. Campaign groups have raised concerns over plans for more than 49,000 new homes in the Norwich area over the next 15 years. \nMr Goldsborough has correctly identified the need among young people for more affordable housing. Yet he would also know that there were many voters who were worried about the expansion of their communities and the impact on local services and the countryside.\nHow to balance those opposing views will be one of the big issues in Norfolk, and particularly Mr Goldborough\u2019s South Norfolk constituency, over the next few years.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Businesses in Hull that were affected by widespread violence and riots on Saturday have continued with a clean-up operation.\nShops were looted, fires were started, cars were damaged and police officers were attacked following demonstrations involving anti-immigration protesters.\nCorey Hunter-Mitchell, who works at Three on King Edward Street, said: \"If you want to get a point across there are ways to do that. But smashing up a city and causing violence isn't the way to do it.\"\nTo date, Humberside Police have made 29 arrests and investigations to identify others involved continue.\nMr Hunter-Mitchell said the disorder \"seemed to flip out of nowhere\" and quickly became \"violent and aggressive\".\n\"It was disgusting and horrible. There were a lot of people and young people here and to escalate to the point it did was unnecessary,\" he said.\n\"I don't think some of them even know why they're angry. Some do and some are voicing opinions but others have no clue what they're standing up for.\"\nThe Specsavers opticians on Jameson Street saw its windows smashed by looters, who also targeted a nearby Greggs and an O2 shop.\nDavid Proudfoot, a director at the business, said: \"The first priority was the safety of our customers and we now need to make sure we look after them.\n\"The staff were anxious but they've all been back in today. We have a diverse team who have come from all over the world but they're feeling confident about getting back to business.\n\"It's a small minority that have caused a lot of damage which is unfortunate, but we'll deal with it.\"\nKathryn Shillito, executive director of Hull BID, a group which promotes the city centre, had met staff at Shoezone, which was looted and smashed up.\nShe said: \"It's devastating. There has been a lot of damage but the team are keen to get back up and running.\n\"It's disgraceful. These are ordinary people trying to earn a living. If people think they have a right to steal then they are damaging the people that work there, the business and the reputation of the city.\n\"We're a welcoming city. We get people coming in and they love it. I hope the full force of the law is after those responsible.\"\nFurther down the street, Stuart Sheriff, the manager of Blacks, said he and his staff had been fortunate compared with their neighbours.\n\"We were lucky. We were open on Saturday but we closed early because it was absolute chaos,\" he said.\n\"It escalated and people came just to trash the city. It was definitely criminal thuggery.

    "The compensation that egg donors receive will rise for the first time in over a decade, but people should not donate purely for the money, the UK fertility regulator has warned.\nIt is illegal to pay someone for their eggs in the UK but compensation is paid to cover expenses. This will rise from \u00a3750 to \u00a3986 on 1 October, partly to reflect price rises.\nThe UK currently has a shortage of egg donors, particularly from black and ethnic minority backgrounds, the regulator said.\nYasmin Sharman, from London, was inspired to donate for the first time aged 18. \"I realised there was a lack of people of colour donors and that upset me... and so that made me want to do it again,\" they said.\n\"I identify as a non-binary lesbian so I already had the thought in my head of I may have to go through different routes to have children,\" they explained.\nNow aged 26, Mx Sharman has donated three times and shares their egg donation journey on TikTok. They said a lot of the comments focused on the compensation not being considered enough.\n\"If you raise it too much there is a risk there that people will do it solely for the money, which puts lower income people more at risk,\" they said.\nThe compensation will rise for the first time since 2011 in England Wales and NI partly due to inflation, said the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).\nEgg donor compensation is not paid in Scotland.\n\"It's going up to just under \u00a31,000 which the HFEA felt was a right balance between compensating people for their time but really recognising that, in the UK, egg donation is an altruistic act,\" said Clare Ettinghausen, director of strategy and corporate affairs at the HFEA.\nDonating purely for the money should come with a \"clear health warning\" as there are some dangers, added Ms Ettinghausen.\n\"It's not without risks. You go through the first part of IVF treatment. It can be uncomfortable,\" she added.\nDonors are also made aware that any children born from their eggs can try to contact them once they turn 18.\nCharlotte Holmes, 35, who lives in London, also shares her egg donor experience on social media.\nShe is currently undergoing the donation process for a second time for a couple who contacted her online.\n\"I give blood. I've donated my hair. It's something for me that feels in excess especially when I don't want children,\" Ms Holmes said.\n\"The first time I donated was last year. I donated to the London Egg Bank and this year after a couple reached out to me on Instagram, I'm donating to them.\"\nMs Holmes told the BBC she will not receive any extra money from the couple - only the current \u00a3750 compensation from the clinic.\nAccording to data from the HFEA, egg donation has remained largely the same since the 2011 compensation rise but demand for eggs has increased.\nMs Holmes doesn't think people should donate purely for financial purposes but hopes the increase in compensation can help address the current donor shortage.\n\"Does the additional \u00a3250 make a huge amount of difference? Probably not,\" she said.\n\"If it opens the door to other women going 'oh \u00a31,000', is that a good thing? I think it is because we're desperate for egg donors,\" she added.\nThis is a sentiment shared by Belle Brittle, 24, from Cambridgeshire, who donated her eggs last year.\n\"It may entice people to donate their eggs, albeit for financial reasons, but if it works to encourage people to at least think about donating, then it\u2019s important,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s an egg donation process, not an egg sales market.\"\nSome clinics hope the compensation rise will help to tackle the egg donor shortage.\n\u201cIncreasing the compensation for egg donors in the UK to \u00a3986 is justified as it better reflects the time, effort, and medical risks involved in the donation and helps address the current donor shortage,\" said Dr Thanos Papathanasiou, chief executive and medical director at Bourn Hall fertility clinic.\n\"The donation process still requires genuine personal commitment, so increasing the compensation would not undermine the altruistic motivations behind egg donation but provide recognition of the donor\u2019s good will.\"\nAll egg donors are offered counselling by clinics and have to go through several medical tests before they can donate.\nIn most cases you need to be over 18 and under 36 to donate.\nApproved donors can go through up to 10 rounds of donations but more than 10 children could be born from the donations if several eggs are used by the same family.\n\"Really understand that it's not something you do quickly and then it's over,\" Yasmin  Sharman said.\n\"In 18 years, there is the possibility of a human being reaching out and contacting you.\"",
    "The fatal stabbing of three young girls at a dance class in the seaside town of Southport, in the north of England, has been followed by the worst unrest the UK has seen in more than a decade.\nThe violence, in towns and cities across England and in Northern Ireland, has been fuelled by misinformation online, the far-right and anti-immigration sentiment.\nCommunities have responded with a series of rallies against the riots, with thousands gathering on Wednesday 7 August.\nOn 29 July, Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga event. Eight more children and two adults were injured. \nLater that day, police said they had arrested a 17-year-old from a village nearby and that they were not treating the incident as terror-related. \nAlmost immediately after the attack, social media posts falsely speculated that the suspect was an asylum seeker who arrived in the UK on a boat in 2023, with an incorrect name being widely circulated. There were also unfounded rumours that he was Muslim.\nIn fact, as the BBC and other media outlets reported, the suspect was born in Wales to Rwandan parents.\nPolice urged the public not to spread \"unconfirmed speculation and false information\".\nThe following evening, more than a thousand people attended a vigil for the victims in Southport. Later on, violence broke out near a local mosque. People threw bricks, bottles and other missiles at the mosque and police, a police van was set alight and 27 officers were taken to hospital.\nThe disorder was widely condemned. Local MP Patrick Hurley said \"thugs\" had travelled to the town to use the deaths of three children \"for their own political purposes\", while Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer denounced the \u201cmarauding mobs on the streets of Southport\u201d.\nThere had been discussion of the rally on regional anti-immigration channels on the Telegram messaging app. Police said the violence was believed to have involved supporters of the now disbanded far-right group the English Defence League (EDL).\nThe day after the Southport riot, violent protests in London, Hartlepool and Manchester broke out, which police linked to Southport. More took place throughout the week - with many targeting mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers.\nWhile there was no single organising force at work, BBC analysis of activity on mainstream social media and in smaller public groups shows a clear pattern of influencers driving a message for people to gather for protests. \nMultiple influencers within different circles amplified false claims about the identity of the attacker, reaching a large audience - including ordinary people without any connection to far-right individuals and groups.\nOn X, EDL founder, far-right activist and convicted criminal Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, posted inflammatory messages to his nearly a million followers while on holiday in Cyprus.\nAn influencer on X associated with Yaxley-Lennon, who posts under \u201cLord Simon\u201d, was among the first to publicly call for nationwide protests.\nAfter the Southport attack, riots broke out across England, from Plymouth on the south coast to Sunderland in the North East. There have also been riots in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\nCrowds attacked mosques and accommodation housing asylum seekers, cars and buildings, including a library, were set on fire, and shops looted.\nViolence in south Belfast, where anti-immigration and anti-racism protesters faced off in tense scenes outside the city hall, involved \u201cracist elements\u201d, a judge has said. Police are investigating an assault on a man whose head was reportedly stamped on as a racially motivated hate crime.\nIn Rotherham on Sunday, terrified staff at the Holiday Inn, which was housing asylum seekers, described how they stacked fridges and other furniture against a door to barricade themselves against a mob which had smashed its way into the building. Nearby residents described fleeing their homes as rioters entered their gardens.\nAs of Thursday 8 August, the chair of the Police Federation Tiffany Lynch estimated more than 100 police officers had been injured in the disorder, some receiving hospital treatment.\nMerseyside Police's chief constable said some of the officers injured \"feared they would not make it home\" to their families.\nThe spate of violence has prompted concern from outside of the UK. Malaysia, Nigeria, Australia and India have all issued travel advisories, urging people to stay vigilant and avoid protests.\nIt is a \"nuanced picture\" with a degree of local coordination, but also many instances of \"locals reacting to what they're seeing on social media, what they're seeing outside in their streets and just joining in\", a police source told PA news agency.\nBBC Home Affairs Editor Mark Easton was in Sunderland on Friday night, where he said far-right rioters attacked police, set fire to an advice centre next door to a police station, threw s",
    "Dozens of families said they have become \"trapped\" with no way of getting their children to school after a bus service they had relied on for years was axed.\nSuffolk County Council has confirmed its DM317 route from Coddenham to Debenham High School will not be in operation from September.\nPupils who had their travel funded by the council would be put on alternative routes, but more than 20 students, whose transport was paid for by their parents as part of the spare seat scheme, will not be.\nSuffolk County Council said it had to \"prioritise its finite resources and budget to ensure we meet our statutory obligation in the provision of school travel\". \nKate Haley, who lives in Little Stonham, Suffolk, has paid \u00a3360 a term for the last three years so her eldest daughter could go to and from school on the bus.\nShe only found out the service had ended after applying for a seat for her youngest daughter, who is starting at Debenham High School in September.\n\u201cWe are feeling a bit hard done by because we are all working parents but we are no longer able to get our children to the school they are entitled to go to,\u201d the 47-year-old said.\n\u201cWe have started to look at alternatives as a group of parents but a minibus will cost \u00a328,000 for the year which is just not doable \u2013 that\u2019s a full-time job.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do long-term - it\u2019s incredibly stressful and not something we want to be worrying about. We are being penalised for being working parents.\u201d\nVale Brittain, 50, from Creeting St Mary, Suffolk, is another parent whose two sons have utilised the service for several years.\nShe added: \u201cWorking parents rely on this bus and we pay a small fortune every term, but we are willing to pay that because we need this service.\n\u201cYet they have just withdrawn it absolutely last minute, out of the blue, and they have just advised parents to carshare \u2013 so, \u2018sort yourself out\u2019 in other words.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any other public service coming from the village, so we are literally trapped. I feel we are being neglected and let down.\u201d\nMum-of-two Liza Ellen, 51, from Bedfield, Suffolk, previously experienced a similar situation when the spare seat scheme on a school bus service in her area was dropped.\nAfter new regulations were introduced in 2020, any vehicles that could not cater to those with disabilities were no longer permitted to take onboard paying students.\n\u201cEvery single day the bus stops just 200 yards from our front door with just two students on it but my children are not allowed to get on it,\u201d Liza said.\n\u201cTaking away a bus service and leaving people completely in the lurch and penalising them for being a working family is very short-sighted and morally unjust.\n\u201cSuffolk County Council is trying to save money and will do everything in its power to save money \u2013 but they are not looking at the bigger picture.\u201d\nAcross the county, 140 applications for spare seats for the new academic year have been refused so far, according to Suffolk County Council.\nA spokesperson for Suffolk County Council, said there was a limit to the number of spaces it could offer and a seat would \"always\" be available to those who are eligible.  \n\"Suffolk County Council must prioritise its finite resources and budget to ensure we meet our statutory obligation in the provision of school travel, ensuring that taxpayers\u2019 money is used efficiently,\" a spokesperson for the authority said. \n\"Parents with children who are eligible for county council-funded school travel take priority. Where there are spare seats available on buses, these will be offered up to others on a first come first served basis. \n\"The offer of a spare seat comes with the guidance that it is not guaranteed and could change or be removed at any time.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Toxic algorithms, far-right alliances across sectarian divides and old-fashioned race hate with an \u201celement\u201d of paramilitarism.\nThese are just some of the issues that converged in a week that saw racist violence hit the streets of Belfast.\nMuslim businesses were burnt down, a man\u2019s head was stamped on, and houses were targeted in racially-motivated attacks.\nBBC News NI has asked the question: Who is behind it all?\nIt is a difficult question to answer because the reality is: No one truly knows.\nBut a good place to start is to ask how did we get here?\nIt was the murder of three children in Southport that led to riots in towns and cities across England.\nThis triggered the anti-immigration protest at Belfast City Hall last Saturday, which descended into a day and night of violence, before further disorder followed.\nBut in reality, race hate has been rising in Northern Ireland over recent months and years.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is an escalation but in reality a continuum of a long-term issue of racist intimidation and racist violence, largely driven by elements of loyalist paramilitarism,\u201d said Daniel Holder, director of the Committee on the Administration of Justice.\n\u201cAnd one of the issues is, because there has been a high level of impunity for that activity, that has potentially emboldened those to go on and do this even more out in the open, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen this week.\u201d\nThe PSNI said it was in no doubt that a paramilitary \u201celement\u201d was involved in the disorder. But loyalist sources insist none of it has been orchestrated at organisational level.\n\u201cI mean, loyalism is not a monolith there are those who do wish to move on,\u201d said Daniel Holder.\n\u201cWe really need armed groups to go away completely but there are certainly elements of loyalist paramilitary groups engaged in racist violence and intimidation.\u201d\nWhether the leadership of those groups have moved to discourage those engaging in violence remains to be seen.\nOne loyalist source likened the recent flare-up of trouble in south Belfast to \u201ca bag of marbles, it's hard to know what will happen next\".\nThere is an argument that those engaged in disorder are frustrated by a lack of social housing, but at the same time, there\u2019s been an element of recreational rioting at play.\nThe claim that young people have been spurred onto the streets by older people with links to paramilitaries is something the police are investigating.\u00a0\nBut it is also argued that those rioting have been fuelled by disinformation fed online through social media pages and groups managed by anonymous actors.\nOne man was arrested on suspicion of publishing written material intended to stir up hatred.\nPosts on one such page included encouragement to attend planned anti-immigration protests \u2013 but those behind the page insist they are not the organisers of the events.\nOne post stated the protests \"should remain peaceful/respectful at all times\".\nOn the other hand, other posts appear to try to whip up anger and resentment towards ethnic minorities.\nThe page also posted about an unlikely cross-border alliance that emerged at last Saturday\u2019s protest and that saw union flags and tricolours carried side-by-side.\nProtesters carrying a \u201cCoolock Says No\u201d banner marched through the streets. \nIt is believed those carrying it were associated with the movement in Dublin which is opposed to asylum seekers moving into a site in the north of the city.\nOne of the men, who travelled from Dublin with the group, posted a video on social media, which appears to have since been deleted, saying \u201chistory [was] being made\u201d with loyalist and nationalists marching together.\nIn another, he said: \u201cWhen you be seeing tricolours and union jacks marching side-by-side with a common goal, walking together as opposed to tearing lumps out of each other?\u201d\nMark Malone, from the civil society organisation Hope for Courage Collective, suggested that, in some cases, this solidarity might be an example of alliances being formed by the far-right.\n\u201cThere have always been attempts by very small numbers of people to try to make alliances across traditional sectarian divides, on the basis of white supremacy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHowever, in the context of the north itself, those alliances have never really lasted or gone anywhere.\u201d\nHe said when talking about relatively small numbers of protesters, the effects online can still be large.\n\u201cPart of the issue is the sort of amplification of even small numbers on social media that can give the appearance of broad swell of support rather than an actual reflection of the particular numbers of the people who are involved in the act of organising itself,\u201d he said.\nWhen it comes to the spreading of misinformation, social media platforms do have incentives in place to try and crack down, but obviously this is a big job.\nWhile liking a page or following a particular account on social media is the user\u2019s choice, there are concerns that extreme content is being \u201cpushed\u201d on people by the companies behind the platforms ",
    "Two critically-endangered monkeys have been born at Chester Zoo.\nThe Cheshire zoo said the twin cotton-top tamarin monkeys were born to parents  Leo and Treat, following a five-month pregnancy.\nWeighing 40g at birth and measuring 10cm (3.9in) from their heads to the tips of their tails, they were said to be about the size of golf balls.  \nMike Jordan, animal and plant director at the zoo, said their arrival is \"really important\" for the species as they are \"exceptionally rare\". \nCalled cotton-top tamarins due to the striking mane of white fur that runs from the forehead to shoulders and resembles a fluffy cotton ball, the monkeys are instantly recognisable for their unique appearance, zoo conservationists said. \nMr Jordan said: \"Mum and dad have been sharing parental duties and as a result the little ones are both thriving. \n\"It\u2019s still early days, so the babies are too tiny for us to confidently determine if each of them is male or female but, in a few months\u2019 time, we\u2019ll know for sure when they grow in confidence and start to branch out and explore the treetops on their own.\"\nCotton-top tamarins use a system of facial expressions and more than 38 different vocalisations to call their young, defend their territory, and warn the family group of predators.\nChester Zoo is part of a Europe-wide plan to prevent the species from disappearing altogether due to a major decline caused by them being captured and sold as pets. \nIn their native Colombia, only 5% of their original habitat remains intact due to mass logging for the agriculture, paper and timber industries.\nAs a result, the species is listed as critically endangered on the International Union of Conservation and Nature\u2019s (IUCN) Red List of the world\u2019s most threatened species.\nIt is estimated that just 2,000 remain in the wild, making them one of the rarest primate species on earth, Chester Zoo said. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Alex Murdaugh, the disgraced lawyer convicted of murdering his wife and son, may get a new murder trial after South Carolina\u2019s highest court agreed to hear his appeal over a claim of jury tampering.\nA jury found Murdaugh guilty of both murders after a six-week long trial in March 2023, and was sentenced to life in prison.\nHis lawyers have since argued that a court clerk tampered with the jury, telling them not to trust Murdaugh\u2019s testimony and to speed up the verdict.\nThey also accused the clerk, Becky Hill, of using the case and the guilty verdict to promote herself and a book she wrote about the trial. She has denied any wrongdoing.\nMs Hill, who read the guilty verdict out loud at Murdaugh\u2019s trial, separately faces 76 counts of misconduct accusing her of improperly seeking financial gain and will appear before the State Ethics Commission in December. \nIn their filing to the South Carolina Supreme Court, Murdaugh\u2019s lawyers argued that \u201cthere is an irrebuttable presumption of prejudice when a state official secretly advocates a guilty verdict\u201d.\nThey also asked the state\u2019s highest court to certify the case ahead of an appeal, arguing that it was an issue of significant legal and public interest.\nWednesday\u2019s decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court to consider a retrial is the latest chapter in Murdaugh\u2019s legal saga.\nOnce a powerful South Carolina lawyer, the 56-year-old and his legal troubles have since captivated a global audience and inspired documentaries, podcasts and book deals. The trial itself was also televised.\nHis wife, Maggie, and son Paul were shot at close range near the dog kennels on their family estate on 7 June 2021.\nDuring his trial, the jury heard that for years, Murdaugh had been stealing from his law partners and clients to feed an addiction to painkillers and an extravagant lifestyle.\nThey argued that he killed his wife and son in an attempt to conceal years of financial corruption. Murdaugh had pleaded not guilty in the case.\nIn April, Murdaugh was sentenced to 40 years in prison at a separate trial for federal financial crimes.\nHe is also serving 27 years for nearly two dozen state financial charges relating to fraud and money laundering.",
    "Jamaican dancehall artist Vybz Kartel has been freed from prison after judges decided he should not face a retrial for murder.\nThe 48-year-old, real name Adidja Palmer, was jailed in 2014 but his conviction was overturned by UK judges in March.\nHe had been accused of killing of Clive \"Lizard\" Williams in Jamaica but has always maintained his innocence.\nAlthough his conviction was overturned months ago by the Privy Council in London, authorities in Jamaica had time to decide whether he should be retried.\nOn Wednesday, appeal judges in Jamaica decided the case would not go back to court, meaning Kartel, who is said to be in poor health, could be released.\nHis trial in 2014 heard that victim Clive Williams and another man, Lamar Chow, were given two unlicensed firearms belonging to Kartel for safekeeping.\nWhen they failed to return them at an agreed time, prosecutors said they were summoned to Kartel's house in August 2011.\nChow told the trial they were attacked and the last thing he saw was Clive Williams - who was never seen alive again - lying motionless on the ground.\nThe house burned down days later and his body has never been found. \nKartel and his co-accused Shawn Campbell, Kahira Jones and Andre St John, have always maintained their innocence but were convicted and jailed for life, with Kartel told he would spend a minimum of 35 years in prison.\nHe appealed first to courts in Jamaica before taking his case to the Privy Council in London, which serves as the highest court of appeal in Jamaica and other Commonwealth countries. \nHis defence team argued that a juror accused of trying to bribe others should have been thrown off his trial.\nThe London court agreed with Kartel's case and ruled in March that the decision not to remove the juror made the conviction unsafe.\nThe judges said it was \"fatal to the safety of the convictions which followed\" and \"an infringement of the [defendants'] fundamental right to a fair hearing\".\nOn Wednesday, Justice Marva McDonald-Bishop, one of three judges sitting at Jamaica's Court of Appeal, said they had weighed up the \"egregious nature and seriousness of the offence\" against the passage of time, lack of access to witnesses and evidence and the huge expense of a retrial.\nShe also said Kartel was in \"declining health\" and a new trial would have an impact on his physical and mental wellbeing. \n\"We conclude that the interests of justice do not require a new trial,\" she said, adding that Kartel and his co-defendants were formally acquitted. \nAccording to the AFP news agency, there was heavy security at the courthouse in Jamaica's capital, Kingston, and the hearing was closely watched across the country.\n\nVybez is known as one of Jamaica's most popular artists and has collaborated with performers such as Jay-Z, Eminem and Rihanna.\nHis best-known hits include Clarks, Ramping Shop and Summer Time, and his success led to him launching lines of shoes, alcohol and condoms.\nThe singer also became the first dancehall artist to star in his own reality TV show, Teacha's Pet.\nSeani B, who presents 1Xtra's Dancehall Show, tells BBC Newsbeat Kartel's release represents \"a mammoth day for Jamaica, a mammoth day for dancehall music, and a mammoth day for the Jamaica judicial system\".\n\"He's easily one of the biggest dancehall artists in Jamaica,\" Seani says.\n\"And for the last 14 years, Kartel has probably become even more infamous. Now on his release, I would say he's returned to a space that's been awaiting him for so many years.\n\"There's a whole new generation of dancehall fans that are just waiting for Vybz Kartel's return to that music.\"\nSeani was DJing at Boxpark in Croydon, south London, on Wednesday and says he was on his phone backstage listening to the court's ruling.\n\"When it was announced, it was jubilant.\n\"It's a relief for a lot of people but at the same time, we've got to think about the family of the person that was murdered so many years ago.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "As sets of steps go, they don't come much grander than those in the New York State Capitol in Albany.\nConstructed in the second half of the 19th Century, the \"million-dollar staircase\" remains an impressive sight.\nPart of the reason for its hefty price tag was that it used sandstone shipped from southern Scotland - Corsehill Quarry near Annan.\nStone cutters and carvers also made the journey from small towns and villages like Lochmaben, Creca and Brydekirk to help complete the project.\nTheir work, and the transatlantic links it forged, are being celebrated in an exhibition at Kirkcudbright Galleries.\n\"It's a project I've wanted to do for a number of years because I'm from near Annan, Eastriggs,\" explained artist Hugh Bryden.\n\"So I grew up close to Corsehill Quarry, and I grew up in Annan with all the tales of how Annan sandstone went across to New York.\"\nAs well as the 444-step staircase which is 119ft (36m) high, there are also 77 famous faces - and many more less famous ones - carved throughout its length.\nIt actually cost $1.5m to build - the equivalent of more than $30m (\u00a325m) nowadays - and took 14 years to construct.\nIt was inspired by the Paris Opera House and designed by architect Henry Hobson Richardson who died before it was finished and the work was completed by Isaac Perry.\nHugh said the story of Scotland's role was not an easy one to piece together.\n\"They were transporting 250 tonnes of sandstone a week across to build this magnificent staircase in Albany,\" he said.\n\"But it really got forgotten because there was a fire in 1911 in Albany and the staircase was closed for years.\n\"I think it's probably during that time that the myth grew up in Annan of the sandstone being dumped in New York harbour and the Statue of Liberty being built on it, which is a total myth.\"\nThe skills of the stone workers from southern Scotland were also called into play for the staircase.\n\"Over the period of building the staircase and then doing the magnificent carving on the staircase there were lots of of artists and carvers,\" said Hugh.\n\"Some of the carvers did come from Brydekirk, Lochmaben and the Thornhill area.\"\nDue to the fire, the only records that remain are of one worker who died during construction but Hugh said the Scots left their mark in other ways on the creation of famous faces.\n\"The remit was to carve famous Americans and they began and they carved poets, they carved generals, they carved the governors of New York State and they ran out at 77,\" he said.\n\"Then, when they asked the architect: 'What do you want us to do?', he said: 'As long as the heads are of this standard, I don't mind'.\n\"So they began by carving Robert Burns and then they moved on to carving each other and their families.\n\"There are heads very reminiscent of the heads you see in Annan High Street on the staircase in Albany.\"\nThe Sandstone Steps exhibition is a true team effort between New York and southern Scotland involving art, poetry and music.\nHugh's son Ben Bryden and his long-time collaborator Hugh McMillan have provided the Scottish input alongside New Yorkers Desiree Alvarez, Rohin Khemani and Maddy Rosenberg.\nAt its heart is a limited edition book in a three-tier staircase wooden box with each step holding its own \"artistic event\".\nMaddy said she was hooked by a project which gave her a \"good reason to be back in Scotland\".\n\"He actually came to New York with a proposal that was mostly about the fantastic history and backgrounds of the sandstone,\" she said.\nShe said it had never previously \"clicked\" that this was the type of stone used in the buildings referred to in the US as brownstones.\n\"Corsehill sandstone was the finest sandstone and that's why the architects demanded it for the staircase,\" she explained.\n\"They had worked on it in the brownstones in New York.\n\"It was the kind of sandstone that was very soft to the touch and can get really fine detail but then, once it hardens, it hardens.\n\"So it didn't have the property of of basically wearing away and it could be used outdoors as well.\"\nShe said, like most New Yorkers, she had been unaware of the Scottish links.\n\"A lot of people don't even realise that the capital of New York State is not New York City, it's up the Hudson in Albany,\" she said.\n\"I had visited Albany before and I had seen the magnificent staircase and Hugh had pictures of it - he had never seen it.\n\"He told me the story behind it and I said: 'You have got to see the staircase'.\"\nSo they took a tour and - over a period of a number of years - the project came together, resulting in the exhibition.\nBoth artists are happy with how it has turned out.\n\"There are lots of links with with New York and it's sad that, by and large, they've been lost,\" said Hugh.\n\"You know, it'd be nice to have those things back.\n\"So, maybe, this is a small start.\"",
    "A piece of treasure which dates back to the 1600s and is a \"reminder of death\" is one of seven pieces of history uncovered by metal detectorists in Cornwall recently.\nA number of items were put forward as part of a treasure inquest on 22 July.\nOther finds include Bronze Age arrow heads, an 18th century gold skull ring and a gold Bronze Age bracelet, which were all ruled as treasure by the coroner. \nLaura Miucci said there were \"a lot of prehistoric finds\" in Cornwall and \"significant finds\". \nA treasure inquest is a hearing to determine whether objects found are treasure so museums can acquire them. \nOne of the finds was a silver seal matrix, used to make an impression on a wax seal.\nThe matrix dates back to the 1600 to 1700s, and Ms Miucci said it was a \"memento mori\", which means to be mindful of death. \nShe said: \"When you look at the matrix  you can see a skeleton holding an arrow pointing to the ground to suggest you will end up in the ground, we will all go to the earth, and an hourglass in the other hand.\"\nShe added: \"The 1500s to the 1800s we had this period where people are obsessed with death, cheating death and living as long as possible.\n\"All these different herbal remedies, as you can imagine lots of plagues around that time so you look to God, to religion to save you from dying too young. \n\"That's what's so poignant about this matrix it's a memento mori, you remember you will die.\" \nAnother item found to be treasure was a bracelet which dates back to the Pennard phase. \nThis was a metalworking phase of the Bronze Age in Britain from 1140 to 1275. \nMs Miucci said: \"What was particularly interesting about this piece is it was very twisted, almost as if someone has got the gold whilst it's relatively molten and twisted it around, so it looks really pretty.\n\"The twist is done while it's being made rather than during deposition. This was intentional and deliberately made as a decorative element.\"\nA strap end from a sword was also found in Cornwall. \nIt was found the object contains more than 10% precious metal and is more than 300 years old.\nMs Miucci said it was a \"rare find\". \nShe said: \"You can see people have gilded gold onto this strap end and twisted it in such a way it makes beautiful spiral. \n\"Each spiral is twisted gold, which is obviously some delicate work which has taken some time to do. The inset looks to be garnet.\"\nShe said the garnet, a type of gemstone, could be native to Cornwall. \n\"We rarely find such beautiful anglosaxon early medieval finds in Cornwall like this. It's been compared to some of the really big treasure hoards over the years.\"\nA gold ring with a skull engraved onto it was another item at the treasure inquest.\nMs Miucci said it was another 'memento mori' item - a reminder of death. \nShe said: \"It's quite a popular style of mourning ring, it's quite a plain band with a skull in black enamel on the outside and the initials and date of death of the person who died on the interior of the ring.\n\"What's particularly interesting about this is it's a memento mori ring and also a mourning ring.\"\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "\u201cThis represents Northern Ireland\u2019s place in the Cold War.\u201d\nArchaeologist Rhonda Robinson can\u2019t hide her enthusiasm as we walk down a dark, sterile stairway.\nWe\u2019re going to the underground level of Northern Ireland\u2019s forgotten nuclear bunker.\nWhat makes the situation all the more surreal is that only moments ago we were above ground among the suburbs of south Belfast.\nThe large, windowless, concrete structure that sits among houses in Mount Eden Park, near Malone Road, was once known as The War Room.\nI\u2019ve been given rare access to the bunker ahead of it being repurposed as an archive for government documents.\nThe building was first opened in 1952 as one of 13 Regional Government War Rooms throughout the UK.\nIt came in the aftermath of the detonation of the first nuclear weapon by America in 1945 and the development of atomic weapons by Russia in 1949.\nIt was constructed with the intention of being capable to withstand a nuclear attack, complete with blast doors and concrete walls that are 1.5m thick.\nThe Cold War (1947 to 1991) refers to the period after World War Two when growing tensions between the Soviet Union and the US led to an arms race and the threat of renewed conflict.\nWith both sides owning huge nuclear arsenals, the world faced the real possibility of nuclear conflict.\nIn Northern Ireland, these events may have appeared distant, with the Troubles dominating local news during the latter part of this period. \nBut the Cold War did have an impact.\nDr James O\u2019Neill is a heritage consultant with a specialism in Cold War-era buildings.\nHe said: \u201cThe UK government realised they had to set up facilities for civil defence should the Cold War turn hot, so they built the war room here in Mount Eden.\n\u201cThe setting might seem surprising, but it was meant to be out of the primary and secondary blast range of any atomic weapons aimed at Belfast city centre. Thankfully that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nShould such an attack have occurred, the War Room would have coordinated things like search and recovery operations.\nLocated on the ground floor of the bunker is a huge empty space that used to be known as the map room.\nA space where large windows used to be currently looks out at a blank wall.\nThis was the former location of a giant map of Northern Ireland where information on the nuclear fallout would have been displayed.\nHaving walls 1.5m thick with re-enforced concrete meant the nuclear radiation would have been reduced by a factor of 400.\nThe building was also complete with a ventilation system circulating fresh air and a pressure system that kept any nuclear dangers outside.\nBut Dr O\u2019Neill said the usefulness of the bunker was short-lived.\n\u201cThey finished the war room here by about 1953 but during that decade hydrogen bombs were developed and that changed everything -  the building became obsolete,\" he said.\n\u201cThe bunker was designed for nuclear fallout, but hydrogen weapons could crush this place like a beer tin.\u201d\nIn 1958, the War Room moved to a location in Armagh.\nIn 1980, the Mount Eden Park bunker temporarily became a training facility for co-ordinating large-scale public emergencies.\nTen years later, another bunker designed to deal specifically with nuclear disasters was opened in Ballymena.\nThe Mount Eden Park bunker has gathered dust for decades, until now.\nThe listed building is going to be a new archive store for the Department for Communities\u2019 (DfC) historical environment records.\nRhonda Robinson, principal archaeologist for DfC, said the building was \"one of a kind\".\n\u201cWe want to make sure we look after these archives and find a sustainable reuse for rare buildings, so this is a great combination.\n\u201cThe fact that this building is very cold, has thick walls and no windows, makes it perfect for archive storage.\"\nThe Department for Communities said it hopes to start construction on the  renovation later this year.",

    "Northern Ireland is far from a byword for stable government.\nBut unlikely as it sounds, it currently has the longest serving government leaders across Ireland and Great Britain.\nIt has been six months since Stormont's devolved government was restored following a two-year hiatus.\nSince then much has changed politically across these isles, with a new prime minister, new taoiseach (Irish PM) and new first ministers in Scotland and Wales.\nSix months in, how is the Northern Ireland Executive faring?\nRemaining intact so far will, for some, be regarded as a success in itself.\nBut others say its return has yet to be properly tested, with many key decisions still outstanding.\nA significant omission is the Programme for Government, in which the executive is supposed to set out its priorities for the years ahead.\nWhile Labour outlined its plans in the King\u2019s Speech within a fortnight of winning the UK general election, a similar policy blueprint for Northern Ireland remains elusive.\nIt is a \"big shortcoming in these first six months\", according to Ann Watt, director of the Northern Ireland think tank Pivotal.\n\"As a result, it's not clear what the executive's priorities are or how we can expect public services to improve,\" she said.\nUnlike Labour with its landslide majority, the Stormont executive has the significant added challenge of being a four-party coalition.\nMs Watt acknowledged there has been \"positivity and purpose\" around the return of the power-sharing institutions.\nFirst Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn F\u00e9in, and Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), have engaged in community outreach with a number of joint photocalls and engagements.\nThey attended a Northern Ireland women's soccer match at Windsor Park in south Belfast, and tried out the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) sport of camogie in the west of the city.\nMs Watt said they had \"clearly made serious efforts to work together and present a united front\". \n\"The executive appears to be working in a business-like and constructive way, which has not always been the case in the past,\" she added.\nBut Esmond Birnie, a senior economist at Ulster University, said judging success simply on pragmatic relationships would \"set the bar too low\".\nHe said the executive agreeing a budget was \"an achievement of sorts\", although one minister voted against it.\n\"Collective responsibility is still absent in the executive,\" he added.\nDr Birnie said some \"rather important and necessary\" considerations remain unresolved, such as the \"conditions\" attached to a \u00a33.3bn UK government funding package for the restored executive.\n\"The UK government is looking for substantial revenue-raising efforts by the executive - a figure of \u00a3113m. So far there is little indication of what the executive intends to do,\" he added.\nThe economist pointed to how ministers have ruled out domestic water charges and there has been \"no sign\" of early reforms to the rates system - a tax based on property values.\n\"The UK government requires the executive to publish - and then implement - a plan as to how it will 'stabilise' its finances over the medium term. Where is that plan?\"\nFinance Minister Caoimhe Archibald has managed to negotiate with the UK Treasury an interim fiscal deal to enhance funding arrangements for Stormont.\nBut with Labour warning of a \u00a322bn \"hole\" in the UK's public finances, Ms Watt said \"it's not realistic to expect big new injections of government funding\".\n\"This will involve difficult and perhaps unpopular decisions,\" she said.\nAndrew McCormick, a former senior Stormont civil servant, said the executive was, so far, \"not remotely gripping the really difficult issues\".\nHe in particular highlighted the problems in Northern Ireland's health service, which has the worst waiting lists in the UK.\nDr McCormick questioned how the political discourse has instead tended to focus on issues such as redeveloping Casement Park GAA stadium.\nHe said the issues in healthcare would not be resolved overnight, but \"if we\u2019re not talking about them\" he warned that \"you're just perpetuating failure\".\nHe said they must \"get right down to the heart of the issues in a serious way.\"\nMatthew O'Toole, leader of the opposition in Northern Ireland's legislative assembly, argued the executive's first six months have prioritised \"photo opportunities over substance\".\nThe Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) assembly member said executive parties have \"passed dozens of motions on every conceivable subject\", but have \"failed to publish a Programme for Government with clear targets\".\nTo deliver those targets, Stormont's executive and assembly must remain standing - far from a guarantee based on past experience.\nIn the 26 years since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement peace deal which formed the institutions, they have been suspended for about 10 of them.\nThe most recent two-year collapse resulted from the DUP walking away in a row over post-Brexit trade arrangements.\nIt e",

    "Three men who took part in \"appalling\" violence following the Southport knife attack have have been jailed.\nGareth Metcalfe, 44, and Philip Prescot, 38, admitted being involved in rioting outside a mosque in the Merseyside town on 30 July.\nThe disorder saw missiles thrown at police and broke out shortly after a vigil to remember three girls killed at the Taylor Swift-themed dance class. \nMetcalfe, of Cambridge Gardens, was jailed for three years and four months while Prescot, of Sefton Street, was jailed for two years and four months. David Hill, 38, of Bootle, was handed a two-year jail term after admitting kicking the wing mirror off a police van on 3 August in Liverpool.\nMerseyside Police said Prescott was part of a crowd who gathered near the Southport mosque at the corner of Sussex Road and Zetland Street when the unrest began.\nHe threw missiles at officers including a brick from a damaged garden wall before he was arrested six days later after police recognised him in the town.\nMetcalfe was identified from social media footage, police said.\nHill, of Bianca Street, was identified on CCTV taking part in disorder on William Brown Street in Liverpool.\nThe trio were sentenced together because his Honour Judge Flewitt KC said the events in Southport and Liverpool \"shared a common context\".\nThe prosecution said they had contributed to events that left Southport\u2019s streets \"littered with debris\" and required a \"community clear up operation\" including rebuilding of the wall at the front of the mosque.\nJudge Flewitt said the Southport disturbances \"was clearly racially or religiously motivated disorder, targeting primarily the Muslim community but also the police officers doing their best to protect them and their property\".\n\"This particular incident was made all the more serious by the fact that it took place soon after and in the same area as the tragic events of the previous day,\" he said.\n\"I have no doubt your actions added to the distress already felt by the local community.\"\nMetcalfe's defence had claimed he had been swept up in the anger which unfolded in the town, whilst Prescott's defence pointed out that was drunk at the time.\nHill's defence team said he had been homeless since his conditional release from a previous custodial sentence and had struggles with drug addiction.\nThey also said he was \"not a member of a political party or any group organised to attend these events\".\nAssistant Chief Constable Paul White said: \"There are now 11 people in prison following disorder in Merseyside and this number is only going to increase in the days and weeks ahead.\"\nHe warned anyone thinking of getting involved in this \"appalling\" type of criminality that the force would \"take all necessary steps to bring you to justice\".\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight says American rapper Snoop Dogg told him how much he relates to the show.\nMr Knight told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs how the rapper talked about his life and family when the two met, and said the show \"reminded him of how he got involved in gang culture\". \nMeeting Snoop Dogg made the creator understand Peaky Blinders \"is pretty universal\", with people from Eastern Europe to Buenos Aires \"getting it and feeling the same thing\".  \nMr Knight, who based the hit show and a forthcoming film on stories from his parents and his own childhood in Birmingham, also co-created game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire?.\nPeaky Blinders followed gangsters in 1920s Birmingham. The show ran for six seasons, from 2013 to 2022, and starred Cillian Murphy, who won the best actor Oscar for Oppenheimer this year, as Tommy Shelby. \nMr Murphy will reprise his role as Shelby in the film version. \nThe show aired in 180 countries and counts celebrities including Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise among its fans. \nMr Knight described meeting celebrity fan Snoop Dogg and his manager in a room - the rapper smoking, him drinking beer, and the manager gin. \nHearing about Snoop Dogg's life was \"really interesting\", he said.\n\"It was all about family keeping you in, and escaping from family to do the bad stuff, and then the family relocating their emotions and loyalties to follow you, and then escaping again,\" he said. \n\"He was such a great bloke. He was so nice to talk to,\" Mr Knight added. \nMr Knight, who grew up as the youngest of seven kids, said Peaky Blinders was inspired by myth-like stories his parents told him about their childhoods. \nWhen his mother was around eight or nine, she worked for bookmakers - who were called peaky blinders - when betting was illegal. \nIn her adult life, she worked as a cleaner and in a factory, supergluing grit to the soles of her shoes so she could get to work when it snowed. \nHis father was a blacksmith who received work from a nearby Romany camp and scrap metal yard. \n\"The people we would meet were so larger than life, so rebellious, they were so on the other side of the law, but really warm and great people,\" Mr Knight said. \nHe wanted to get some of that \"respect for one's own life\" into Peaky Blinders, showing that people living \"big, glamorous, dramatic lives\" had emotions and passions that \"are the same as anybody else\".  \nMr Knight said he began writing poetry around the age of 10. His first job after university was writing commercials for local Birmingham radio before he moved to work in radio and production in London. \nIt was in London where he and two colleagues created Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, the game show that became globally successful.\nHe also wrote the film Dirty Pretty Things, which was nominated for an Oscar for best original screenplay in 2004, and three novels. \nMr Knight is now writing a Star Wars script and recently opened a TV and film studio in Birmingham called Digbeth Loc, where the Peaky Blinders film will be shot.\n\"It's a fitting end to this part of the story, and we\u2019ve got an absolutely fantastic cast,\" the writer said. \"I want it to be a sort of legacy for Birmingham, but also a place where people come who want to do different stuff, brave stuff, bold stuff.\" \nHe also started a scheme financing courses for local people to get trained in film industry trades.\n\"We want this to be absolutely part of the community and for local people to be walking to work,\" he said. \nMr Knight said that growing up working class \"you have no expectation of yourself\" and it took him until he was 35 to think \"I can actually do this\".\nNow, whenever he gives talks, such as one recently at his old school, he says: \"You\u2019ve got to understand you are as good as someone else, you just haven\u2019t had the same guidance.\" \nSteven Knight is on Desert Island Discs at 10:00 BST on Sunday 11 August and is available afterwards on BBC Sounds.",
    "South Yorkshire Police have confirmed that 10 of their officers were injured after rioters forced their way into a hotel housing asylum seekers.\nIn a full statement on the incident at the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham over the weekend, the force condemed \"deplorable acts of violence\" that left one officer unconscious and others with broken bones.\nA heavy police presence will remain at the hotel on Monday following the anti-immigration demonstration.\nAssistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield said that members of the crowd who watched the disorder were \"absolutely complicit\" in it.\nACC Butterfield also criticised people who had used social media to \"spread misinformation and hate\" ahead of the planned protest.\nShe said: \u201cThose people also need to take responsibility for the scenes we saw. This was not a protest, just angry people, reacting to a false narrative, shared by people who have their own motivations for doing so.\u201d\nSouth Yorkshire Police estimated that 700 people were in attendance. The Holiday Inn's windows were smashed and missiles including wood, glass bottles and beer cans were thrown at officers.\nPolice were also sprayed with fire extinguishers. One officer suffered a head injury and another a suspected fractured elbow.\nOne person has been arrested, but the force said officers would be reviewing images and videos shared online to track down more offenders.\nACC Butterfield added: \u201cPlease be assured, our work does not end on Sunday - we have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon.\u201d\nDuring the violence, a large bin close to a window of the hotel was set alight.

    "Early on Friday morning, a 31-year-old female trainee doctor retired to sleep in a  seminar hall after a gruelling day at one of India\u2019s oldest hospitals.\nIt was the last time she was seen alive.\nThe next morning, her colleagues discovered her half-naked body on the podium, bearing extensive injuries. Police later arrested a hospital volunteer worker in connection with what they say is a case of rape and murder at Kolkata\u2019s 138-year-old RG Kar Medical College.\nTens of thousands of women in Kolkata and across West Bengal state are expected to participate in a 'Reclaim the Night' march at midnight on Wednesday, demanding the \"independence to live in freedom and without fear\". The march takes place just before India's Independence Day on Thursday. Outraged doctors have struck work both in the city and across India, demanding a strict federal law to protect them.\nThe tragic incident has again cast a spotlight on the violence against doctors and nurses in the country. Reports of doctors, regardless of gender, being assaulted by patients and their relatives have gained widespread attention. Women - who make up nearly 30% of India\u2019s doctors and 80% of the nursing staff - are more vulnerable than their male colleagues. \nThe crime in the Kolkata hospital last week exposed the alarming security risks faced by the medical staff in many of India's state-run health facilities.\nAt RG Kar Hospital, which sees over 3,500 patients daily, the overworked trainee doctors - some working up to 36 hours straight - had no designated rest rooms, forcing them to seek rest in a third-floor seminar room. \nReports indicate that the arrested suspect, a volunteer worker with a troubled past, had unrestricted access to the ward and was captured on CCTV. Police allege that no background checks were conducted on the volunteer.\n\"The hospital has always been our first home; we only go home to rest. We never imagined it could be this unsafe. Now, after this incident, we're terrified,\" says Madhuparna Nandi, a junior doctor at Kolkata\u2019s 76-year-old National Medical College.\nDr Nandi\u2019s own journey highlights how female doctors in India's government hospitals have become resigned to working in conditions that compromise their security. \nAt her hospital, where she is a resident in gynaecology and obstetrics, there are no designated rest rooms and separate toilets for female doctors.\n\u201cI use the patients\u2019 or the nurses' toilets if they allow me. When I work late, I sometimes sleep in an empty patient bed in the ward or in a cramped waiting room with a bed and basin,\u201d Dr Nandi told me.\nShe says she feels insecure even in the room where she rests after 24-hour shifts that start with outpatient duty and continue through ward rounds and maternity rooms.\nOne night in 2021, during the peak of the Covid pandemic, some men barged into her room and woke her by touching her, demanding, \u201cGet up, get up. See our patient.\u201d\n\u201cI was completely shaken by the incident. But we never imagined it would come to a point where a doctor could be raped and murdered in the hospital,\u201d Dr Nandi says.\nWhat happened on Friday was not an isolated incident. The most shocking case remains that of Aruna Shanbaug, a nurse at a prominent Mumbai hospital, who was left in a persistent vegetative state after being raped and strangled by a ward attendant in 1973. She died in 2015, after 42 years of severe brain damage and paralysis. More recently, in Kerala, Vandana Das, a 23-year-old medical intern, was fatally stabbed with surgical scissors by a drunken patient last year.\nIn overcrowded government hospitals with unrestricted access, doctors often face mob fury from patients' relatives after a death or over demands for immediate treatment. Kamna Kakkar, an anaesthetist, remembers a harrowing incident during a night shift in an intensive care unit (ICU) during the pandemic in 2021 at her hospital in Haryana in northern India.\n\u201cI was the lone doctor in the ICU when three men, flaunting a politician\u2019s name, forced their way in, demanding a much in-demand controlled drug. I gave in to protect myself, knowing the safety of my patients was at stake,\" Dr Kakkar told me.\nNamrata Mitra, a Kolkata-based pathologist who studied at the RG Kar Medical College, says her doctor father would often accompany her to work because she felt unsafe.\n\u201cDuring my on-call duty, I took my father with me. Everyone laughed, but I had to sleep in a room tucked away in a long, dark corridor with a locked iron gate that only the nurse could open if a patient arrived,\u201d Dr Mitra wrote in a Facebook post over the weekend.\n\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to admit I was scared. What if someone from the ward - an attendant, or even a patient - tried something? I took advantage of the fact that my father was a doctor, but not everyone has that privilege.\u201d\nWhen she was working in a public health centre in a district in West Bengal, Dr Mitra spent nights in a dilapidated one-storey building that served as the doctor\u2019s hostel.\n\u201cFrom dusk, a gro",

    "ITV has been criticised after Good Morning Britain presenter Ed Balls interviewed his wife, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, on Monday's programme.\nThe former Labour MP and his co-host Kate Garraway interviewed Cooper  following the recent wave of violent unrest across England.\nPolice officers have faced attacks in recent days, while shops have been broken into and cars set on fire.\nIn response to accusations that the interview represented a conflict of interest, an ITV spokesman told the BBC it considered its interviews \"fair and duly impartial\".\n\"Following a weekend of rioting and national unrest, GMB featured a range of interviews and discussion around this national emergency on today\u2019s programme,\" the broadcaster told BBC News.\n\"[These] included James Cleverly, Shadow Home Secretary and Yvette Cooper, Home Secretary.\n\"We are satisfied that these interviews were balanced, fair and duly impartial.\"\nThe programme attracted criticism on social media after it aired, with some viewers suggesting it raised issues of bias and conflict of interest.\nDeadline\u2019s Jake Kanter posted on X: \"'Still to come, the home secretary will be joining us shortly, who Ed of course is married to.' Actual words said this morning on a TV channel with a legal duty to impartiality.\n\"Baffling it was allowed to happen.\"\nOther viewers described the dynamic of the interview as \"absurd\" and \"untenable\".\nOver the last week, police have faced violence in Rotherham, Middlesbrough, Bristol, Bolton and other parts of the UK.\nShops and hotels have been broken into, while cars and bins have been set on fire and officers attacked. \nThe exchange on Monday's programme aired before the government\u2019s emergency Cobra meeting. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has since announced a \"standing army\" of specialist police officers to tackle violent protests.\nThe unrest follows a stabbing attack in Southport last week in which three children attending a dance class were killed.\nBalls and Cooper have been married since 1998, and have three children.\nEarlier in the programme, Balls told Garraway he \"had not seen [Cooper] at all in the last week\", amid the fallout of the riots.\n\"When these events happen, and if you're the prime minister or the home secretary, it becomes pretty much 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so it's tough,\" he commented.\nWhen Garraway replied: \"So you have genuine questions you need answers to?\" He said: \"Absolutely.\"\nAfter Garraway kicked off the interview, Balls said: \"Can I ask, because we've talked about this a few times in the last few days, like many of our viewers will have done at home since those terrible killings in Southport, there have been identifiable individuals on social media, who have been inciting not just riots but violence.\n\"They've been using racist language. They've been using falsehoods about what happened in Southport.\n\"This is this is happening on the social media platforms. What can be done, what should be done now by the social media companies and the police and the Government to stop this happening, because it's been happening for a week?\"\nBalls also questioned Cooper on whether there has been a \"two-tier approach\" to policing, and if police have been \"softer and more cautious\" when policing the Gaza demonstrations, compared to a \"tougher\" approach over the last week.\nCooper replied that police have to operate \"without fear or favour, whatever the kinds of crimes it is that they face\".\nViewers have also criticised an earlier debate on the programme, between Balls, Garraway and Labour MP Zarah Sultana.\nIn the item, Sultana said the behaviour of riots should be considered Islamophobic as well as racist. \nNadine White, the Independent\u2019s race correspondent, said Balls \"sneered at her\" in response, and criticised the rest of the panel, who she described as \"white commentators with no lived experience of racism\".\nBBC News has contacted a spokesperson for Balls for comment. \nIslamophobic slurs were heard in the unrest on Saturday and Sunday, and mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers were targeted.\nBalls was a Labour MP from 2005 to 2015, and acted as shadow chancellor. He became a TV personality after competing in Strictly Come Dancing in 2016.\nHe is one of several rotating hosts to have presented ITV's breakfast show in recent years, along with Richard Madeley, Adil Ray and Robert Rinder, following the departure of Piers Morgan.\nBalls first appeared as a guest presenter on Good Morning Britain in 2021, and joined their rotating presenter line-up regularly the following year.",

    "A fleet of hospital hopper buses have been named after local \"healthcare heroes\" in honour of their outstanding contributions to patient care.\nThe electric Hopper shuttle buses connect Glenfield Hospital, Leicester Royal Infirmary and Leicester General Hospital seven days a week.\nFour distinctive green vehicles will now bear the names of a quartet who have been influential in local healthcare. \nOne of the honourees, Dr Sanjiv Nichani, said it was \"surreal\" to see the bus named after him.\nThe four names, voted on by the public, were revealed at a ceremony at Glenfield Hospital on Wednesday. \nDr Nichani spearheaded the creation of Leicester Children's Hospital and founded Healing Little Hearts Global Foundation, one of the biggest children's heart charities in the world. \n\"It's surreal,\" he said. \"Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined something like this would have happened. \n\"I'm delighted, thrilled, honoured to have an electric bus driving through the city where I live, where I love living in and working in with my name on.\"\nA bus has also been named after Professor Sally Singh, the current head of pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation at the hospital. \nProfessor Tony Gershlick, consultant cardiologist at Glenfield Hospital from 1989, has also been honoured. \nHe was involved in practice-changing research, running major national and international trials that have changed the way patients are treated before his death in 2020. \nThe name of Frances Deacon, who was born in Kibworth Beauchamp in 1837, has also been put on one of the fleet. \nShe was the first woman to pass tough qualifying tests to become a pharmacist.\nThe Hospital Hopper buses were made electric in 2022, replacing a fleet of diesel vehicles.\nJon Melbourne, chief operating officer at Leicester's Hospitals, said: \u201cOur sustainable fleet of Hospital Hopper buses serve the local community every day.\n\"Naming them after people who have achieved so much, with legacies felt not just here but around the world is a fitting tribute to their dedication and trailblazing spirit.\u201d\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A consultation about a major solar farm in Nottinghamshire has shown the scale of the opposition it faces to being built.\nPlanned for an area north-west of Newark, the Great North Road Solar Park has the potential to power up to 400,000 homes - the equivalent to all of the homes in the county.\nThe consultation, held in January and February, found 54% of respondents opposed the scheme, with 16% supporting the current plan.\nAmong the main reasons people gave for opposing the scheme were its visual and ecological impact.\nThe farm would form a ring roughly 10km (6.2 miles) from north to south around the villages of Caunton and Norwell, with the eastern edge alongside the A1.\nIt would be made up of around 1.5 million panels and cover 7,000 acres - enough space for 4,000 football pitches.\nThe consultation has been published by developers Elements Green.\nAbout 230 people responded to the survey, with 54.2% saying they were against the project, 26.4% wanting changes to be made in order to support it, and 16.3% saying they backed it.\nOn the general question of whether people thought ground-based solar panels were needed in the UK, 39% of people agreed, while 48% disagreed.\nThe survey also suggested the greatest concern of residents was the visual impact of the installation, closely followed by its effect on local ecology and loss of agricultural land.\nIan Harrison, chairman of the Joint Parish Council Action Group, said: \"The concern is the loss of landscape, the loss of the brilliant ecology - I've just been watching a buzzard flying overhead.\n\"Then there is the flood risk. This area is already prone to flooding.\n\"And then there is the loss of agricultural food land.\"\nElements Green said it would use this feedback to \"shape a strong set of proposals that are sensitive to and respect the views and recommendations of local communities\".\nCommenting on the report, Mark Noone, the company's head of UK development, said: \u201cThis is a nationally significant scheme which takes advantage of the grid connections left over from the big power stations which were here.\n\"The feedback we received during the first phase of consultation has helped our team to improve our understanding of the local environment and the aspects of Great North Road Solar Park that local communities considered most important for us to prioritise as we further develop our proposals.\"\nA second consultation will begin at the end of the year. \nIf approval is given by the government, construction is due to start in 2027.\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A farmer has spoken of his frustration after National Grid dug up a field two days before a barley crop was due to be harvested. \nRichard Langton, of Langton Farms in Little Wenham, Suffolk, said he made an agreement with National Grid so they could work on his land with 48 hours' notice - and after the harvest.\nSeven of his fields are likely to be disrupted by the Tilbury to Norwich pylon scheme, causing the fields to become \"devalued\", he said. \nA spokesperson for National Grid said the agreement was \"not communicated to the survey team\" and it would compensate for any crops lost. \nNational Grid wants to install a 114-mile (184km) power line of pylons stretching from south Norwich to Tilbury in Essex, to carry electricity generated from offshore windfarms.\nMr Langton, said: \"It's so wet this winter... it's been a struggle to get a lot of crops to harvest this year. \n\"It's frustrating days before harvest that they start digging it up.\"\nMr Langton, 62, had given permission to the National Grid survey team - but with strict conditions.\n\"It's slightly arrogant on National Grid's thinking that they can just do what they want now... it feels like it's big companies bulldozing their way through the countryside,\" he said.\n\"I don't particularly want the pylons on my farm at all, I admit that, but who would?\"\nGeorgina Langton-McColl, 34, works with her father on the farm and says the experience has been \"very upsetting\" and \"distressing\". \n\"My father and the team who work so hard all year round to prepare for the pinnacle in our year, to turn up and see it being destroyed, is pretty distressing.\"\nShe said that for many farmers there was \"a lot riding\" on the next few weeks. \n\"It's a very busy time of year for us, we don't really have the bandwidth to be trying to get through to National Grid and speak to them,\" she said.\n\"We've got other much bigger priorities like our livelihoods to go away and manage.\"\nA spokesperson for National Grid said it was \"committed\" to working closely, fairly and consistently with farmers along the proposed pylon route. \n\"While we had an agreement in place with the landowner to carry out environmental surveys, they had asked us to wait until harvesting,\" they said.\n\"On this occasion this was not communicated to the survey team and a small section of their land was accessed. \n\"We have apologised to the landowner and will compensate for any loss of crop.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A special care baby unit has said it is now able to diagnose jaundice within minutes, describing it as a \"real game changer\".\nAll babies are regularly checked for jaundice - a yellowing of the whites of the eyes and skin - in the first few days of life, as, although it is common, the condition can cause serious problems if not treated at the right time. \nBut following a research project, two neonatal nurses from Yeovil District Hospital say they have reduced the diagnosis time at the hospital from seven hours to three minutes.\nStaff nurse Eleonora Forbes said this meant treatment is not only much more efficient, but that babies are not jaundice for so long, meaning \"they\u2019re less likely to experience any complications\".\nShe added: \"Sometimes if the jaundice gets so high, we aren\u2019t able to treat it at Yeovil District Hospital so the baby has to be transferred to Musgrove Park Hospital, or even Bristol Children\u2019s Hospital, so starting it early can only be a good thing for everyone.\"\nJaundice is usually harmless and often goes away on its own, but it can be the sign of an underlying health condition. \nAccording to the NHS, treatment is usually only recommended if tests show very high levels of bilirubin [a yellow substance produced when the body breaks down old red blood cells] in the baby's blood, as there is a small risk it could pass into the brain and cause brain damage.\nMs Forbes, along with senior sister Beth Hawken, investigated re-admissions to hospital of small babies with jaundice, including the time it took for them to be reviewed by a doctor and when their bloods were taken.\nHs Hawken explained: \u201cWe also looked at the time it took for their bloods to get to the lab, how long the processing took, and the timeframe that a clinician reacted to the result\u2026all the way through to the baby\u2019s discharge from hospital.\"\nThe pair found one of the major reasons for a delay in treatment was the blood sample \"journey\", including the transportation, analysis and checking of result took up to seven hours.\n\"It felt a bit too long and we were sure that it could be reduced,\" said Ms Forbes.\nShe explained a type of blood gas analysing equipment was already in use on the maternity unit but was not calibrated for analysing the bilirubin level in patients.\n\u201cFrom our earlier literature search, we found that some units did use this type of machine in neonatal care, so we contacted our biochemist consultant and asked whether we could do this with our machine,\" Ms Forbes said.\n\u201cThey took away our idea for a couple of months to go through all the safety checks and procedures, and then gave us the green light to start the machine to analyse bilirubin levels, meaning babies can get those test results within minutes.\"\nShe added: \u201cThis is a real game changer in the care of neonatal babies, as their treatment is not only much more efficient, but they\u2019re not jaundice for so long, meaning they\u2019re less likely to experience any complications.\n\u201cWe reviewed the care of two different babies with the same level of jaundice and found that the baby who had their tests done on the blood gas analyser stayed in hospital for 16 hours less.\u201d\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

I think there could be loads of little hot spots where new people could come in and have pop ups.\"\nMr Crowcroft said there had been pop up stalls supporting \"local charities and to enable schools to run their highly successful programmes enabling our young people too practise making and selling goods\". \n\"Pop up opportunities will continue to be sought both in the market and in the rest of town,\" he said.\nManger Romano at Relish Delicatessen has been operating within the market for two and a half years.\nThe shop sells a range of European cheeses, wines, charcuterie and chocolate.\nHe said working in the market was \"brilliant\". \n\"It's absolutely enjoyable and having a lot of tourists at the moment it's really nice to communicate with people,\" he said.\nRomano said to improve the market, it could be redecorated.\n\"I think it's important that the market is getting lighter and brighter because it looks really dreary and dark - winter time it's really bad, during the summer we have the sun coming in but I think it's important that we lighten up the whole market to make us frankly more welcoming,\" he said.\nMr Crowcroft said a \"great deal of research\" had been done regarding large scale improvements.\nHe said: \"My personal view is that an evolutionary approach is to be preferred not only because money is tight but also because our central markets are already extremely successful and I would be disappointed if improvement proposals led to some traders finding their existing businesses difficult to manage. \n\"Some relatively low cost improvements are already in train including attention to the roof and the lighting.\"\nOn top of remaining open in the evenings and introducing new stall owners, the market now remains open on a Thursday afternoon.\nIt used to close so staff could have a break, but in the government's Jersey Markets Strategic Review, it said this made \"little sense given that this is one of the busiest days of the week in St Helier\".\nMr Crowcroft said: \"After so many years of Thursday afternoon closure it is clearly going to take a lot of work to change that situation.\n\"The market manager has also introduced late night openings for a couple of restaurants in the market on Fridays and Saturdays and these are proving successful.\n\"There is clearly more that we can do to animate the markets in the evenings - at the same time the practical needs of almost 40 tenants in the market need to be kept in mind in orde",
    "A man who killed a pet rabbit after claiming the animal had bitten him has been given a suspended prison sentence and banned from keeping animals for 10 years.\nAndrew West was caught on a hidden camera at a house in Sheffield picking up the grey lop-eared rabbit by his neck and forcefully throwing the animal down towards the ground.\nThe city's magistrates court heard that the 30-year-old was interviewed by the RSPCA and immediately admitted the offence. In mitigation they were told he suffered from severe ADHD and had not not taking his medication at the time.\nA vet said it was \"one of the most disturbing cases of violence\" he had seen.\nThe upsetting footage, which was captured from the bedroom of a house in Adrian Crescent in Sheffield on 29 August 2023, was passed to the RSPCA which then launched an investigation.\nAt a sentencing hearing, Sheffield Magistrates' Court heard that RSPCA officers, accompanied by police, had gone to the property on 31 August last year after several video clips had been passed to the charity. \nIn one of them West can be seen grabbing the pet named Milo, and saying to him, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to hurt me again, do you understand?\u201d\nFurther footage showed the rabbit, which didn\u2019t belong to him, being flung on the floor by West before being found dead a short time later.\nThe court heard that when he was asked by the RSPCA why he was heard in one of the video clips saying, \u201cOh yeah you're going to get it,\" he said this meant he wanted to hurt Milo because he was angry with the rabbit for biting him, but he had not intended to kill it.\nIn mitigation two references provided to the court attested to his \"kind personality\" and \"love of animals\".\nAt a sentencing hearing at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on 26 July, he was handed an 18-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. \nA post-mortem report indicated the rabbit had been suffering from a brain infection called E cuniculi, a common infection in rabbits which can, in some cases, lead to seizures or death.\nA vet who viewed the video footage and gave written evidence in the case, said: \u201cRegardless of the post-mortem findings we can safely say that the individual in the footage was extremely cruel and violent towards Milo.\n\"Through his callous actions he has blatantly caused a great deal of pain, stress, fear and unnecessary suffering. \n\"This is one of the most disturbing cases of violence towards a helpless animal that I have had the misfortune to witness.\u201d",

    "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended a trip to Saudi Arabia, saying \"the widest coalition\" is needed to end reliance on Russian oil and gas.\nBut maintaining close ties with the Gulf kingdom is controversial among critics of its human rights record.\nThe US, UK and EU have announced that they will buy less Russian oil and gas, because of its invasion of Ukraine. However, prices have rocketed.\nSaudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec and has the spare capacity to help lower prices by increasing supplies.\nIt means Western countries need its goodwill and to keep on friendly terms with its ruling family.  \nSaudi Arabia is among the countries carrying out the most executions.\nIn March it executed 81 men in a single day - more than during the whole of last year. They were convicted of \"multiple heinous crimes\", including terrorism, kidnapping and rape, state news agency SPA said.\nRights organisations say many do not receive fair trials in Saudi Arabia, an allegation the government rejects.\nSaudi Arabia's international standing was severely damaged by the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Saudi journalist who was a prominent critic of the government.\nUN-appointed human rights expert Agnes Callamard said Saudi agents had \"used state means to execute Mr Khashoggi\" at its Istanbul consulate.\nSaudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and other senior officials were incriminated. Although the crown prince denied any involvement, his reputation was badly tarnished. \nAfter the kingdom's Public Investment Fund was allowed to buy an 80% stake in Newcastle United, Mr Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, called the takeover \"heart-breaking\".\nOVERVIEW: The other companies owned by Newcastle's buyers\nIn 2018, Saudi authorities arrested 13 women's rights activists who had led a campaign to lift a ban on women driving.\nAt least four of the women were allegedly tortured and sexually harassed by interrogators.\nIn 2020, a terrorism tribunal found the most prominent activist, Loujain al-Hathloul, guilty of crimes against the state. \nAfter the original sentence was upheld at an appeal, Amnesty International's Lynn Maalouf said: \"By failing to quash Loujain al-Hathloul's conviction, the Saudi Arabian authorities have clearly demonstrated that they consider peaceful activism a crime.\" \nWomen's rights activists have not been the only people detained as part of a crackdown against critics in Saudi Arabia, where political parties, trade unions and independent human rights groups are banned. \nDozens of human rights defenders, intellectuals, academics, clerics and reformists have also been arrested since 2017, merely for exercising their right to freedom of expression, according to international human rights organisations. \nMany have faced what Amnesty International has said were grossly unfair trials on vague terrorism and cybercrime charges, and received harsh sentences, including the death penalty. \nDays before the Newcastle United takeover, a court upheld a 20-year prison sentence handed to Saudi-American aid worker Abdul Rahman al-Sadhan for writing satirical tweets criticising the authorities.\nHis sister, Areej, said he was \"brutally tortured\" before his conviction.\nSaudi Arabia has been heavily criticised for a military campaign in neighbouring Yemen that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe.\nA Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 after Yemeni rebels seized control of much of the west of the country and forced the president to flee abroad.\nMore than 100,000 people have reportedly been killed in the fighting.\nTens of thousands are also estimated to have died from indirect causes, such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure. A partial blockade by the coalition has hampered efforts to help the 20 million people in need of humanitarian aid.\nUN experts say both sides in the conflict may have committed war crimes, though the coalition has insisted it is abiding by the rules of war.\nAlthough Saudi Arabia has no laws regarding sexual orientation or gender identity, sexual relations outside marriage, including homosexual sex, are strictly prohibited. \nUnder the country's interpretation of Islamic law, the death penalty is a possible punishment for same-sex sexual conduct. \nIt is also illegal for men to \"behave like women\" or to wear women's clothes, and vice versa.\nAn anti-cybercrime law criminalises online activity that goes against public order and religious morals.\nIn July 2020, a court sentenced a Yemeni blogger to 10 months in prison and then deportation for posting a video calling for equal rights, including for gay people.",
    "Kamala Harris's vice-presidential pick Tim Walz has drawn attention halfway across the world in China.\nChinese social media users have been discussing how Mr Walz spent a year teaching in the south-eastern province of Guangdong in 1989 - a topic that was trending on Weibo with 12 million views.\nHe and his wife, fellow teacher Gwen Whipple, later honeymooned in the country.\nMr Walz once described his decision to teach in China as \"one of the best things I've ever done\".\nThe 60-year-old Minnesota governor was a history teacher and football coach before he joined politics.\nHe was fresh out of college when he moved to China to teach English and American history at a high school.\nThe fact that it happened in 1989 - the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre - was not lost on those commenting on Chinese social media.\nOn 4 June that year, Chinese tanks rolled into Beijing's central square, where hundreds of thousands had gathered demanding political reforms. The day ended in bloodshed and to this day it is unclear exactly how many died. Some estimates put the death toll upwards of 10,000.\nChinese social media users cannot say much about 1989 or risk getting censored. They refer to it obliquely - one comment simply said \"If you know, you know\".\nForeigners who were in China at that time \"are the most anti-China\", said one user.\nOthers pointed out that China in 1989 was a vastly different country. It was well before China became the world's largest manufacturing hub, then its second-largest economy and finally, a powerful US rival.\n\"This candidate was in China at a very different time. The atmosphere was very different,\" one comment read.\nAnd yet they hoped that if he wins, he may signal better US-China ties. The two countries have been at loggerheads on trade, advanced technology, and China's geopolitical ambitions.\nOne Weibo user pointed out that Mr Walz's \"unique background gives him a real perspective on China\", and he could \"promote cultural exchanges between China and the United States at a time when... relations are extremely difficult\".\nBack then, Mr Walz spent a year teaching at the Foshan No 1 High School under a Harvard University volunteer programme. \nWhen he returned to the US, he told a local newspaper that there were \"no limits\" on what the Chinese could accomplish \"if they had proper leadership\".\n\"They are such kind, generous, capable people,\" he said.\nMr Walz and his wife were married on 4 June 1994 - the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen uprising. She said in an interview that \"he wanted to have a date he'll always remember\".\nThe couple then started a business which organised summer educational trips to China for US students.\nThere hasn't been much official reaction yet from the Republicans to Mr Walz's time in China.\nBut some allies of Trump have said Mr Walz's nomination would be welcomed in China, although Beijing has not commented on it.\n\"Communist China is very happy with @GovTimWalz as Kamala\u2019s VP pick,\" Richard Grenell, a former acting director of National Intelligence in the previous Trump administration, said on X.",
    "The operators of a landfill site which caused an \"eggy\" stench that left nearby residents feeling sick have applied to deal with more waste.\nWaste firm Valencia has bid for permission to process more recyclable waste at the Pilsworth Road site, which lies on the border of Bury and Rochdale in Greater Manchester.\nAn odour compared to that of rotten meat had emanated from the site for months, which led to the Environment Agency (EA) to be called to monitor the situation after the complaints of residents.\nA spokesman for Valencia said the firm had applied to the agency for a permit to process material via a new recycling facility.\nThe stench, known as the Pilsworth stink, had prompted concern from local authorities, including calls for Valencia to be stripped of its licence. \nNew monitoring facilities were put in place by the EA around the site as a result, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. \nThe operator agreed to stop accepting waste after a meeting with the agency earlier this year, and has carried out engineering work to try and tackle any odour.\nValencia was separately granted permission for a new recycling centre at the site, just to the east of the M66 motorway, in December last year.\nThe firm has now applied to start processing the material already coming into the landfill at the new facility.\n\"This is a significant investment in recycling infrastructure and will see any recyclable material removed and sent for reprocessing before residual waste is landfilled at the existing site,\" a spokesman said. \nAn Environment Agency spokeswoman said the bid was being considered as work continued to \"minimise the odour impacts\" from the landfill.\nOfficers have been carrying out regular inspections and monitoring to improve the situation, including air quality testing using a mobile monitoring facility, she said.\nA public consultation over Valencia's permit application is available to view online, where people can make comments until 23 August, she added.\nLocal resident Bernard Hirst from Unsworth said he and other residents were opposed to the firm's plans.\nHe said he feared Valencia would not meet its permit conditions, and said the EA's monitoring work should be allowed to finish before any further permissions are granted. \nMr Hirst told BBC Radio Manchester he could still smell the odour from the site \"on most days\".",
    "An Olympic bronze medallist who had a last-minute call-up to join Team GB said it was \"pretty insane\" to take her place on the podium in Paris.\nEquestrian Becky Moody, of Penistone in Barnsley, was a replacement for Charlotte Dujardin, who pulled out of the games over \"horse welfare\" issues.\nMoody said joining the dressage team at the eleventh hour meant she did not have time to get herself \"into a stress\" about competing.\nThe 44-year-old told the BBC: \"I was already prepped and ready to stand in if needs be, but it's quite a big change to go from being ready to actually doing it.\"\nMoody joined seven-time Olympian Carl Hester and Lottie Fry to score a combined 232.492% at Chateau de Versailles, winning a bronze medal.\n\"It's pretty insane,\" she told BBC Radio Sheffield.\n\"It's such an epic team effort to get one of these and I'm lucky enough to be the one who gets to wear it, so many people have been a part of this journey.\"\nIt came less than two weeks after Dujardin, the star of British dressage, withdrew on the eve of the games and was provisionally suspended by equestrian's world governing body after footage emerged of her \"excessively\" whipping a horse.\n\"In a lot of ways, the fact I came into it at the last minute was perhaps the best thing that could have happened to me because I didn't have time to spend weeks getting myself into a stress about it,\" she said.\nThe debutant was full of praise for her horse Jagerbomb and her support team who helped get them both ready for the games.\nA surprise party was held last week when they returned from Paris, with her drinking \"the odd Jagerbomb, maybe one or two\", she laughed.\nMoody said she was one of the older athletes competing at the Olympics but felt in dressage \"the older you get, the more experience you have\".\n\"Hopefully we've got a few more [games] left in us,\" she said.\nThe horses at the Olympics \"had the best accommodation\" out of all the competitors with air conditioning in their stables.\n\"It was almost a relief to go to the stables.

    "People attending a major concert criticised organisers after queuing for several hours in hot weather to get in, causing some to faint.\nThousands of people attended Bludfest, headlined by Yungblud, at the National Bowl, Milton Keynes, on Sunday.\nOne concertgoer told the BBC she passed out in the heat and never made it into the venue, while others said the long wait to get in caused them to miss several acts.\nFestival promoter AEG Presents apologised to fans who experienced delays and said the wait was down to \"heightened security measures\".  \nJessica Hedges, 21, of Northampton, told the BBC she and a friend had joined the queue at 12:45 BST ahead of gates opening at 13:00.\nThey had hoped to watch Nessa Barrett, who was on stage at 15:35, but by 16:15 they were still queuing \"and couldn't see the entrance\".\n\"Many people fainted; threw up. People went home and kids were overheating,\" she said.\n\"We had been begging for water and were told we'd get it once we were in the venue... I eventually passed out and never made it into the venue.\"\nShe said security staff were \"rude and showed no empathy\", adding: \"Four hours later, after sitting with paramedics for an hour, I am now home with heatstroke and didn't get in to see a single act.\"\nOther attendees posted on X, complaining of waiting in \u201cmassive queues\u201d with no water or shade and \u201cno information from staff\u201d.\nOne described the queues as an \"absolute farce\".\nJustin Dack, 50, of Dereham, Norfolk, told the BBC he was waiting with his wife, son and two friends for nearly three and a half hours.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been massive queues - lots of heat... people are overheating,\" he said.\n\u201cI do go to lots of concerts but have never had this experience.

    "It\u2019s a little told story in Scotland\u2019s music scene \u2013 the time a folk-rock band from East Kilbride opened for David Bowie\u2019s Ziggy Stardust tour in the 1970s.\nNow, decades on, a piece of the JSD band\u2019s legacy is coming to life \u2013 thanks to Leif Coffield, who is the great nephew of the group\u2019s former member, Des Coffield.\n'Only Fascination' is a song that was written by Des Coffield following the band\u2019s split.\nThe track lay hidden for 50 years until it was finally rediscovered.\nLeif was well aware of the song\u2019s legendary status within his family.\nHe said: \u201cI had heard of this song for as long as I can remember and it held some kind of mythical status in my family.\n\u201cWhen my dad was on holiday in the 80s, he would play the song to his pals and they were all raving about it.\n\u201cOn the last day of the holiday he told them \u2018you know that song we've been listening to... that's actually my uncle\u2019 and they couldn't believe it because it sounded like it would just fit perfectly on the radio at the time.\u201d\nHowever, the song was subsequently lost until its recent rediscovery during a clear-out of Des Coffield\u2019s belongings.\nUpon finding the tape, Leif was captivated by the track and was inspired to honour his uncle\u2019s musical legacy through a collaboration.\n\"It was almost criminal that it wasn't released at the time\", he said.\nPlans for this joint project were tragically cut short by Des' death to cancer last year.\nLeif was still determined to involve his great-uncle in his version of the song in some way.\nInspired by the way The Beatles used AI technology to include John Lennon's vocals in their 2023 song, \"Now & Then\", Leif decided he would merge Des' vocals with his own.\nHe said: \u201cI pulled my great uncle's original vocal from his demo and then just layered it in with my own vocals. \n\"So on the track you can subtly hear his vocals.\u201d\nLeif explained how he wanted to get some of his other family members involved too.\n\u201cThe remake includes my dad and cousin on guitar, my mum on cowbell, and myself on the production, guitar and vocals.\"\nLeif said he thinks his great-uncle Des would be happy with how the track turned out and hopes it brings a little piece of the JSD Band into the 21st century.\nEmerging from East Kilbride, the JSD Band had been an influential part of Scotland\u2019s music scene in the late 60s and early 70s.\nThe group was made up of five childhood friends and gained recognition for their electric-rock approach to traditional Scottish folk music.\nThey played on the club circuit with other Scottish artists such as Billy Connolly and Gerry Rafferty of the Humblebums, and Barbara Dickson.\nTheir talent let them to make appearances on BBC Radio 1 with DJ John Peel and they were the support act for the UK leg of David Bowie\u2019s Ziggy Stardust tour.\nFormer drummer of the JSD Band, Colin Finn, says the remake of \u2018Only Fascination\u2019 is good for Des\u2019s legacy.\nHe said of his friend: \u201cDes was a natural - a great songwriter, a great musician.\n\"He was a talented guy and I don't think he got the credit he really deserved.\n\u201cWe held him back!\"",
    "Tension in Venezuela is running high after a government-controlled electoral authority declared Nicol\u00e1s Maduro the winner of the presidential election and handed him a third consecutive term in office.\nNot only has the election been described as \"undemocratic\" by independent observers, but the result announced by the National Electoral Council (CNE) has also been dismissed as fraudulent by the opposition.\nThe European Union, the United States and a number of Latin American nations have refused to recognise the result, calling instead on the CNE to release detailed data from polling stations which the opposition says proves that its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, won by a wide margin.\nAnti-government protests have flared up and hundreds of people have been arrested by the security forces, which remain loyal to President Maduro. \nThose taking to the streets say they voted for change after a quarter of a century in which Venezuela has been governed by the socialist PSUV party - first under the leadership of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, then after his death in 2013 by his right-hand man, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\nDuring this time, their party has gained control of key institutions, including the CNE, the Supreme Court and much of the judiciary.\nAs a result, the role of the president has become much more powerful and the system of checks and balances has been severely weakened. \nNot long after Mr Maduro was elected for the first time in 2011, global oil prices plummeted and Venezuela - which relies almost entirely on oil revenue for its income - went into a seven-year recession. Inflation skyrocketed and shortages of basic goods became widespread.\nWaves of anti-government protests in 2014 and 2017 fizzled out after a police crackdown. \nMillions of Venezuelans left the country to escape economic hardship and political repression. Amid growing discontent, Mr Maduro was re-elected in 2018 in a presidential election widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.   \nVenezuela's divided opposition in January 2019 united behind the only major institution where they were still influential: the National Assembly and its speaker, Juan Guaid\u00f3. \nWith the backing of the National Assembly, Mr Guaid\u00f3 declared himself \"interim president\". And while more than 50 countries recognised Mr Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's legitimate leader, the military stayed loyal to Mr Maduro and - with the continued support of China and Russia - he remained firmly in charge of the country. \nShortages eased after Mr Maduro relaxed some of the strict foreign currency regulations brought in by Ch\u00e1vez.\nHowever, extreme poverty remains shockingly high and has contributed to more than 7.7 million people leaving Venezuela to seek better lives abroad.\nDisillusioned with the failure of Mr Guaid\u00f3 to seize control, the majority of opposition parties dissolved his \"interim government\" in December 2022.\nIn October 2023, they organised a primary to choose a unity candidate to take on Mr Maduro in the presidential election on 28 July 2024.\nFormer lawmaker Mar\u00eda Corina Machado won it by a landslide, despite having been banned by the comptroller-general, an ally of President Maduro, from holding public office.\nAfter her appeal against the ban was rejected, she threw her weight behind ex-diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the unity candidate to take on President Maduro in the presidential election on 28 July. \nOpinion polls gave Mr Gonz\u00e1lez a wide lead over Mr Maduro going into the polls. \nFearing fraud, the opposition deployed thousands of people as witnesses and observers. \nCopies of the voting tallies they provided - which have been uploaded to the internet and independently reviewed -suggest Mr Gonz\u00e1lez has won the election by a wide margin.\nThe Maduro government, however, insists that the result announced by the CNE, which is stacked with its allies, is the only valid one and has accused the opposition of incitement. \nIt has cracked down on the anti-government protests which have broken out, with the defence minister branding the marches \"a coup\".

    "A new 'living mural' at the home of an Irish league premiership team is bringing more than just a splash of colour to the grounds.\nCliftonville Football Club in north Belfast is offering a new home to endangered house martins.\nTheir numbers are in decline across the UK and Ireland partly due to a lack of suitable nesting sites.\nNesting cups have been incorporated into the mural at one of the stands in the club's Solitude stadium. These cups mimic the mud nests that house martins create for their broods.  \nThe Solitude stadium sits next to the Waterworks, which conservationists describe as an important site for a variety of species.\nIt's the first instalment of Safari in the City, a project which hopes to combine art and conservation in Belfast's urban environment. \nBetween now and the end of October, there will be a number of other murals popping up in different locations in the Belfast City Council area which will target the conservation of a variety of other native species including swifts, bats and invertebrates.\nMurals have always had a message in Northern Ireland but this initiative brings a new dimension to Belfast's mural history. \nConor McKinney and Perla Mansour of WildBelfast are leading the project, and say they are trying to build on the recent resurgence of public art in the city.\n\"The artwork itself is celebrating the species and the fact that it is there. The hope is to highlight that the Waterworks is an important place for house martins.\n\"We also wanted to show how easy it is to make conservation interventions using the blank canvases of the walls in our city,\" Mr McKinney added. \nEcologists, artists and members of the community collaborated to establish which species are endangered in a particular area.\nAlasdair McKee from the RSPB said since 1969 \"we have lost around 60% of our house martins in the UK and that decline is continuing\".\n\"In 2020 they were added to the red list of species of most concern and in need of urgent action to protect them,\" he said.\n\"House martins have been our close neighbours for centuries and are a part of our heritage,\" he added. \nItalian artist Daniela Balmaverde said that one of the main inspirations for the piece was the Cliftonville women's team. \n\"The club really seem to care about the environment and the surrounding community, so there is the caring element of the woman seen holding the nest to symbolise this,\" she said. \n\"We, as the artists, are working closely with ecologists and the community, running workshops as well, to ensure each piece is integrated in each location.\" \nClub member Joe Gallagher said the club, the current Irish Cup holders, had a vision.\n\"This is a quirky and unusual thing that came along whereby we can have a positive impact on the surrounding environment. \n\"We would love to see other areas of these grounds developed not only as stands but to incorporate other facilities that the community could use.\"\nMr Gallagher said that he believes the mural represents the \"liberal and welcoming views\" of the club. \n\"I was shocked to realise that house martins are an endangered species, and I think it's wonderful that the club can do something positive and be a model for what other people could be doing,\" he added. \nWhen the nesting season comes around in the spring, the birds coming to utilise the nesting sites will not be the first house martins to pay a visit to Solitude. \nPaul Heaton, lead singer of the English indie rock group The Housemartins is a well-known Cliftonville fan.\nHe has visited the club in the past to meet Celtic legend Danny McGrain and Cliftonville's George McMullan.",
    "A fisherman from Devon has landed the first shark of its kind - one made of Lego lost at sea off a cargo ship 27 years ago.\nRichard West, a 35-year-old fisherman living in Plymouth, found the plastic toy on the top of his fishing nets 20 miles (32km) south of Penzance on Tuesday.\nHe contacted the project Lego Lost at Sea, whose founder Tracey Williams confirmed the piece to be the first-ever reported shark from the 51,800 Lego sharks lost off the Tokio Express cargo ship on 13 February 1997.\nA freak wave in a severe gale swept 62 shipping containers into the sea 20 miles (32km) off Land's End, one of which held 4,756,940 pieces of Lego, much of it sea-themed.\nMr West was trawling on board the Defiant FY848, which sails between Plymouth, Brixham and Newlyn, for monkfish, sole and doreys, when he landed his unique catch.\nHe said: \"I could tell straight away what it was because I had Lego sharks in the pirate ship set when I was little. I loved them.\n\"It's been 25 years since I've seen that face.\"\nHe contacted Ms Williams who told him it was the first recorded Lego shark found from the spilled cargo that she had encountered.\nShe told him the official Lego inventory showed that 22,200 dark grey Lego sharks and 29,600 light grey ones were in the lost container. \nMr West said: \"I was so excited. I was more happy about finding the shark that anything else I caught this week.\n\"It's priceless - it's treasure!\"\nMs Williams said: \"This Lego shark is one of 51,800 lost overboard from the Tokio Express and the only one we\u2019ve ever seen.\n\"Richard and I now have joint custody of the shark.\"\nThe Lego sharks featured in several Lego sets from 1997, including Shark Cage Cove, Shark Attack and Deep Sea Bounty, she explained.\nShe asked anyone else who has found Lego from the spill to get in touch with the Lego Lost at Sea project so it could be added to the project's map, which is recording sightings for a scientific paper on the Lego spill.\nRecently Lego from the container lost overboard has been found not just in Cornwall but in the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, Wales and Ireland, she added.\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Somerset businessman and founder of the Mulberry fashion brand, Roger Saul, has put his personal collection up for auction on Wednesday.\nHandbags, belts, sunglasses, furniture and curtains are just some of the items up for grabs.\nMr Saul founded the brand at his kitchen table in 197, with \u00a3500 given to him for his 21st birthday by his Mother.\nHe said the process of finding items to auction has been \"really exciting\" and looking back has suddenly made him realise just what an \"amazing thing\" Mulberry has become and been.  \nMr Saul was born in 1950 in Lottisham, Somerset.\nHe moved to Midsomer Norton and attended Wells Cathedral School when he was 5-years-old, and later went to Kingswood boarding school in Bath. \nIn 1996, Mr Saul acquired Kilver Court in Shepton Mallet - initially using it as the headquarters for Mulberry before relocating the Mulberry factory shop from Chilcompton to the Old School House at Kilver Court. \nOver the years, the factory shop had become a well-known institution as one of the first designer factory shops in the country.\nAs the fashion brand grew, Mr Saul said that to make work more accessible for his employees - as many of them were young mums - he would encourage them to \"outwork\" and sew from home so that they could work and enjoy their family.\nHe said vans would go around \"collecting the bags\" from the workers' houses. \nMr Saul said: \"One thing that I tried to achieve with Mulberry was to make it aspirational as opposed to unobtainable - it didn't matter whether you could only afford the keyring or the purse.\"\nHe disputes that the brand is luxury and says he prefers to describe it as \"special\".\nWhen he left Mulberry, he said that he was concerned that the brand would head for \"luxury\" status which he says \"must've been sad\" for that previous generation who grew alongside him.\nMr Saul said he's been creating things for all his life and has always learned \"how to run them\" after.\nHe added: \"Finding items to auction has been really exciting and a great way to look back over the last 50 years - it's made me realise just what an amazing thing Mulberry has become and has been.\"",
    "A woman who has collected 163 bedpans of all different shapes and sizes is now hoping to sell them.\nMary Jacobs, 77, from Newmarket, started her collection in 1984 when she bought her first one for 50p in a jumble sale in the town. \nThe most she ever spent on one was \u00a318 and she has tried to auction them off before but, despite interest, failed to find a buyer.\nShe told BBC Radio Suffolk she wanted to ensure they were given to someone who would \"appreciate them\" as much as her.\n\"[My] children have got to get rid of them if I don't and I'd rather they go to a home or a museum that I know is going to appreciate them rather than just being [put in the] skip,\" Mrs Jacobs said. \nShe bought her first bedpan at the Newmarket Salvation Army jumble sale and little did she know she would end up with over 150 of them. \n\"I used to help out at the Salvation Army jumble sale and one came in that was different and I had never seen before,\" she said.\n\"I asked the captain if I could buy it and he said yes, so I actually bought it. That was the start of the vast collection I have now.\"\nMrs Jacobs said she was fascinated by the way the bedpans could be different shapes and sizes, and even have different coloured writing.\nSome in her collection have lids or spouts too. \n\"I was told by the auctioneers several years ago when I did enquire about selling them that it was a unique collection,\" she added. \n\"They had never, ever seen one like it before.\n\"I don't know of anybody who's got that many apart from a man in America.\"\nMrs Jacobs said she had \"plenty of interest\" when she tried to auction them off before but that \"people didn't want to actually pay any money for them\".\n\"The highest price for about one lot of 10 or 12 was \u00a310 and the auctioneer decided that wasn't realistic because he'd take his fees out and I'd be left with nothing,\" she said.\n\"So he disclaimed the bid and told me they were unsold and I had to pick them up.\"\nMrs Jacobs said she was \"disappointed\" but was still keen to try and sell them.\n\"If anybody's interested that would be great,\" she added.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Residents of a traffic-blighted village close to where a now-cancelled tunnel would have been constructed near Stonehenge say they are \"back to square one\".\nThe two-mile tunnel, which would have cost \u00a32bn, was cancelled by the government after a spending review.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves told the Commons last week that Transport Secretary had agreed not to \"move forward\" with the project.\nResident Sharon Paterson, who has lived in Shrewton for 27 years, said there were now \"a limited number of options for getting anywhere from this village\".\nPlanning permission for the tunnel, which was backed by Wiltshire Council and involved overhauling eight miles (12.8km) of the A303, was first approved in November 2020 - despite Planning Inspectorate officials saying it would cause \"permanent, irreversible harm\" to the area.\nHowever, National Highways said the tunnel would have reduced journey times, eased traffic problems and removed the road from the view of the landscape.\nThe plan has been controversial with locals spilt on the issue and there has been international interest, with UNESCO raising concerns about the World Heritage Site.\nMs Paterson added living in Shrewton was a strange experience with villagers able to leave easily one way - but not another.\n\"It is like being in the Bermuda Triangle, because if you want to go shopping somewhere it's probably easier to go to Warminster than it is to go east to Amesbury and Salisbury,\" she said.\n\"Salisbury would be a very good place to go, other than the fact it's very hard to cross the A303 now.\"\nAnother resident, Helen Woods, who has lived in Shrewton most of her life, said the traffic has \"easily\" got \"10 times\" worse in her time there.\n\"As locals we had a few rat runs which the public didn't know about, but now they've closed them we're all pushed onto the A303.\"\nShe added that traffic often goes \"a mile out of the village\".\n\"And sometimes it's another mile after that. So it could be two miles.\"\nShrewton taxi driver Steve Mackie said the traffic can get \"very bad\".\nHe blamed sat navs with live traffic information for diverting cars through villages.\nHe said in heavy traffic it was difficult to cross the A303 as drivers \"won't give in\" for fear of \"losing their place\" in the queue.\n\"I can't understand the mentality of them.\n\"Rather than let people through and free the traffic, they get so jealous and possessive and stressed out.\n\"It's just a joke, really. Something needs doing.\"\nCampaigner John Adams, from Save Stonehenge World Heritage Site, said: \"We think that all the agencies involved should get together and look at other intelligent alternatives.\n\"Not necessarily a whole road scheme, but there are things that could be done at both ends of the World Heritage Site and to stop rat-running through local villages.\"\nPaul McKernan, a Shrewton parish councillor of Shrewton, told the BBC: \"We routinely have traffic at a complete standstill through these very narrow roads as people's sat navs take them away from the A303. \n\"We don't even need an accident or a blockage now. The impact for the villages is that they can't use the high street - much of it doesn't have pavements.\n\"People tend to feel besieged.

    "Police in Austria have intensified security measures around the three Taylor Swift concerts taking place in Vienna on Thursday, Friday and Saturday this week.\nThe move follows the arrests on Wednesday of two people suspected of planning Islamist attacks on large events in the area around Vienna, including the concerts by the US superstar.\nThe General Director for Public Security, Franz Ruf, said a 19-year-old Austrian citizen was arrested on Wednesday morning in Ternitz in the province of Lower Austria. \nHe said a second arrest took place in Vienna in the afternoon, but gave no further details about the suspect.\n\u201cAccording to the current status of the investigation, the two suspects became radicalised via the internet,\u201d Mr Ruf said.

    "Farmers are counting the cost of the long, wet winter as they start to bring in record low harvests of grain.\nThe amount of wheat planted has fallen by nearly a tenth, and two thirds of British farmers say they have lost money.\nThroughout winter and spring many fields were waterlogged, crops that had been sown were lost and farmers couldn\u2019t get onto fields to sow anything.\nMike Wilkins, an arable farmer in Wiltshire, lost about half his wheat. He said: \u201cWe have lost thousands and thousands of pounds this year, it has been catastrophic.\u201d\nWhen I first met Mike Wilkins in May, he had a lake on his farm.\nHigh on the Marlborough Downs, you could see for miles around.\nBut where wheat should have stood, there were swans and ducks paddling around.\nOther fields were so wet the wheat sown had failed, rotting in the ground.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t make a loss it will be a miracle,\u201d he told me at the time.\nSince then, the sun has come out and what wheat they could sow now looks OK.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled,\u201d he says with a rueful smile. \u201cIt\u2019s thin and full of weeds we couldn\u2019t spray because the ground was so wet we couldn\u2019t get a tractor on.\u201d\nThe ears are golden now, and Mike picks a handful of grains to test for moisture.\nHe grinds them in a handheld device, which will tell him how moist the wheat still is.\n\u201cI need 15% max,\u201d he shows me.\n\u201cBut look \u2013 that\u2019s still 19%, way too high.\u201d\nJust then, it starts to drizzle again.\n\u201cWe need a few good solid sunny days to dry this, before we can cut it,\u201d he tells me, looking at the dark clouds overhead.\nIt is anxious, stressful work, but this is actually a normal West Country harvest routine.\nAugust is often wet, harvest always a tricky juggle.\nFarmers wait for the perfect weather window, then crank up the combine, whatever the day or the hour, to get the harvest home.\nBut this year is different. Even when they can get harvesting, much of the wheat never got sown in the first place.\nOn Mike\u2019s farm, as well as the lake they had several fields so waterlogged they missed the moment to plant wheat. Later, as they dried out, he got some beans in which will go for cattle feed.\n\u201cFinancially they will make hundreds and hundreds of pounds less per hectare,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cThis field is over 30 hectares, so that\u2019s thousands of pounds less profit.\n\u201cAnd we have 200 hectares more like this. It\u2019s been a really messy year.\u201d\nMr Wilkins, and his sister and parents who farm here, are far from alone.\nOfficial surveys from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board recently found the amount of wheat planted is 9% down, the lowest for 20 years. Oilseed Rape is 20% down.\nAt the National Farmers\u2019 Union, they\u2019ve reported their lowest ever farm confidence index. Some 65% of farmers say their incomes are down. 82% cited extreme weather as their biggest challenge.\nNFU President Tom Bradshaw said the results \u201cpaint a really stark picture\u201d.\n\u201cConfidence has collapsed after months of devastating flooding, unsustainably high production costs and low market returns, and against a backdrop of reduced farm support as we transition to a new Domestic Agriculture Policy and associated farm support,\" he says.\nIt was not just a wet winter, or a wet spring. Farmers had 18 months of rain, from September 2023 to May 2024 more rain fell than at any time since records began in 1836.\nAnd experts agree this is \"the new normal\".\n\u201cWe will get more extremes of weather,\u201d says Prof Nicola Cannon, of Cirencester\u2019s Royal Agricultural University.\n\u201cMore wet winters, more dry summers, more extremes. And our soils are unable to cope, because of the way we have farmed them in the past.\u201d\nTo see how farmers are now working differently, I revisit another farm that I last saw under water.\nDebbie Wilkins\u2019 farm had literally become a boating lake, her children kayaked on several miles of clear water which reached to the River Severn.\nBut she was philosophical about the hundreds of acres of pasture sitting under two metres of flood waters.\n\u201cThey are just doing their job,\u201d she told me in January.\n\"It takes the pressure off the river and protects the properties below us.\u201d\nNow, the grasses have come back. She shows me ancient wild grasses and flowers that have withstand long cold months under water.\n\u201cIt\u2019s green again, after six months of flooding,\u201d she smiles.\nBut the length of the flood has cost her money. Normally, the grass would bounce back in the spring and they would cut 600 bales of hay from these meadows.\n\u201cWe still haven\u2019t taken a hay cut this year,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we\u2019ll do well to get 150 bales.\u201d\nMs Wilkins is part of a new movement called \u201cNature Friendly Farming\u201d.

    "The first doctors to be trained at Lincoln Medical School have started working in the NHS.\nWhen the school took in its first batch of students in 2019, it was hoped it would solve the problem of attracting doctors to work in Lincolnshire.\nGraduate Dr Miranda Ntorinkansah, 24, joined Lincoln County Hospital last week.\nShe said there were many factors for staying, including her \"love for the city\" and its affordability. \n\"I thought to myself, I'm not sure why I would rush back to London when I've got everything I need here.\"\nDr Ntorinkansah grew up in South London and only moved to Lincoln because she did not get a place at her first-choice medical school and went through clearing. \nShe said: \"It honestly wasn't something I'd planned, but I think the best things in life happen that way.\"\nIn July, Dr Ntorinkansah became one of the first 73 doctors to graduate from Lincoln Medical School. \n\nLast week, she started her foundation training, working in Lincoln County's cardiology department.\nShe said it was unlikely she would have joined United Lincolnshire Hospitals as a junior doctor if she had not studied in the county, but expects it to offer opportunities for hands-on training she would have been unlikely to get at inner-city teaching hospitals.\n\"Hospitals like Lincoln and Boston will help you gain independent skills quite early on, compared to tertiary centres.\"\n\"Rural medicine is not something you get to experience often, especially if you grow up or work in a big city, so we get to see different conditions that are more progressed, like diabetes and hypertension, that are common across the country.\"\nLincolnshire was the largest English county without a medical school until Lincoln Medical School was established in 2018. \nIts first cohort of students joined in 2019 and, when they graduated last month, a handful stayed to work in the county.\nColin Farquharson, the group chief medical officer for Lincolnshire Community and Hospitals NHS Group, said he was hopeful that number would grow in coming years.\n\"It's always been a bit of a challenge historically to be able to bring students to train in Lincolnshire,\" he said. \n\"Essentially, we want to be able to grow our own doctors in the region and to give those students a really good, helpful experience while they're here [the medical school], so they then want to stay in the area and provide care to the patients and people that live in Lincolnshire.\"\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "A woman died from malnutrition due to severe chronic fatigue syndrome, a coroner has concluded. \nMaeve Boothby-O\u2019Neill suffered with severe myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) for a decade before she died at home in Exeter in October 2021.\nSarah Boothby previously said her daughter's death was \"wholly preventable\" and that her local hospital failed in its duty of care - claims the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust denied.\nFollowing a 10-day inquest, Deborah Archer, the assistant coroner for Exeter, Plymouth, South Devon and Torbay, said the 27-year-old had died from natural causes \"because of ME\".\nThe inquest heard Miss Boothby-O\u2019Neill had suffered from fatigue since the age of 13, which became worse after she completed her A-levels.\nIt was told she had been admitted to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital three times in 2021 for treatment for malnutrition.\nA nasogastric tube had been removed due to her vomiting while she was not considered suitable for total parenteral nutrition feeding.\nDoctors said they did all they could to help Miss Boothby-O'Neill, who had mental capacity and wished to be treated at home - trying to persuade her to stay at the hospital.\nIn the last few months of her life, Miss Boothby-O'Neill was unable to chew food and had difficulty drinking because she was not able to sit up.\nThe coroner said a named healthcare professional should have been appointed to co-ordinate her care as soon as it was realised she required hospital admission.\nMs Archer said with the \"benefits of hindsight\", had medics known she would \"deteriorate to the point of not being able to tolerate food or drink at all\", an earlier feeding tube may have been given to her. \nIn her conclusion, the coroner said: \"Whether this would have made a material difference to the outcome I cannot say. \n\"The disease for which there is no cure was not allowing her to take food and drink however administered, and the outcome may have been the same whatever the treatment given.\n\"For these reasons I cannot say these factors caused or contributed to her death.\"\nMs Archer said it was \"unrealistic\" for Miss Boothby-O'Neill to have been discharged home on the second occasion from hospital without a 24-hour care package in place.\n\"This factor did in my view contribute to her downward trajectory in the round but it was what Maeve and her mother wanted and wished for because Maeve could not tolerate the hospital environment,\" she said.\nMiss Boothby was her daughter's full-time carer and struggled to look after her on her own, the inquest heard.\nShe previously told the coroner it had been \"impossible for me to get enough calories into Maeve from a liquid diet\".\nMiss Boothby said: \"Maeve was starving to death. She knew it, I knew it, her father knew it, we knew it, the GP knew it.\n\"How the hospital did not recognise this as the inevitable outcome of inadequate hydration and nutrition must be for them to answer.\"\nRhys Hadden, representing the hospital trust, said his client did not accept all of Miss Boothby's evidence.\n\"The hospital does not consider that Maeve's death was preventable. It disagrees with the criticism that it failed its duty of care to Maeve or that there were missed or important opportunities.\"\nProf David Strain, who works at the trust, said he did not believe there was a \"ward anywhere in the country at the moment that can provide the sort of care that is needed\" for ME patients.\nThe inquest heard that Dr Willy Weir, an expert in ME, had written to the chief executive of the hospital a month before Miss Boothby-O\u2019Neill died about her case and the \"outdated\" views some doctors held about the disease.\nMs Archer told the court: \"In making the findings I have, I hope that important lessons for future treatment of ME can be learned from her death.\n\"No doubt with the benefit of hindsight things will be different in many respects.\"\nAndrew Gwynne, Minister for Public Health and Prevention, said it was a \"heart-wrenching example of a patient falling through the cracks\". \nHe said: \u201cMaeve and her family were forced to battle the disease alongside the healthcare system which repeatedly misunderstood and dismissed her.\n\u201cI am committed to improving the care and support for all those affected, and we intend to publish a final delivery plan this winter which will focus on boosting research, improving attitudes and education, and bettering the lives of people with this debilitating disease.\u201d\nA further hearing will take place on 27 September where the coroner will hear evidence about making a preventing future deaths report.\nThese are sent when a coroner thinks action is needed to protect lives.\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A Thai court has ordered the dissolution of the reformist party which won the most seats and votes in last year\u2019s election - but was blocked from forming a government. \nThe ruling also banned Move Forward's charismatic, young former leader Pita Limjaroenrat and 10 other senior figures from politics for 10 years.\nThe verdict from the Constitutional Court was expected, after its ruling in January that Move Forward\u2019s campaign promise to change royal defamation laws was unconstitutional.\nThe court had said changes to the notoriously harsh lese majeste law was tantamount to calling for the destruction of the constitutional monarchy.\nWednesday's verdict again serves as a stark reminder of how far unelected institutions are willing to go to preserve the power and status of the monarchy.\nBut the ruling does not mean an end to the reformist movement in Thai politics.\nThe surviving 143 Move Forward MPs are expected to transfer to another registered party and continue their role as the main opposition in parliament.\n\"A new journey has begun. Let\u2019s keep walking together, people,\" the party said in a message accompanied by a video on its social media platforms. \nChaithawat Tulathon, the leader of the opposition and one of the MPs barred from politics, stood up in the chamber and bid farewell to his colleagues, saying it was an \"honor\" to work with them. \nThis verdict \"may raise the question whether Thailand is a constitutional monarchy or an absolute monarchy\", said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University.\nHe said it was \"deja vu on one hand, and uncharted territory, on the other\". \nThis is more or less a repeat of what happened in 2020 when the then Future Forward Party, which had also done unexpectedly well in an election, was also dissolved, and transformed itself into the Move Forward Party.\nThat verdict four years ago ignited huge street protests, led by a new generation of student activists, which lasted for six months and voiced unprecedented demands for the monarchy to be made more accountable.\nThe authorities have since made extensive use of the lese majeste law to prosecute hundreds of protest leaders, including some Move Forward MPs.\nThe law has been widely criticised as stifling freedom of expression in Thailand, and in its manifesto Move Forward had proposed less severe punishments \u2013 jail sentences have been as high as 50 years \u2013 and a more rigorous process for filing charges.\nFears among reformists that Move Forward would not do as well in last year\u2019s election as Future Forward had in 2019 proved unfounded. \nThe party defied expectations to outperform every other party and become the largest in parliament, revealing a strong yearning for change among Thai voters.\nHowever, the military-appointed senate blocked Move Forward from forming a government over its lese majeste proposals, allowing a 11-party coalition of more conservative parties to take power instead.\nWith so many activists in jail, in exile or fighting criminal charges the large-scale protests seen back in 2020 are much less likely today.\nEven Move Forward\u2019s very mild proposals for a less severe lese majeste law have led to the party being stripped of its top leaders, just as its previous incarnation Future Forward was four years ago.\nAnd anyone thinking of organising protests similar to those four years ago will know that they too will be subjected to the tough penalties of lese majeste and several other sweeping laws in the Thai criminal code.\nThailand\u2019s constitutional court, which has dissolved 34 parties since 2006, has long been the principle guardian of the conservative status quo - at its heart is the monarchy, protected by a politically-assertive military. Beyond that, unaccountable power is wielded by palace officials, senior judges, business tycoons, and military and police officers.\nUnder the military-drafted constitution the senate has a decisive role in the appointment of constitutional court judges, and over the composition of other influential extra-parliamentary bodies like the Election Commission and the National Anti-Corruption Commission.\nThe previous senate was appointed by the military junta which ruled Thailand from 2014 to 2019, and rewrote the political landscape in which parties have to operate today. It played the central role in blocking Move Forward from forming a government.\nIt was unclear what to expect from the new senate this year - but the peculiar election system allows only those seeking a seat in the senate to vote for the candidates in several rounds. That, and some murky backroom dealing, have produced a new 200-seat senate, most of whom appear to be linked to a party known for its uncompromising loyalty to the monarchy.\nAdditonal reporting by Thanyarat Doksone in Bangkok",

    "It was 07:30 in the morning in late January when Khaled Ifranji received the phone call he had always feared. He had just passed through an Israeli military checkpoint on his way from his home in occupied East Jerusalem to his work in the occupied West Bank, when one of his employees rang to say the Israeli army was \"demolishing the stables\".\nKhaled had spent the last seven years building the Palestine Equestrian Club - pouring all his money and every waking hour into the project.\nThe club was built on West Bank land in the Palestinian territories, but in an area which is under full Israeli control.\nWhen Khaled arrived, it was a scene of destruction. There were four diggers demolishing everything.\nKhaled says his first concern was that there were still horses inside the stables. A video he shared with the BBC shows a digger striking a building while horses can be seen inside.\nWhen the horses were eventually released, they ran scared across the hillside. Khaled says one was hit by a car.\nKhaled asked the soldiers, \u201cWhy are you destroying my place?\u201d He says they ignored him. He told them they should be thanking him for the work he does with Palestinian children. \u201cI take away their anger\u2026There\u2019s no guns here. Just sport.\u201d\nThe Israeli army has confirmed to the BBC the demolition took place on 30 January but disputes Khaled's allegation that horses were still inside when it happened, despite the video evidence.\nThey said Israeli security forces and civil administration officials had \u201cremoved all the equipment from the compound and evacuated approximately 20 horses\u201d.\nThey also said the structures had been built illegally, but many Palestinians, like Khaled, say permits are impossible to obtain in this part of the West Bank.\nKhaled, who has ridden horses for nearly 30 years, was once a member of the Palestine Equestrian Team, and competed both locally and internationally.\n\u201cThere's a connection that can be established between you and horses, often deeper than those formed with humans,\u201d he says.\nAt the time of its demolition, the equestrian club was just beginning to reach a point Khaled was happy with. He and his team had built a watering system and many of the 30 horses had their own individual stables. They had constructed two arenas, a cafe and a toilet block and the centre was being powered by solar panels and was beginning to be profitable.\nOne of his younger clients - Shams - has been riding since she was six years old and training with Khaled for nine months now.\n\u201cThis place is home for me,\" she says. \"When I\u2019m riding Calypso I feel freedom. The second I ride on him every single stress I have is gone.\u201d\nWhen Shams\u2019 father told her that the centre had been demolished, she was terrified for Calypso.\n\u201cI was scared\u2026We have such a strong connection. He\u2019s my whole world.\u201d\nThe stables were built on a desolate hill a few kilometres south of Ramallah, the Palestinian administrative capital of the West Bank. It sits out on its own, not close to anything, a feeling of no-man\u2019s land.\nAs part of the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians in the 1990s, occupied West Bank land was split into three categories - Area A under full Palestinian control, Area B under partial Palestinian control and Area C under full Israeli control. \nKhaled's equestrian club is located in Area C, which makes up 60% of the West Bank. \nThis agreement was supposed to be temporary, but nearly 30 years later it seems to have cemented an Israeli presence.\nThe Israeli military continues to operate in all areas of the West Bank and settlements have expanded throughout the territory, something most of the international community considers an obstacle to peace and in contravention of international law. \nIn July, anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now revealed Israel had approved the advance of plans for 5,295 new homes in 12 West Bank settlements as well a seizure of 5 sq miles of West Bank land, making it one of the largest land seizures in 30 years.\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has said Israel should stop settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and end its \"illegal\" occupation of those areas and the Gaza Strip as soon as possible.\nThe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the court had made a \"decision of lies\".\n\nKhaled says Area C is the only place where there is enough space to build something like his club, away from built up areas of cities. Despite renting the land from the Palestinian ministry of religious affairs, he has been unable to get a permit to build as this is controlled by Israel.\nIn a statement to the BBC, a representative of Cogat, the military division that co-ordinates Israeli government activities in the occupied Palestinian territories, described the demolition of the centre as an \u201cenforcement operation\u2026 on a spot where an order forbade construction\u201d and that Khaled\u2019s buildings were in an area \u201cdesignated as an archaeological site\u201d.\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Human",

She has been granted bail and will be sentenced next month.\nThe girl was one of 14 people convicted on Tuesday for their part in the disorder that spread across parts of the UK following the fatal stabbings of three girls in Southport. Another eight people were jailed.\nAs of Monday, 975 arrests had been made and 546 charges had been brought in the wake of the unrest, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) said.\nOn Monday, two 12-year-old boys became the youngest to be convicted following the disorder.\nJohn Honey was convicted on Tuesday after looting stores in Hull, including cosmetics shop Lush where he was filmed walking around the store and filling a bag with products on 3 August. \nThe 25-year-old damaged nine vehicles during an attack on a garage and helped attack a car with three Romanian men in, forcing them to flee their vehicle.\nThe driver said he feared for his life after more than 100 \u201cangry\u201d men attempted to drag him from the car, punched him in the head and attempted to strike him with a metal bar. \nHoney was also part of a group outside a hotel known to house asylum seekers. He was captured on footage throwing a missile at police and pushing a large wheelie bin at them.\nHe pleaded guilty to violent disorder, three charges of burglary and racially aggravated criminal damage. \nThe court also heard Honey asked a prison probation officer if they wanted his autograph as he is \"famous and is all over social media\". His sentencing was adjourned until Friday. \nMeanwhile, a 19-year-old has been jailed for three years after throwing bricks and lit arrows at police guarding a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham. \nDrew Jarvis was told by a judge at Sheffield Crown Court: \u201cYour conduct was shameful and it was disgraceful.\"\nHe told the police after his arrest, he went to the hotel because \"they [asylum seekers] would be better off in their own country\u201d.\nJarvis admitted one count of violent disorder. \nAccording to BBC analysis, at least 120 people have been convicted so far. Of the more than 350 people charged, 201 have been charged with alleged violent disorder and 30 for allegedly assaulting an officer. \nAnd of the of 50 sentences passed, two years has been the average sentence handed down, with three years four months being the highest. \nFar-right protests and violence broke out in parts of the UK following the killing of three young girls in Southport. False claims spread online suggesting the suspect was an asylum seeker who arrived in Britain by boat. \nTory leadership hopeful Tom Tugendhat has criticised the government for not stopping the riots sooner with an \"overwhelming police presence\".\nBut Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has defended the government's response. \nShe told the BBC the government has responded \"robustly\" and \"playing politics as part of a leadership bid is not helpful on this\". \nMs Rayner added \"some of the challenges we face\" were \"because we've had 14 years of failure of the Conservatives\", and said the Tories \"should accept some responsibility for that\".

    "A cluster of Scottish islands could help solve one of our planet's greatest mysteries, scientists say.\nThe Garvellach islands off the west coast of Scotland are the best record of Earth entering its biggest ever ice age around 720 million years ago, researchers have discovered.\nThe big freeze, which covered nearly all the globe in two phases for 80 million years, is known as \"Snowball Earth\", after which the first animal life emerged.\nClues hidden in rocks about the freeze have been wiped out everywhere - except in the Garvellachs. Researchers hope the islands will tell us why Earth went into such an extreme icy state for so long and why it was necessary for complex life to emerge.\nLayers of rock can be thought of as pages of a history book \u2013 with each layer containing details of the Earth\u2019s condition in the distant past. \nBut the critical period leading up to Snowball Earth was thought to be missing because the rock layers were eroded by the big freeze.\u00a0\nNow a new study by researchers at University College, London, has revealed that the Garvellachs somehow escaped unscathed. It may be the only place on Earth to have a detailed record of how the Earth entered one of the most catastrophic periods in its history \u2013 as well as what happened when the first animal life emerged when the snowball thawed hundreds of millions of years ago.\nBack then Scotland was in a completely different place because the continents have moved over time. It was south of the Earth\u2019s equator and had a tropical climate, until it and the rest of the planet became engulfed in ice.\n\u201cWe capture that moment of entering an ice age in Scotland that is missing in all other localities in the world,\u201d Prof Graham Shields of University College London, who led the research, told BBC News.\n\u201cMillions of critical years are missing in other places because of glacial erosion \u2013 but it is all there in the layers of rock in the Garvellachs.\u201d \nThe islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland are uninhabited, apart from a team of scientists working out of the main island's solitary building, although there are also the ruins of a 6th Century Celtic monastery.\nThe breakthrough was made by Prof Shield\u2019s PhD student, Elias Rugen, whose results have been published in the Journal of the Geological Society of London. Elias is the first to date the rock layers and identify them as from the critical period that is missing from all other rock formations in all other parts of the world.\nHis discovery puts the Garvellachs in line for one of the biggest accolades in science: the golden spike hammered in at locations identified as the best record of planet-changing geological moments \u2013 though to ward off thieves the spike is not actually made of gold.\nElias has taken many of the judges of the golden spike, formally known as members of the \u201cCryogenian sub-commission\u201d, several times to the rock faces to press his case.\nThe next stage is to allow the wider geological community to voice any objections or to come up with a better candidate. If there are none, then the spike could be hammered in next year.\nThe prize would raise the scientific profile of the location and attract further research funding.\nIf it does earn the prize it would delight the man who first identified the significance of the formation as a young researcher 60 years ago, Dr Tony Spencer.\n\u201cThere are about fifty places in where we could choose for this golden spike,\"he told BBC News, \"but this is the one where the rocks are thickest and the sedimentation is the most continuous. \n\"So it appears to preserve the very earliest point in time when there is a record of this particular ice age.\u201d",
    "An Australian government review has found that \"serious failures\" by the Israeli military led to drone strikes on an aid convoy that killed seven workers in Gaza.\nThe strike on 1 April killed charity workers from the World Central Kitchen (WCK) from Australia, Canada, Poland, the UK and the US, as well as their Palestinian colleague.  \nThe review, released on Friday, concluded that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) failed to follow procedures and made identification and decision-making errors.\nForeign Minister Penny Wong said the Australian government would \"press for full accountability\" for those responsible for the incident, \"including any appropriate criminal charges\". \n\"The military advocate general of Israel is still to decide on further action,\" she said in a statement on Friday.\nThe IDF had launched an internal investigation amid intense international pressure and sacked senior officers after acknowledging that the strike was a \"serious failure\" and a \"grave mistake\". \nThe charity's team had been authorised by the Israeli military to help transfer aid supplies from the coast to a warehouse. The convoy was hit in the Gazan city of Deir al-Balah when drone operators did not follow rules and thought WCK's cars were carrying Hamas gunmen, the IDF's inquiry said.\nWCK founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s had accused Israeli forces of targeting his aid workers \"systematically, car by car\".\nWhile WCK recognised at the time that the IDF's admission of failure was an important step forward, it called for an independent investigation into the deadly attack.\n\"It is also clear from their preliminary investigation that the IDF has deployed deadly force without regard to its own protocols, chain of command and rules of engagement,\" WCK said in a statement in April.\n\"We demand the creation of an independent commission to investigate the killings of our WCK colleagues. The IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza.\"\nShortly after the attack, the Australian government appointed former defence force chief Mark Binskin as a special advisor on a review into the WCK workers' deaths.\nMs Wong said at the time that Mr Binskin would examine the \"sufficiency and appropriateness of the steps taken by the Israeli government\" in relation to the incident.\nFollowing the release of the review on Friday, Ms Wong said the Australian government would implement all of Mr Binskin's recommendations, including calls for Israel to improve coordination with humanitarian organisations working on the ground.\nThe IDF had also said that it had formally reprimanded three commanders for their overall responsibility in the strikes, and that those who carried out the attack could face criminal prosecution.\nMs Wong said Israel is still in the process of determining accountability. \n\"Our expectation remains that there be transparency about the military advocate general's process and decision,\" she added.\nMore than 250 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, according to the United Nations.",
    "India's stock market has been a hot topic of conversation for the past couple of days, with hashtags around it trending on social media.\nThe reason isn't just investor interest, but has more to do with its regulator. Let's break it down a bit.\nIt all started over the weekend when US-based activist-investor Hindenburg Research posted on X (formerly Twitter) that \"something big\" was coming. \nHours later, it released a report accusing Madhabi Puri Buch - the chief of market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) - of having links with offshore funds used by the controversial Adani group. Both Ms Buch and the Adanis have denied wrongdoing.\nNow, Hindenburg had last year accused the Adani group - founded by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani - of decades of \"brazen\" stock manipulation and accounting fraud. \nThe group - which has 10 publicly traded companies, operating across a wide range of sectors, including commodities trading, airports, utilities, ports and renewable energy - had strongly denied the allegations.\nBut the controversy took billions off its market value - it has since mostly recovered - and Sebi is still investigating the allegations.\nHindenburg now say that Ms Buch's links with the funds used by the Adanis have impacted the regulator's investigation. \nMs Buch has denied any conflict of interest and said that the investment was made before she was associated with the regulator. Also, there is no direct evidence so far linking her investment in the funds with Adani Group stocks or Sebi's investigation.\nThe fresh allegations wiped off $2.43bn (\u00a31.9bn) off Adani Group's market value at the end of trading on Monday, though it made a substantial recovery from losses earlier in the day.\nIn its report, Hindenburg referred to earlier articles by Financial Times and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project that linked obscure offshore funds in Bermuda and Mauritius to Mr Adani's business associates.\nHindenburg alleged that Ms Buch and her husband, Dhaval Buch, invested in these sub-funds in 2015.\nThe firm said that weeks before Ms Buch became a whole-time member of Sebi in 2017, her husband wrote to the fund administrator, asking to be made the only person \"authorised to operate the accounts\".\nThe report says Ms Buch used her personal email ID to write to a wealth management firm to seek the redemption of her husband's entire investment in the fund.\n\"We suspect Sebi\u2019s unwillingness to take meaningful action against suspect offshore shareholders in the Adani Group may stem from Chairperson Madhabi Buch\u2019s complicity in using the exact same funds used by Vinod Adani, brother of Gautam Adani,\" the firm alleged. \nHindenburg also flagged Ms Buch's husband becoming an adviser in 2019 for US investment manager Blackstone, which has invested in Indian real estate investment trusts. Pointing to regulatory changes made by Sebi during Ms Buch's tenure as member and chairperson, they alleged that it directly benefitted firms like Blackstone.\nMs Buch and her husband have said in a statement that the investments referred to in the Hindenburg report were made in 2015 when the couple were private citizens in Singapore, \"almost two years before Madhabi joined Sebi, even as a Whole Time Member\".\nThey said their investment was made because of Mr Buch's childhood friendship with the fund's then chief investment officer Anil Ahuja, who also \"had many decades of a strong investing career\".\n\"As confirmed by Mr Ahuja, the fund did not invest in any bond, equity or derivative of any Adani group company,\" their statement said.\nThe statement added that the market regulator had \"strong institutional mechanisms of disclosure and recusal norms\", which they had followed \"diligently\".\nIt called the Hindenburg report an attack on the \"credibility of Sebi\" and an attempt at \"character assassination of its chairperson\".\nRegarding the allegation about Mr Buch's role with Blackstone, the couple said the investment firm was part of Ms Buch's \"recusal list maintained with Sebi\".\nThe market regulator said in a statement that it had \"duly investigated\" Hindenburg's allegations against the Adani Group. \nIt also said that its chairperson had made the required disclosures in \"terms of holdings of securities and their transfers\", and that she had recused herself in matters involving \"potential conflicts of interest\".\nIn a statement released on its website on Sunday, the conglomerate called the allegations \"a recycling of discredited claims that have been thoroughly investigated [and] proven to be baseless\".\n\"Our overseas holding structure is fully transparent, with all relevant details disclosed regularly in numerous public documents,\" it said.\nThe group said Anil Ahuja had been a nominee director of its 3i investment fund in Adani Power in 2007-2008 and a director of Adani Enterprises until 2017.\n\"The Adani Group has absolutely no commercial relationship with the individuals or matters mentioned in this calculated deliberate",
    "Big increases in housing targets could disrupt work on a new planning roadmap for parts of Warwickshire, according to officials.\nStratford-on-Avon and Warwick districts could have to find room for 30% more new homes than anticipated.\nThe areas' district councillors were presented with the figures during an update on the emerging South Warwickshire Local Plan (SWLP).\nLeading officers from both authorities agreeing that new government proposals threaten to \u201cdrive a coach and horses\u201d through the work done so far.\nThe SWLP will set out how new housing is catered for and plan for where it will go through to 2050, bringing together two areas that do not currently have their own plans.\nThe plan has been three years in the making already and is not set to be finalised until December 2027, with officers currently in the process of nailing down housing numbers.\nStratford-on-Avon District Council is currently committed to 730 homes per year with Warwick District Council\u2019s at 1,098.\nThe joint plan has been working towards 868 new homes per year in Stratford district and 811 per year in Warwick district.\nHowever, the new government has launched a consultation on changes to national planning policies, aiming to speed up house-building with a focus on affordable homes.\nThe new method would be based on current housing stock levels rather than future projections of need in the hope of creating more stable growth across populated areas.\nThat will drive down the targets for bigger city areas like Coventry and Birmingham but pushes up the figure across the SWLP patch to 2,178 homes per year.\nThis is 1,098 across Stratford district and 1,080 across Warwick district, which is 499 more than the two councils had been working to.\nThe government\u2019s consultation on its potential changes to the National Planning Policy Framework concludes on 24 September.\nA public consultation is due on the SWLP\u2019s preferred options in November.\nStratford\u2019s head of development, John Careford said the council would need to do the \"number crunching\" to see what was available and what impact the increase in housing would have.\nWarwick\u2019s councillors expressed concerns but cast doubt on whether the national proposals will stay as they are.\nCouncillor Ian Davison, leader of Warwick District Council, said: \"It is not definite.\n\"My personal view is that you could say the Labour party is being brave, they are going from around 200,000 new homes per year to around 350,000.\n\u201cIf house building genuinely rockets to 350,000 per year the prices will absolutely rocket in terms of construction, technical people and so on.\n\u201cThen you need lots of people with lots of money to buy the houses, and we know that developers don\u2019t develop if the house prices and therefore the profits fall.\n\u201cI think it is extremely brave.

    "US transport safety officials investigating a mid-air emergency on a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane have released thousands of pages of documents, including testimony describing the \"chaos\" in the moments after the blowout of an unused door.\nIt came as a two-day National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) hearing about the 5 January incident on an Alaska Airlines flight got underway.\nDuring the event, Boeing told investigators it will introduce design changes to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\nThe blowout triggered the US aviation giant's second major crisis in recent years.\nIn the more than 3,000 pages of documents released ahead of the hearing, the plane's crew described the violent decompression that resulted from the panel detaching mid-flight.\nThe plane's co-pilot told the investigation there was a \"loud bang, ears popping, my head got pushed up into the [head-up display] and my headset got pushed, not off my head, but up almost off my head.\" \n\"It was chaos,\" they said.\n\"And then, just all of a sudden, there was just a really loud bang and lots of whooshing air, like the door burst open,\" a flight attendant said. \n\"Masks came down, I saw the galley curtain get sucked towards the cabin.\"\nThe names of the air crew have been redacted in the documents.\nAt the hearing, Boeing executives were grilled about the manufacture of the aircraft involved in the incident and the lack of paperwork explaining who carried out work on the door plug before the blowout.\nA preliminary report by the NTSB detailed how, after a repair at a Boeing facility, the panel had four bolts missing, which should have helped keep it in place.\n\"The safety culture needs a lot of work,\" said NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy, adding that the plane maker needs to take steps to address the issues.\n\"They are working on some design changes that will allow the door plug to not be closed if there's any issue until it's firmly secured,\" said Boeing's senior vice president for quality Elizabeth Lund.\nThe NTSB and Boeing have yet to find out who was responsible for removing and reinstalling the door plug.\nBut Ms Lund said two workers who are likely to have been involved are now on paid administrative leave.\nThe incident was the latest major blow to Boeing's reputation.\nIt resulted in the grounding of Max 9 planes around the world for two weeks, a ban on increasing production, a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe and a management shakeup.\nThe company recently said it would plead guilty to a fraud charge related to fatal crashes of two of its 737 Max planes more than five years ago.\nLast week, Boeing said it had lost $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) between April and June.\nIt has also named aerospace industry veteran and engineer Robert K 'Kelly' Ortberg as its next chief executive.",
    "Research is being carried out on why blue tits have been nesting in cigarette butt bins and if it could have any long-term impact on the birds.\nDouglas Russell, a senior curator who is based at the Natural History Museum (NHM) in Tring, Hertfordshire, is carrying out the study after more tits were reported to be nesting in the bins. \nThe phenomenon has been noted anecdotally for some 20 years, said Mr Russell, who recently recovered two bins from Old Buckenham, Norfolk, and Harrogate, Yorkshire, where the birds had fledged.\nTests would be carried out on the boxes and nests to find out more about any toxicity passed onto the birds, and to establish if the bins need redesigning to prevent tits from nesting in them.\nMr Russell said it had been a challenge to get to the bins before they were emptied. \n\u201cI\u2019ve tried for years to get examples of this. I think I\u2019ve been trying since 2007. Every time it\u2019s been too late. They get emptied or people won\u2019t cooperate,\u201d he said.\nThe nests that were collected in Norfolk and Yorkshire this July have been quarantined in a freezer, to prevent contamination to the museum's other collections.\nThey will now undergo scanning at the NHM in London.\n\"I am hoping to use the CT scanner to try and obtain a 3D model of the entire cigarette bins \u2013 this would, hopefully, allow us to describe the bins interior, including depth of nesting material, number of cigarettes etc,\" said Mr Russell.\nToxicology tests would also be carried out using swabs and samples of the interior of the bin, as the chicks and adults were exposed to this.\n\"We know there is at least one dead bird present in one of the bins \u2013 we may be able to remove some eggshell, feathers and tissues,\" continued Mr Russell.\nTests could demonstrate that beyond surface contamination, the birds have also absorbed the toxins, and that these may have been fatal.\n\"We would \u2013 I guess \u2013 expect the usual range of chemicals found in cigarettes and smoke (7,000+ chemicals) - including some 80 chemicals known to cause cancer,\" said Mr Russell.  \n\"However, I think the major toxins we will want to quantify are probably tar, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, benzene, cadmium, and nicotine.\"\nIronically, the existence of the chemicals would also mean the boxes were \u201cextremely low on ectoparasites which tend not to be present because of the nicotine\u201d, and something the nesting parents might seek.\nThe museum's curator believed the boxes were attractive to blue tits because they have small entrances, and tits like to make homes in tiny crevices to protect them from predators.\nThe bins were designed to ensure not too much oxygen enters the container, thereby reducing the risk of a nest or other material catching on fire.\nMr Russell said another possible reason why the bins were popular with the birds was the uptake in vaping, which meant fewer smokers were actually using the bins to deposit cigarette ends.\n\"So what cigarette box manufacturers are doing inadvertently, is creating a fantastic nesting box for birds,\" he said. \n\"What I am trying to do is demonstrate how this behaviour is highly dangerous to the birds, and we need to motivate for a change in the design of cigarette bins to stop the birds prospecting them and using them as nest sites,\" he said.\n\"The problem is this is seen as \u2018just a bit quirky and cute' \u2013 it isn\u2019t. \n\"It is a sad indictment of the quality of nest sites urban birds are using.\"\nMr Russell said the use of the cigarette bins potentially meant more purpose-built nest boxes were required in all areas, including urban locations adjacent to wooded areas, as was the case with the Old Buckenham boxes. \nThe research will also test a few other natural blue tit nests and the NHM said it had at least 20 uncontaminated blue tit nest specimens, collected over more than 130 years, for comparison.\nAccording to the British Trust for Ornithology the blue tit population has a green status meaning it is of least conservation concern.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Three petrol bombs were thrown at a Holiday Inn Express hotel in Tamworth on Sunday night, Staffordshire Police said.\nOne officer suffered a suspected broken arm in what the force described as \"targeted violence\", with projectiles and fireworks thrown from a \"hostile\" crowd.\nExtra officers were drafted in from neighbouring forces in order to deal with the incident - which ended after the crowd was \"successfully dispersed\", police said. \nAssistant Chief Constable Stuart Ellison referred to the violence as \"despicable thuggery\" and said officers in Tamworth had shown \"tremendous courage\". \nMr Ellison added: \"The local community do not deserve to be subject to this behaviour, and neither do the brave officers putting themselves in harm\u2019s way to keep everyone safe.\n\"We will be using footage from CCTV, air support and our officers\u2019 body-worn video devices to identify those responsible and seek the toughest possible punishment for these acts of senseless violence.\"\nNo one inside the Holiday Inn Express was injured, police said, but added that windows were smashed and petrol bombs were used to start a series of fires.\nIn July, Tamworth's MP Sarah Edwards told the House of Commons the Holiday Inn in the town had been \"used for asylum purposes for years\".\nA spokesperson for IHG, which owns the Holiday Inn Express brand, said: \"The safety and security of our guests and colleagues is always our priority.\"\nA similar incident took place in Rotherham on Sunday when anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of a Holiday Inn Express before starting fires.\nMeanwhile, violence in Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday went against everything the city represents, according to the leader of the city council.\nTen people were arrested and three police officers injured after hundreds of protesters gathered in Hanley in the wake of the Southport attacks, in which three girls were killed.\n\"We unequivocally condemn these protests and the violent behaviour associated with them,\" said councillor Jane Ashworth.\n\"Their message of division goes against everything we stand for in Stoke-on-Trent.\"\nTwo men were also treated in hospital after being struck by blunt objects that were thrown although their injuries were not believed to be serious.\n\"I'm furious, I'm horrified, I'm disappointed, we do not want this kind of thing going on in our city,\" said Ms Ashworth.\nShe said it was fortunate there had been little physical damage in the city centre, which was partly down to \"an extremely good job\" by the police, but many businesses had seen their trade affected after closing early due to the \"horrendous physical violence.\"\nThe council leader said she was expecting to see prison sentences \"and some heavy ones\" for those found to be responsible.\nAt least seven of those arrested are from the city or neighbouring Newcastle-under-Lyme.\nThey include 15 and 16-year-old boys accused of violent disorder or possessing offensive weapons as well as men arrested on suspicion of attacking emergency workers or racially or religiously aggravated harassment.\nIslamophobic chants could be heard on footage posted online during the day but there have also been accusations of  double standards from police.\nFootage shared online appeared to show an officer with a loud hailer addressing a group outside a mosque in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\"If there's any weapons, get rid of them, we are not going to arrest anybody,\" he appears to say.\nIn response, a spokesperson for Staffordshire Police said it recognised \"some edited footage\" shared on social media had \"gained traction\" and had an effect on public confidence. \n\"We\u2019re committed to fully investigating all of the material available, addressing any lessons to be learnt with proportionate action and continuing to reassure people in Stoke-on-Trent,\" they added.\nVideos shared on social media, along with police drone footage, were also being reviewed to identify those involved in the disorder, they added.\nAs well as the violence on the streets, police have also had to contend with misinformation spread on social media platforms.\nThe force said rumours of two men being stabbed on Saturday - perpetuated by videos shared online - were false. \nIt said no such stabbings were reported. \nA special prayer vigil was held on Saturday for \"peace and all people of goodwill to do what they can to encourage mutual respect,\" said Lloyd Cooke from Christian charity Saltbox.\nMr Cooke, who spoke on behalf of Stoke-on-Trent's Faith Leaders Forum following the protests in Stoke-on-Trent, said all faiths in the city were united in calling for peace and understanding.\n\"Ultimately, hate and violence will solve nothing,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

He's hoping August's interest rate cut is the first step to help him on to the property ladder.\nThe record store manager was among those who shared what impact interest rates are having on their lives.\n\"I stopped renting at the end of April as I realised I was only saving \u00a3100 a month,\" Mr Willicombe said.\n\"I had a chat with my parents and I thought the best thing to do was move back in for 12-18 months. I can save up to \u00a31,000 a month now and if I carried on renting I would still be saving for a place of my own into my 30s.\n\"I'm guessing such a small cut in interest rates isn't going to lead to mortgage rates plummeting but it's a step in the right direction and it hopefully gives lenders the confidence to offer better deals.\"\nHe said he hoped by the time he had saved his deposit, mortgage rates, which are influenced by the Bank of England's base rate, would be lower.\nMr Willicombe works as a manager at Kelly\u2019s records in Cardiff and said the cut in interest rates could also be good news for the store. \n\"If rates are lower there's less incentive to save so people might feel like they have more disposable income and be more willing to spend in the shop.\n\"We say in the store: 'Music is a form of escapism from day-to-day life.'

We are hoping to see an increase in footfall in our store.\"\nAnna-Marie Craven, 48, from Wales, said she put her detached cottage on the market after her mortgage rate more than doubled.\nShe is currently locked into a 4.8% mortgage, which rose from 2.2%, and is hoping to sell and downsize but is finding it hard to find a buyer.\n\"My husband was a serving police officer - when he died suddenly at the age of 51, I was left not only with a disabled little boy who at the time was 18 months old, but with the mortgage after the life insurance refused to pay out.\n\"I\u2019ve managed now for over six years renegotiating on low rates but I can\u2019t continue to pay on the new rate of 4.8%,\" she said.\nMs Craven said she hoped the Bank of England's rate cut would \"stimulate the housing market\" so she can finally find a buyer.\nNevertheless, she refers to herself as \"one of the lucky ones\".\n\"If I sell, I can then downsize and buy outright, but the housing market is tough right now,\" she said.\nHigh interest rates have not been bad for everyone, though. \nCarl Jones is a self-employed gardener who lives in Wiltshire and likes to have at least \u00a320,000 in savings at any point.\nHe calls this his \"zero\", and it's a mentality he has from growing up without much money. \nBecause interest rates are high, he said he had made around \u00a3100 a month from his savings.\n\"I've never had debt in my entire life,\" he said, though he understands that others are struggling because of high rates.\nThough the cut will reduce his earnings, Carl said \"it won't be a massive change\".\nHe said the period of high interest rates has been short, but it has still helped him to save a lot.\nRupali Wagh is a co-owner of Tukka Tuk street food in Cardiff. \u201cI have never had so many conversations [with customers] about mortgages and expenses,\u201d she said.\nThe interest rate cut has made her feel \u201chopeful\u201d as it will eventually lower the payments on her business loans and means some customers will have more disposable income.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small rate cut so I really do think it\u2019s a good start. At least we know they\u2019ve looked at it and said this is necessary.\u201d\nMs Wagh remortgaged another restaurant, Tukka Canteen, in order to reopen it last week.\n\u201cOur mortgages are on fixed rates so there won\u2019t be a change straight away. But for us and our directors, if our payments go down on our personal mortgages we will have a bit more money that we can invest back into the business.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got more hopes for customers' personal incomes because if I have no customers I have no business.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Gabrielle Sungailaite, Mitchell Labiak and Charlotte Edwards",
    "Anti-racism protesters have gathered across Scotland, with demonstrations taking place in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Dumfries. \nIt comes in response to violence across England and Northern Ireland fuelled by far-right and anti-immigration sentiment. \nThe unrest began following the fatal stabbing of three young girls at a dance class in Merseyside in the north of England. Misinformation online claimed an asylum seeker was responsible for the girls' murder. \nPolice said there was \u201cno intelligence\u201d to suggest there might be similar rioting in Scotland. \nOn Saturday morning, hundreds of demonstrators assembled outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. Many protesters were joined by their children and dogs.\nThere were chants of \"refugees are welcome here\". \nOne woman told the BBC: \"I'm here today to protest against the rise of right-wing thinking.\n\"We are not anti-immigration, we are not anti-migrant, we are anti-racist and I want to put all of those 'pro' feelings on the street.\"\nAnother said: \"I think everyone should be welcome here, it's not worth pointing a finger at your neighbour.\"\nThe chanting was also repeated in Glasgow's George Square, where hundreds of demonstrators were gathered. \nThere was a large police presence but the event was peaceful.\nAt one stage, officers separated two counter protesters from the anti-racism demonstration. \nOne man with a sign reading \"asylum frauds out\" and another with a megaphone were approached by a group of anti-racism protesters who shouted \"Nazi scum off our streets\" at them. \nA short time later, the pair left the square, escorted by a large group of police officers. \nOn the Planestanes in Dumfries, about 200 people turned up, some with placards showing messages of unity.  \nOne read: \"We are one people.\"\nThey listened to a series of speeches, with one speaker telling the crowd: \"This is not what we are in Dumfries.\" \nA demonstration also took place at City Square in Dundee. \nOutside the Caird Hall, the group held up signs condemning racism. \nOn Friday evening, about 150 people joined a Stand Up to Racism demonstration in Paisley and about 100 people gathered at a similar event in Bathgate, West Lothian.\nThe events were organised in response to rumours on social media that anti-immigration protests were being planned in the towns.\nHowever, there was no sign of far right protests.\nFirst Minister John Swinney said on Friday that \u201cadequate preparations\u201d were in place to deal with any flare-ups should they happen and Police Scotland had the resources to deal with any potential disorder. \nThe force is expected to send 120 officers to Northern Ireland next week to support the police service there, which has been dealing with a number of incidents of disorder. \nMr Swinney has also written to social media companies Meta, TikTok and X calling for \"immediate\" action to tackle misinformation and hateful material which has fuelled violent scenes across parts of the UK.",

One woman said: \"We are a strong, multi-cultural community and there's no place for fascists here.\"\nShe added: \"I was born in the general hospital and I've grown up here, I taught at Wingrove Primary School.\n\"This is my community.\"\n\nAmong the crowds was a young man who said he was there to show that a minority would not succeed in tarnishing the image of Newcastle as \"one of the best cities in the world\".\nHe added: \"I'm here to show solidarity for the people who feel afraid of the racists in this country.\n\"Wherever we\u2019re born, it\u2019s about where we are and the one thing we\u2019ve all got in common is we\u2019re living in Newcastle, so we\u2019re all Geordies.\n\"We\u2019re not for violence, we just want to show them they cannot come and do whatever they want and ruin our city.\"\nAnother man told the BBC he wanted to be present to show his support to the community.\nPeople held signs celebrating Newcastle's diverse community, with one saying \"Geordies are of all colours\" and another saying \"Newcastle loves black and white\".\nAhead of the gathering, viral social media posts had suggested some anti-immigration demonstrations could take place in cities and towns in the North East.\nIn response, Northumbria Police cancelled officers' rest days and told the public that \"every deployable officer in uniform is out in the community\". \nCh Supt Wykes urged people to get information from trusted news sources or by speaking to police officers.\n\"There is a lot of misinformation out there at the moment, in particular on social media,\" he said.\nLarge crowds also gathered in parts of Middlesbrough throughout the evening, including on Parliament Road and outside a mosque on Waterloo Road, in anticipation of further disorder following days of riots across the UK in the aftermath of the killing of three girls in Southport.\nCleveland Police said one man was arrested in the town after failing to comply with a request under special police powers to remove the face covering he was wearing \"to hide his identity\".\nAfter refusing to remove it, he was searched and also found to be carrying drugs and a weapon.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Thousands of people who gathered in the centre of Bristol have been thanked for their \"exemplary behaviour\" following a week of disruption. \nThe anti-racism demonstration was organised after it was rumoured an immigration lawyer's premises would be targeted by far-right protesters. \nBristol Police Cdr Supt Mark Runacres added that the vast majority of those on West Street had shown \"patience and generosity\" to his officers.\nHowever, one man was arrested after a brick was thrown at a police vehicle during the rally.\nIt was feared Bristol could see a repeat of Saturday's violent disorder, in which far-right protesters clashed with counter-protesters in the city centre and targeted a hotel housing asylum seekers. \nSeventeen people have been arrested so far in connection with Saturday's disorder, with three men since being charged. \nOf the anti-racism demonstration on Wednesday, Cdr Supt Runacres said: \"We know our communities were worried about what might happen but the vast majority of people displayed exemplary behaviour.\n\"I\u2019m extremely grateful for the assistance we\u2019ve had from community and business leaders both in the lead up to, and during, tonight\u2019s operation.

One caf\u00e9 brought out hot drinks which were hugely appreciated.\"\nHe added that there were no acts of violence or damage to the street or surrounding businesses, describing the throwing of the bottle and brick as \"the only disappointing moment we dealt with\". \nAbout 250 police officers were on duty as the crowds gathered, with a \"visible presence\" maintained through the night in the Old Market area. \n\u201cSome people did leave the Old Market area and head towards the city centre and at least one firework was set off in Castle Park but this group did not cause any significant issues,\" Cdr Supt Runacres added. \n\u201cPolicing operations like this are always challenging due to the huge number of people involved and so I\u2019m really pleased with how tonight\u2019s has gone,\" he said.\nSpeaking on Thursday morning as he took boards down from the front of one of his three shops on West Street, Essie Golshan said the protest had caused \"fear\" on Saturday, leading to him securing his windows and advising other shopkeepers to do the same. \nMr Golshan, who moved to the UK more than 40 years ago from Iran, said the area had been \"a ghost town\" on Wednesday, but said Bristol was \"one of the great cities\" and \"has a policy against racism\". \n\"I believe on Saturday the destruction wasn't really by racists, it was hooligans.\n\"They take advantage of the situation to destroy other businesses,\" he said.\nBut while the boards were on the way down on Thursday morning, Mr Golshan said they were not being thrown away just yet. \n\"We still need to watch what is next,\" he said.\n\"When everything is fine, then we can dispose of them,\" he added. \nOne woman, who did not want to be identified, told Radio Bristol: \"I'm just very, very proud of our little community, they did stunningly well,\" adding the night had been \"overwhelmingly peaceful\". \nAnother woman, who also asked not to be named, said: \"We all know that Bristol is very open-minded, very welcoming. \n\"There are parts [of the city] that really need more support and are struggling still, but I think overwhelmingly it is a really supporting community.\" \nNick Thomas-Symonds, the government's paymaster general and Labour MP for Torfaen, Wales, spent time in Bristol on Thursday morning. \nHe visited to thank police officers who \"put themselves in harm's way to protect the public\" and to show his support to members of the community who were affected by  disorder on Saturday. \nHe also said that people should treat speculation online with \"a lot of caution\", given the amount of misinformation seen recently. \n\"The lesson of recent days shows that that's so important.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Social workers felt \"frightened\" and \"vulnerable\" with a lack of support following disorder in Leeds last month, a union has said.\nDisturbances broke out in Harehills on 18 July as police responded to reports of social workers experiencing hostility while dealing with a child protection issue.\nUnison said staff faced \"incredibly challenging jobs\" in situations that were \"often intimidating, threatening and potentially violent\".\nLeeds City Council said it would work with social workers \"to identify learning and agreed actions arising from recent events\".\nStaff had been injured in incidents where they were \"going into people's houses when they're at their most vulnerable\", said Karen Loughlin, Unison's Yorkshire and Humberside regional secretary.\n\"They know they've got really important work to do but what they're saying is, 'I've got to be safe as well'.\"\nVideos widely shared on social media showed people reacting angrily to the children being taken from a house by officers in July.\nThat night, a bus was set on fire and a police car was overturned during disorder in the streets.\nSocial workers often had to deal with gangs of people gathering around their vehicles or going into the property they were visiting in an attempt to intimidate, Unison said.\nLow staffing levels meant workers were often on their own, the union added.\nThe council had \"failed to learn any lessons\" with a new agency staff member being sent to make contact with the same family on her own, according to Unison.\n\u201cThe council has at least said it is going to review the incident,\" Ms Loughlin said.\n\u201cBut lessons need to be learned, and quickly.

    "When Graeme Carroll started taking pictures of birds during the coronavirus pandemic, he found a natural affinity with both the art and his avian subjects. He shared some of the secrets of his success with the BBC (but don't expect him to reveal his best locations). \nGraeme suddenly stops talking mid-sentence and grabs the camera that permanently hangs on a strap from around his neck.\nHe crouches and points his long, camouflage-clad lens at a sudden frenzy of movement in the ferns beside the footpath.\n\"I'm sure it's a wren,\" he whispers.\nSuddenly, the foliage stops flittering and the chirping that had accompanied it ceases. The bird has clearly gone, evading Graeme's Sony A1 camera.\nWrens \"are very flighty,\" he says with a laugh.\nOn another day he might set up a stool and sit there for a while to see if it returns, but we've got other sites to scout.\nOver the past four years, Graeme has become something of an expert in birds and spends many hours trying to find the best spots to see them in his native Durham dales.\n\"You have got to put the time in,\" he says, as we push through waist-high ferns beside the Bollihope Burn, the beck that weaves through a small valley of old mine workings sandwiched between Weardale and Teesdale.\n\"It's always luck when you get a good picture of a bird, but there are things you can to do to increase the chances of that good luck.\"\nThis is one of his favourite bird-watching spots and one he is happy to share, chiefly because it is already well-known to many \"twitchers and toggers\", bird watchers and photographers.\nHe is very protective of his sites and guards their locations fiercely, fearful that they could be spoiled and his beloved birds disturbed if the wrong people find out where they are.\nFor Graeme, part of the fun and satisfaction is getting a shot of a truly wild creature going about its business.\nThere is one spot he likes near Muggleswick where he can lie on his back among the heather and watch the red kites soar above him.\nAbove us swallows dart through the air, Graeme takes a picture of a damsel fly and the brook to our side continues to babble.\nHe really wants to find the stonechat which he knows frequent the valley, but they prove elusive - for now.\nHe has already got a good shot of a dipper, achieved by crawling on his belly to the side of the beck to snap away on his silent camera as the little bird skipped over the pebbles.\nWe reach an enclosure, where Graeme once took a bucket-list picture of a cuckoo mid-song as it perched on a dead tree.\nHe had scouted the spot for three years waiting to see the bird, so was delighted when it finally paid off, research being a key part of his process to get the best shots.\nCutting our losses with the stonechats, we head back to his car and on to the road over the moors to Teesdale.\nUp to 80% of his time is spent in the car; some of his best shots are from his red Mazda.\nHe spends hours crawling along country lanes, his front windows down so as to not obscure any potential photo opportunity and his camera, fitted with a 200-600m lens, within easy reach on the passenger seat.\nGraeme is, he says, a very \"irritating\" driver, but mindful of that, he always pulls over to let other motorists pass.\nHe constantly scans the skies for circling silhouettes and fence posts and branches for those that may be perched.\nThe first U-turn of the day came on our way to Bollihope from his home in Wolsingham, an abrupt about-face after he saw a kestrel sitting atop one of the large red and white poles used to mark the edge of the road in the winter snows.\nThe second arrives about 10 miles (16km) later as we crest a hill and start our descent into Middleton-in-Teesdale.\nAs we pass the gateway to a farm, Graeme lets out a cry.\n\"A curlew,\" he says, and I just glimpse its long curved beak as we pass.\nHe swings the car round, exclaiming: \"You don't normally see them here at this time of the year. They and the lapwings are usually gone by now.\"\nThankfully, it is still sitting on the gate post when Graeme pulls up and he takes a flurry of shots.\nBirds are more bothered by people than cars, Graeme says, adding he can drive pretty close without disturbing them.\nKeeping the disturbance of the birds to a minimum is key for Graeme, who describes himself as an \"ethical photographer\" who follows the birdwatcher's code.\nHe won't use baits or bird calls to try and lure his subjects (the latter being illegal for a number of species), and once he has got a picture he will leave so as to not deter a bird from hunting if it has found a place it likes.\nThe fun is in scouting out and researching an area to try and find the birds in their natural habitat.\nIt all started for Graeme during the coronavirus pandemic when his hobby of playing music for several bands, including a Deep Purple tribute act, was curtailed by the cancellation of gigs.\nGraeme, who works as a website administrator for Durham County Council, needed something new to occupy him so started taking picture",
    "Two Russian dissidents released in a prisoner swap on Thursday have said they refused to sign a petition for mercy to be sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin as requested by prison officials. \nDuring a news conference in Germany, Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin said they did not admit guilt nor give Russian officials their consent to be removed, and vowed to return home one day. \nMr Kara-Murza said the deal had saved \"16 human lives\" and that he had been convinced he would die in prison. \nThe two men were released as part of the exchange, which saw 24 people jailed in seven different countries exchanged.\nThose released by Russia included US journalist Evan Gerschkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan. \nThe Russians released by Western nations included convicted assassin Vadim Krasikov, who had been serving a life sentence in Germany for killing a Georgian-born Chechen dissident in a Berlin park. \nOn Friday, Mr Kara-Murza and Mr Yashin - along with a third dissident, Andrei Pivovarov - pledged to continue working towards a \"free\" Russia and advocating on behalf of political prisoners still being held there. \nMr Yashin said he had \"conflicting feelings\" about the swap. While he expressed gratitude for those who worked to free him, he said his first desire when he arrived in Germany was to buy a ticket to return to Russia. \nMr Yashin told the BBC that it was \"much more comfortable\" for Mr Putin to have an exiled opposition \"because the voice of opposition in prison always has much more weight than the voice in emigration\". \n\u201cI never imagined myself outside Russia,\" he said. \"I am eternally grateful for their help. But I am a guest here - and my main wish is to return to Russia.\" \nHe added: \"I\u2019m not the only one who demanded not to be sent into exile... but no-one asked our opinion.\" \nHowever, he acknowledged that his return to Russia would make it more difficult to negotiate the exchange of other political prisoners and could intensify criticism of the German government, which he said had faced an \"ethical dilemma\" in releasing Krasikov. \nRussian rights group Memorial says hundreds of political prisoners are currently held in prison. \nWhile Mr Pivovarov argued the latest swap was a \"sign of light\" for them that release was possible, Mr Kara-Murza said the exchange was a \"drop in the ocean, because so many innocent people who've never committed a crime in their life are being held in torturous conditions\". \nMr Kara-Murza, a dual Russian and British citizen, said he had been held in solitary confinement for more than 10 months - and was only able to talk to his wife over the phone once during two-and-a-half years of imprisonment.\n\"I did not believe I would ever see my wife again,\" he recalled. \"I did not believe I'd ever see my family again and this feels really surreal. This feels like a film.\"\nThe political activist said he thought he might be shot on the day of his release - only realising what was happening when he saw the other imprisoned dissidents.\nHe recounted how, sitting on the plane out of Russia, a man he identified as a government agent told him it was the last time he would see his homeland. \nMr Kara-Murza said he responded: \"I know that I will be back in my home country.\"\nSasha Skochilenko, another Russian dissident and artist among those freed told BBC Newshour that she also believed she was going to be killed on the day of her release. \nMs Skochilenko said she was in \"shock\" and \"on adrenaline\" as a now-free woman. \n\"I'm so glad, I'm so happy and I'm so grateful\", she continued. \"I'm finally with my beloved family, with my girlfriend, my fianc\u00e9e. We're going to marry. We finally can do it in Germany... This is the happiest day of my life\". \nThe freed dissidents also paid tribute to Alexei Navalny, a leading critic of Mr Putin who died in prison in February after Russian officials said he became unwell.\nThe White House said on Thursday that Mr Navalny had been due to be included in a deal.\nMr Yashin said: \"The fact that Alexei Navalny is not with us is a crime committed by Putin, who bears direct responsibility for his murder.\"\nMr Kara-Murza said he wanted \"to remind people in democratic countries that Russia and Putin are not the same thing\".\n\"I will absolutely carry on,\" he told the BBC following the news conference. \n\"I care about my country - and I think Russia deserves better than a corrupt KGB dictator. I want to make sure that Russia becomes... a normal, modern, democratic country.\"",

    "Quiet and unassuming are not words you would normally associate with the athletes competing in the men's Olympic 100m.\nBut, when Sheffield's Louie Hinchliffe lines up alongside some of the biggest personalities at Paris 2024 later there will be no showboating in evidence, just a steely determination to build on his meteoric rise to fame.\nAged 17 Hinchliffe still had dreams of becoming a professional golfer, but five years on he is the first European man to win the US collegiate 100m title and was crowned British 100m champion in June.\nNow as he prepares to compete against the world's best sprinters his former and current coaches agree he has a real chance of taking home the gold medal. \n\"The sky is the limit.\" Those were the words of nine-time Olympic gold-medallist Carl Lewis to describe Hinchliffe's potential after he clinched victory in the British Championships.\n\"If he runs his best, he will make the Olympic final,\" he added.\n\"Once you're in the final, you're in with a shot.\"\nBut the former Olympic sprinter and long jumper, who has been coaching Hinchliffe for the past year, is not the the first to recognise his talent.\n\"He's got as good a chance as whoever else is there,\" said Paul Hohn, who first began working with him when he was just 11.\nHohn, whose daughter Zara competed for Great Britain as a hurdler, said although Hinchliffe was untypically \"shy\" for a sprinter, his potential was obvious from an early age.\n\"I always said, both to Louie and his parents, 'I believe he will get to the top'.\n\"That's how I motivated him.\"\nA former pupil at Notre Dame High School in Sheffield, Hinchliffe moved to America in 2023 after earning a scholarship at the University of Washington and later with the University of Houston where he began working with Lewis.\nSpeaking from the family home in Sheffield, his father, Stuart, a former professional goalkeeper with Leyton Orient, explained how his son's decision to move to the US helped him fulfil his potential.\n\"One, he's got to look after himself. Two, he's got to study.

He's still humble because he's had a Filippino upbringing,\" she said.\n\"I said to him 'Are you going to win?'. He said that's not the right question. His mentality is stay calm because he doesn't want any pressure.\"\nStuart said \"the journey isn't finished\" for his son and added: \"hopefully it can continue for a few more days\".\n\"He should get through the heats, then it's finals and anything can happen.\n\"He's still far from the finished article.

    "It is an area which has seen its fair share of trouble, including serious rioting last summer.\nNow, runners from Londonderry's Galliagh estate have urged young people to put down petrol bombs and take up exercise.\nLast August, violence flared in the predominantly nationalist area after wood and other material was removed from a bonfire site. \nSo, this year, Galliagh community centre, which was damaged during last year\u2019s trouble, has launched a programme of summer events.\n\u201cI once hung around the back of shops smoking, drinking and getting up to all sorts but now I\u2019m addicted to running,\u201d said local man, Matthew McLaughlin.\nMr McLaughlin, who lives 400m from where the starting line was for the Galliagh F\u00e9ile 5K run, told BBC News NI how he turned his life around through exercise.\n\u201cThe young people need to listen and make changes through the positive work now going on in Galliagh.\n\u201cI changed my life for my sons and wanted to get fit.

I can see a change over the past few years and that\u2019s something for us to latch onto.\"\nShe is hopeful the violence of last year will not be repeated. \n\u201cI urge those who are curious in any way about what community work is being done to just come and see us,\" she said. \"We will listen too.\u201d\nGary Clarke, from Galliagh, completed a \"Couch to 5k\" challenge a few years ago and now sees the benefit of regular exercise.\nHe said areas like Galliagh often get bad press but it does not paint the full picture of all the positive things that are happening.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to change the headlines in Galliagh and keep the community spirit up,\" he said.\n\"The 5k run meant people from all over could come into Galliagh, too, to take part and that shouldn\u2019t be underestimated either.\n\u201cNot all young people are the same and they shouldn\u2019t be judged the same. Quite a few young people signed up to the Galliagh 5K which can only be a positive step in the right direction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a change in attitude and a change in exercise.

    "A man who suffered a heart attack during a family day out at a water park has been reunited with the lifeguards who saved him. \nWater sports enthusiast Dave Francis was at the aqua park at Rutland Water in Oakham in May when he suddenly collapsed.\nHis wife watched on from the shore as the lifeguards, aged 17, and their duty manager sprung into action to give the 64-year-old CPR.\nOn Friday, Mr Francis, from Surrey, was reunited with the life-saving duo to thank them. \nMr Francis's wife Sheryl had seen him collapse as he took part in the water park activities with his niece and nephew and called for help.\n\"One minute I was having a brilliant day enjoying the obstacles, and the next thing I remember is waking up with ear defenders on in the air ambulance,\" Mr Francis said.\nLifeguards George Pollard and Reuben Hutchinson alongside duty manager Nathan Liptrot, had acted fast to give Mr Francis CPR. \nIt was Mr Pollard's first day as a lifeguard and Mr Hutchinson's second shift, while the water park had only been open for a few days.\nThe park partially closed to give the lifeguards and paramedics space to treat Mr Francis.\nAqua Park manager, Charlotte Bambrick, then worked with them to continue trying to save him, using CPR and a defibrillator, for more than 20 minutes, the park organisers said. \nMr Francis was recovering well after a short stay in Leicester\u2019s Glenfield Hospital and surgery.\nAfter the \"dramatic\" events of that day, the lifeguards had wondered what happened to Mr Francis and wanted to see him again, prompting the park owners to arrange Friday's meeting. \nMr Francis said: \"I\u2019ll forever be grateful to George, Reuben, Nathan and Charlotte, they are heroes in my eyes, and I\u2019m so pleased to be able to express my gratitude to them in person. \n\"I must also thank the East Midlands Air Ambulance, the paramedics, doctors and nurses, who continued the work to save my life.\"\nHe added that he was fortunate he could not remember the experience and that he hoped to do something to help others who might find themselves in the same position. \nMr Francis's family was told he was \"lucky\" to have had the heart attack at the park, where there were trained lifeguards and a defibrillator.\nMs Bambrick said: \"Of course, looking back, it\u2019s quite a dramatic situation, but we didn\u2019t think about that during the event and simply tried our best to help save Dave\u2019s life.\n\"Everything happened very suddenly, and we just followed our training plan, worked together, and tried to stay calm.\n\"It was quite emotional afterwards because, while we train for these scenarios, we don't expect them to actually happen.\"\nEast Midlands Air Ambulance praised Mr Pollard and Mr Hutchinson for being \"lifesavers\", saying the \"outcome could have been a lot worse\" without their training and the defibrillator. \n\"It shows how the right training and equipment can literally save lives,\"  a spokesperson said.\n\"They should both be very proud of themselves and what they did that day.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Scotland's first minister has described Elon Musk's behaviour as \"completely and utterly unacceptable\u201d after the billionaire owner of X branded Humza Yousaf \"racist\" and a \"scumbag\". \nJohn Swinney defended his predecessor, who has described Mr Musk as a \"race baiter\" and \"one of the most dangerous men on the planet\u201d.\nThe tech entrepreneur suggested he would welcome legal action from Mr Yousaf.\nThe former first minister declined to speak to BBC Scotland. \nHowever, Mr Swinney said his predecessor had faced racist and Islamophobic abuse for many years.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why he has taken such a strong stance about the unacceptable conduct and content that we\u2019ve heard from Elon Musk,\" the first minister told BBC Scotland.\nFollowing anti-immigrant riots in England and Northern Ireland in recent weeks, Mr Swinney echoed calls from regulator Ofcom for social media firms to urgently protect users from content likely to incite violence or hatred.\nMr Musk has been highly critical of the UK authorities and the way the disorder has been handled.\nMr Swinney said he had not received a response from X to a letter he had written to social media companies on the riots.\n\u201cThe conduct of Elon Musk is wholly unacceptable and the conduct of the social media company is just as unacceptable and needs to be tackled,\" he said. \nThe first minister said that while the riots had not spread north of the border, he wanted to ensure social media firms \"do not behave in a fashion that creates difficulties\" for communities in Scotland. \nMr Swinney was asked if the SNP or the Scottish government could step in to financially assist his predecessor in a possible legal case against Mr Musk, but said that was a matter for Mr Yousaf. \nThe most recent spat between Mr Musk and Mr Yousaf began last Thursday.\nSpeaking at an event at the Edinburgh Festival, the former first minister branded the X owner \u201cone of the most dangerous men on the planet\u201d.\n\u201cHe is not accountable to anybody, he has vast wealth at his fingertips and disposal and he uses it for some of the most wicked evil I have seen,\u201d he told LBC.\nMr Yousaf accused Mr Musk of using his wealth to amplify the far right and white supremacists.\nAfter the ex-SNP leader made similar comments to CNN, Mr Musk described him as \"super, super racist\". \nHe posted on X: \"Scotland gave him everything and yet he loathes white people.\u201d\nIn the Sunday Mail, Mr Yousaf\u2019s lawyer Aamer Anwar said the X owner had \u201ceffectively painted a target on Humza Yousaf\u2019s back with his completely unacceptable, untrue and inflammatory comments\u201d.\nThe newspaper reported that Mr Yousaf had not ruled out legal action and was \u201cconsidering all options\u201d.\nMr Yousaf also posted on X: \u201cElon Musk is a dangerous race baiter who must be held to account for his actions.\n\u201cI can't think what it is that upsets him so much about a Brown, Muslim, progressive politician? But his billions won't stop me calling out his support for the far-right.\u201d\nMr Musk again responded online, claiming Mr Yousaf was \"obviously super racist against white people\". \n\"I dare that scumbag to sue me,\" he said. \"Go ahead, make my day\u2026\u201d\nMr Musk added: \u201cLegal discovery will show that however big a racist he\u2019s been in public communications, he is vastly worse in private communications.\u201d\nThis is not the first public spat between the pair.\nIn October last year, while Mr Yousaf was first minister, Mr Musk branded him a \u201cblatant racist\u201d.\nThe billionaire made the comment in response to an edited clip of a speech Mr Yousaf gave in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. The clip has once again been shared widely by right-wing accounts in recent days.\nA fact check by the Reuters news agency concluded that the clip misrepresented Mr Yousaf's comments by suggesting he had been arguing that Scotland contained too many white people \u2013 when he had been about racial injustice and a lack of people of colour in positions of power.\nResponding last year, Mr Yousaf\u2019s spokesperson said Mr Musk should instead \"tackle racism and hatred that goes unchecked on the social media platform he owns\".",
    "Something remarkable has happened to A23a, the world's biggest iceberg.\nFor months now it has been spinning on the spot just north of Antarctica when really it should be racing along with Earth's most powerful ocean current.\nScientists say the frozen block, which is more than twice the size of Greater London, has been captured on top of a huge rotating cylinder of water.\nIt's a phenomenon oceanographers call a Taylor Column - and it's possible A23a might not escape its jailer for years.\n\"Usually you think of icebergs as being transient things; they fragment and melt away. But not this one,\" observed polar expert Prof Mark Brandon.\n\"A23a is the iceberg that just refuses to die,\" the Open University researcher told BBC News.\nThe berg's longevity is well documented. It broke free from the Antarctic coastline way back in 1986, but then almost immediately got stuck in the bottom-muds of the Weddell Sea.\nFor three decades it was a static \"ice island\". It didn't budge. It wasn't until 2020 that it re-floated and started to drift again, slowly at first, before then charging north towards warmer air and waters.\nIn early April this year, A23a stepped into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) - a juggernaut that moves a hundred times as much water around the globe as all Earth's rivers combined.\nThis was meant to put boosters on the near-trillion-tonne berg, rifling it up into the South Atlantic and certain oblivion. \nInstead, A23a went precisely nowhere. It remains in place just north of South Orkney Islands, turning in an anti-clockwise direction by about 15 degrees a day. And as long as it does this, its decay and eventual demise will be delayed.\nA23a has not grounded again; there is at least a thousand metres of water between its underside and the seafloor.\nIt's been stopped in its tracks by a type of vortex first described in the 1920s by a brilliant physicist, Sir G.I. (Geoffrey Ingram) Taylor.\nThe Cambridge academic was a pioneer in the field of fluid dynamics, and was even brought into the Manhattan Project to model the likely stability of the world's first atomic bomb test. \nProf Taylor showed how a current that meets an obstruction on the seafloor can - under the right circumstances - separate into two distinct flows, generating a full-depth mass of rotating water between them.\nIn this instance, the obstruction is a 100km-wide bump on the ocean bottom known as Pirie Bank. The vortex sits on top of the bank, and for now A23a is its prisoner.\n\"The ocean is full of surprises, and this dynamical feature is one of the cutest you'll ever see,\" said Prof Mike Meredith from the British Antarctic Survey.\n\"Taylor Columns can also form in the air; you see them in the movement of clouds above mountains. They can be just a few centimetres across in an experimental laboratory tank or absolutely enormous as in this case where the column has a giant iceberg slap-bang in the middle of it.\"\nHow long might A23a continue to perform its spinning-top routine? \nWho knows, but when Prof Meredith placed a scientific buoy in a Taylor Column above another bump to the east of Pirie Bank, the floating instrument was still rotating in place four years later.\nA23a is a perfect illustration once again of the importance of understanding the shape of the seafloor.\nSubmarine mountains, canyons and slopes have a profound influence on the direction and mixing of waters, and on the distribution of the nutrients that drive biological activity in the ocean.\nAnd this influence extends also to the climate system: it's the mass movement of water that helps disperse heat energy around the globe.\nA23a's behaviour can be explained because the ocean bottom just north of South Orkney is reasonably well surveyed.\nThat's not the case for much of the rest of the world.\nCurrently, only a quarter of Earth's seafloor has been mapped to the best modern standard.\nAn earlier version of this story contained an illustrative map of the English Channel containing an iceberg that was slightly over-sized. This has now been amended.",

    "The six-tonne Altar Stone at the heart of Stonehenge came from the far north of Scotland rather than south-west Wales as previously thought, new analysis has found.\nThe discovery shows the construction of Stonehenge was a far greater collaborative effort than scientists realised.\nIt also means that the ancient monument, near Salisbury in south-west England, was built with stones from all parts of Great Britain.\nThe findings suggest Neolithic Britain was a far more connected and advanced society than earlier evidence indicated.\nThe distance between Stonehenge and the far north of Scotland is about 700km (434 miles).\nThe research was led by a Welsh PhD student, Anthony Clarke, now working at Curtin University in Western Australia. \nSuch is the importance of the discovery that it has been published in one of the world\u2019s leading scientific journals, Nature, which is an enormous achievement for an apprentice researcher.\nBut it is a bittersweet moment for the young Welshman, who was born in Pembrokeshire, where the Altar Stone was until now thought to have come from.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be forgiven by people back home,\u201d he joked to BBC News. \u201cIt will be a great loss for Wales!\u201d\nBut Mr Clarke points out that the remaining stones in the central horseshoe, which are known as bluestones, are from Wales and the larger stones in the outer circle are from England.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to give the Scots something!\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut on a serious note, Stonehenge seems to be this great British endeavour involving all the different people from all over the island,\" he said.\nThe bluestones at Stonehenge were identified as coming from the Preseli hills in Pembrokeshire in 1923, by Welsh geologist Henry Herbert Thomas. The central Altar Stone was made of a different rock but always assumed to have come from the same area, until 20 years ago when scientists first began to question its origins.\nLast year, researchers including Prof Nick Pearce from Aberystwyth in Wales, of all places, concluded that the Altar Stone could not have come from Wales. But its origin had remained a mystery, until now.\n\u201cIt blew our socks off when we discovered it was from north-east Scotland,\u201d Prof Pearce, who was also involved in the current discovery, told BBC News.\n\u201cIt was a shock to say the least. Coming from that distance, more than 700km, was remarkable.\n\u201cThe Neolithic people must have been pretty well connected, far more connected than people give them credit for. They must have been very well organised\u201d.\nThe breakthrough was made by the team at Curtin university who analysed the chemical composition of fragments of rock that had fallen off the Altar Stone and dated them. The composition and date are unique to rocks from different parts of the world, rather like a fingerprint.\nThe Australian team had access to one of the most comprehensive global rock fingerprint databases and found the best match was from the Orcadian Basin, which includes the Caithness, Orkney, and Moray Firth regions of north-eastern Scotland.\nConstruction at Stonehenge began 5,000 years ago, with changes and additions over the next two millennia. Most of the bluestones are believed to have been the first stones erected at the site.\nDr Robert Ixer, from University College London, who was also involved in the study, described the result as \u201cshocking\u201d.\n\u201cThe work prompts two important questions: how was the Altar Stone transported from the very north of Scotland, a distance of more than 700 kilometres, to Stonehenge, and, more intriguing, why?\u201d\nThe distance is the longest recorded journey for any stone used in a monument at that period and Prof Peace says that the next mystery to solve is how it got there.\n\u201cThere are obvious physical barriers to transporting by land, and an equally daunting journey if going by sea.\n\u201cThese findings will have huge ramifications for understanding communities in Neolithic times, their levels of connectivity and their transport systems\u201d.\nThe new research will be pored over by archaeologists working for English Heritage, which looks after Stonehenge, according to one of the monument\u2019s senior curators, Heather Sebire.\n\u201dThis discovery certainly implies that there were great social connections in Britain at the time,\u201d she told BBC News.\n\u201cIt is phenomenal that the people of the time brought such a large stone all this way. They must have had a compelling reason to do it.\n\u201cThey had a sophisticated and developed society and so they probably had a spiritual side, just like we do\u201c.",
    "Almost 1,000 incidents of self harm were recorded at a prison in just under a year, a report has found. \nWhile government inspectors identified improvements at HMP Bristol during an inspection in June, they deemed the prison had made \"insufficient progress\" on suicide and self harm. \nA previous report, published in 2023, said the prison had \"chronic and intractable\" problems and was \"one of the most unsafe\" in the country. \nHM Chief Inspector of Prisons Charlie Taylor said progress made by the governor \"should be commended\" but it was \"fragile\".\nOf the six concerns highlighted in that report, four were found to have seen good progress, with \"reasonable progress\" in one and \"insufficient process\" in the other. \nAfter the 2023 inspection Mr Taylor sent an \"urgent notification\" letter to the Lord Chancellor, with then-Prisons Minister Damian Hinds saying \"urgent action\" was being taken. \nThe most recent report, published on Monday, found that improvements had been made to levels of staffing with previous shortages significantly restricting daily activities for prisoners - leaving most locked in their cells for almost 22 hours a day. \nThe prison is now fully staffed, the report said, and \"able to run a consistent daily routine for prisoners\" with activities such as education, work and health care appointments no longer routinely cancelled. \nThe prison had also made \"good progress\" in addressing very high levels of violence, reducing incidents by approximately a quarter with a continued downward trend - though \"rates of violence remained higher than in similar prisons\". \nLeaders had used a number of \"creative initiatives\" to address gang affiliations and debt management, inspectors said, though some lower-level behaviour such as men vaping outside cells went unchallenged. \nAnother key concern identified in 2023 was illicit drugs being \"readily available\" to prisoners\", but inspectors found that \"good progress\" had also been made in this area with a \"wide range of security actions\" introduced to disrupt the supply of drugs into the prison. \nThe only area in which the prison had made insufficient progress was in suicide and self-harm prevention, with two self-inflicted deaths recorded at HMP Bristol since the previous report was published. \nInspectors found rates of self-harm remained \"very high\", at almost double the average rate at similar prisons. \nSince July 2023, there had been 986 incidents of self-harm, with 32 requiring hospital treatment and two investigated as near-fatal incidents.\nThe report stated that reviews for at-risk prisoners were \"on time and mostly thorough\", case managers \"took too long to carry out welfare checks\" and were not always available to react \"promptly\". \nFinally, the report found that leadership had made \"reasonable progress\" is work to prepare prisoners for release, though \"some fragilities\" were observed in access to accommodation on release and support for prisoner held on remand. \nIn a statement in the report Mr Taylor said: \"The progress made by the governor [Vanessa Prendergast], her leadership team and staff should be commended; however, this progress is fragile. \n\"Violence, while reduced, remains higher than in most other reception prisons and levels of self-harm have not yet come down.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Judy Murray has said she remains frustrated at the lack of a legacy in Scotland from her son Andy's tennis career after his decision to retire.\nSir Andy Murray brought the curtain down on a glittering 20-year career after losing in the quarter-finals of the men's doubles at the Olympics in Paris on Thursday.\nHe has been hailed as Scotland's greatest ever sportsman after winning three Grand Slam titles and two Olympic gold medals.\nBut his mother - who was also his coach in the early years of his career - believes not enough has been done in his home country to build on his global success.\n\u201cWhat he has done has changed the face of British tennis,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI suppose, if I had a wish, I wish we had more in Scotland to show for it.\n\u201cI think people get sick of hearing that we\u2019ll never have another Andy or Jamie Murray.\n\"But they\u2019ve built this enormous fan base in Scotland and all over the world, so why shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d\nThe Lawn Tennis Association recently pledged \u00a35m to a new community tennis centre near Dunblane.\nThe project, led by Judy Murray, includes plans for a multi-sport site including outdoor tennis and padel courts.\nJudy added: \"Certainly, we have the will to invest in the game in Scotland.\n\"We're trying to build a multi-sport community centre with tennis at the heart of it just out of Dunblane, which we run as a charitable foundation.\n\"We are all really relishing the opportunity to give back to a sport that has given us so much.\"\nJudy has spoken out in the past about the lack of funding for public courts across Scotland.\nShe has also criticised Scottish tennis for failing to live up to its promise to leave a lasting legacy by building on the success of her sons.\nShe said in 2021: \"I predicted, quite some time ago, that Jamie and Andy would retire and there would be nothing to show for it, and I really feel that now.\n\"We will never get this chance again.\"\nKaren Ross, who is head of performance at Tennis Scotland, believes indoor facilities are key to discovering the next Andy Murray.\nShe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"To be able to play all year round is a massive benefit. We've seen that with facilities coming on in Moray and in Oriam (Scotland's sports performance centre in Edinburgh).\n\"To have competitions all year round gives far more opportunities for the players to compete and train.\n\"We don't have the benefits of the weather like Spain or some of the other countries, so indoor facilities makes a massive difference.\"\nMeanwhile, Judy Murray says she is looking forward to spending more time with her son after his retirement.\nShe said she is excited about what comes next for Andy and admits he has been thinking about retiring for some time.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s been considering at least since his hip operation in 2017,\" Judy said.\n\u201cAnd you know it\u2019s a shame because when he got that injury, he was number one in the world and playing the best tennis of career.\n\"Typically for him, he fought to give himself the chance to get back on the tour and start playing again. His resilience and determination, and his attention to detail in rehab in getting the best out of himself, are second to none.\n\u201cBut now he feels it\u2019s the right time physically and emotionally and he\u2019s ready to move on to the next stage of his life, whatever that may be.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually really excited to see what he does next.\u201d",

    "He knew nine languages, published around 150 works and was friendly with the founding fathers of America.\nHowever, in Britain, Joseph Priestley is perhaps best remembered for his science - especially in Wiltshire, where he captured oxygen 250 years ago this month.\nPriestley spent seven years in Wiltshire, in quite luxurious surroundings.\nHe was employed by the Earl of Shelburne, who owned Bowood House near Calne.\nBowood is just as glamourous today as it was then, with the room that was Priestley's laboratory changed, but intact.\nThe house is open to the public and has put an exhibition on based off Priestley's time there from 1773.\nThere are dressed-up tour guides taking people round - Rob Miller has been one of them.\nHe explained that the Earl was in need of a librarian and someone to guide his sons' educations - but also an \"intellectual companion.\"\nPriestley was not sure at first though, even writing to his friend Benjamin Franklin for advice.\nFranklin suggested a pros and cons list.\nIn the end, he went and Mr Miller explained that Priestley's duties \"were not onerous in the slightest - he looked after his books and advised on the education of the sons, but they had a full time tutor as well. \n\"He had plenty of time for his experiments and plenty of resources.\"\nIn other words, the Earl of Shelburne was generous with his cash.\nOn display is original documentation, like letters and a bill for laboratory equipment.\n\"It comes to \u00a3155, 14 shillings, which to me is quite a lot of money, but this was in the 1770s, that would be about \u00a313,500 pounds now. Of course it wasn't his money, he was spending quite liberally,\" said Mr Miller.\nThe order included a lot of packing cases, but also things like vials, an electrical machine, conductor, a scale beam, syringes and an insulated stand.\nOverall though - from the bills and receipts in the Bowood archive - the Earl spent money today worth \u00a330,000 on chemicals and science equipment.\nWith that equipment though, Priestley captured oxygen - and there was animal testing involved.\nMr Miller explained the process: \"With a burning lens, he used the sun's rays to burn mercuric oxide. He then collected the gas that was emitted and kept this in an airtight jar.\n\"He played around with the air in there - he didn't know what was in there at all at that point.\n\"He first put a mouse and candle in there. The mouse died sadly and the candle lost it's flame.\n\"He added mint to the jar and the mouse lived much longer and and the candle burned longer. He realised then that the mint plant was emitting air, what we now know as oxygen. So he nearly discovered photosynthesis.\"\nPhotosynthesis was discovered by someone he knew, Jan Ingenhousz, just a few years later, also at Bowood.\nHowever, through this, Priestley had isolated oxygen - though he called it \"dephlogisticated air\" - and published his findings before anyone else who may have done similar.\nHe declared it \"five or six times as good as common air.\"\nPart of the exhibition is something more modern - a can of Schweppes soda water.\nThat's because - in the words of Mr Miller - \"we should be drinking gin and Priestly!\"\nHe added: \"Priestly discovered the process for making carbonated water - ultimately he didn't make a penny from that. It was down to Schweppe who patented that idea.\n\"He was actually awarded a medal by the Royal Society for that discovery,\" explained Mr Miller.\nPriestley has also been credited with inventing the rubber eraser - though he failed to patent that himself as well.\nWhile Priestley did not discover the soft drink at Bowood, locals in Calne have been remembering his work this year.\nA community tapestry has been created and a mural commissioned.\nCalne Heritage Centre has also put on its own exhibition.\nPriestley was a man of many talents and people at the time would also have known him for his writing on a number of subjects - history, religion and politics included.\nHe came to Bowood at 40, married with a family.\nHis youngest child was born in Calne and called Henry, at the request of the Earl of Shelburne.\nHowever, his position at Bowood did not last forever.\nPriestley's views often got him into trouble - he was controversial when it came to religion and supported both the French Revolution and American independence.\nNone of this made him popular in England. After Calne, he went to Birmingham, where a mob burned down his home, then to London and eventually to the United States.\nIn America, life was different - after all, he already knew Benjamin Franklin and became friendly with Thomas Jefferson.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "People living in a community that was hit by mass disorder over the weekend have said they \"will not let hate win\".\nMore than \u00a3134,000 has been raised so far by those living in Walton, Liverpool, after a group of up to 300 people set fire to Spellow Lane Library Hub on Saturday evening.\nThe library, on County Road, opened last year to serve deprived communities in Walton.\nIt was left with severe fire damage to its ground floor after the riot which saw people looting shops and setting fire to wheelie bins.\nAlex McCormick, from Liverpool, set up a fundraiser for the Spellow Lane Library Hub, with the intention of raising \u00a3500 to buy new books.\nWithin just a few days the GoFundMe page had raised more than \u00a3134,000 and that figure is rising.\nIt has attracted support not just from the community but from key figures including TV chef Nigella Lawson and children\u2019s laureate Frank Cottrell-Boyce.\nMs McCormick told BBC Radio Merseyside: \"The response has been overwhelming and it is such a testament to how the community comes together, how amazing people are and the good will always outweigh the bad.\"\nShe said donations had come from all over the world including the US, Canada and Dubai.\n\"It has gone further than I could ever have imagined,\" she said.\n\"It's not just me who has done this, it's the community who has come together. It is heart-warming to see.\"\nMs McCormick has been liaising with library staff and Liverpool City Council to ensure the funds will be spent on the library, which is also used as a community hub for children's classes and other activities. \nCouncillor Ruth Bennett, cabinet member for finances, resources and transformation, said the council had been overwhelmed by the generosity shown.\nShe said it showed \"the very best\" of Liverpool people.\n\"We are working hard behind the scenes to set up a central point of contact and system which will allow us to formally accept donations and offers of help moving forward,\" she added.\n\u201cOn behalf of the city -  thank you.

    "\"Any doubt is just a joke. Stress only makes us stronger,\" Qin Haiyang - a part of China's history-making men\u2019s 4x100m medley quartet posted after their unprecedented victory over the US on Monday. \nQin's seeming defiance came at the tail end of what has been a challenging time for China in the pool. \nSome of the country's top swimmers - including Qin and his relay teammate Sun Jiajun- have faced a slew of doping allegations, followed by contentious US claims that the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) was covering it up. \nThey were among 23 Chinese swimmers who returned positive doping tests ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.\nAnd although Chinese swimmers have been drug-tested twice as much as some other nations this year before heading to Paris, their performance has been met with scepticism.\nAfter the medley event on Monday, Team GB's Adam Peaty opened fire on the Chinese team, saying \"there's no point winning if you're not winning fair\".\nSwim legend Michael Phelps, who has been vocal about doping issues, also doubled down: \"If you test positive, you should never be allowed to come back and compete again, cut and dry. I believe one and done,\" he told the Associated Press news agency.\nTo the Chinese swimming team and their millions of fans back home, however, the historic victory brought joy and vindication. \nThe hashtag \"China wins gold medal at 4x100m medley relay\" was viewed 760 million times on Weibo.\nOne comment racked up more than 8,000 likes on Weibo: \"China's gold medals are squeaky clean, we won it with our competence!\" \n\"It's been so hard for the Chinese swimming team,\" read another top comment. \nThe immense pressure the team has been under was reflected in comments by China's new breakout star Pan Zhanle, who swam the crucial anchor leg of the relay, and also won the men's 100m freestyle final, setting a new world record. \nAfter his win last week, Pan, who was not among those who tested positive for doping, told Chinese media that he felt that the whole team was \"looked down on\" by some foreign swimmers. He also said that Australia's Kyle Chalmers had snubbed him when he tried to say hello - which Chalmers denied.  \nPan's record-breaking swim was questioned by former Australian Olympic swimmer Brett Hawke who posted on Instagram that it's not \"humanly possible to beat that field\".\nIt wasn't the first comment of its kind. German athlete Angelina K\u00f6hler cast doubt on Zhang Yufei's bronze win in the women's 100m butterfly -  she too was among the 23 who had tested positive in 2021. \nAfte the swim, K\u00f6hler, who did not make the podium, reportedly told media that \"stories like that always have a bad flavour\", \nZhang, who won a silver and five bronzes in Paris, was defiant. \n\"Why should Chinese swimmers be questioned when they swim fast? Why did no one dare to question USA's Michael Phelps when he got eight gold medals?\" she asked in a press conference.\nThe tension has spilled beyond the pool. China's anti-doping agency (Chinada) released a statement on Tuesday, accusing its US counterpart Usada of displaying double standards. \nThe press release highlighted the case of US sprinter Erriyon Knighton, a world silver medallist who is competing in the men's 200m sprint this week. He was not suspended after testing positive for the banned substance trenbolone earlier this year. Like in the case of the Chinese swimmers, the arbitrator had found the result was likely caused by contaminated meat.\nChinese fans, meanwhile, have been reacting furiously, to the accusations against the country's swimmers.   \nAdam Peaty's Instagram account was flooded with angry comments - even his girlfriend's account was not spared. \n\"Curious why you're only attacking China but none of the other countries that won ahead of you... pretty weird,\" a top comment under Peaty's most recent post reads. \nFollowing a barrage of critcism from Chinese fans,  Brett Hawke, the former Olympic swimmer who is now a coach, deleted the video he had posted about Pan. He also limited comments on his posts. \nAnd a recent post about the men's medley results says: \"Chinese men are victorious!\"",

    "India's top female wrestler Vinesh Phogat has been disqualified after failing the weigh-in ahead of the final match at the Olympic Games.\nThe 29-year-old was scheduled to face the US's Sarah Hildebrandt in the 50kg freestyle category on Wednesday - which would have guaranteed her at least a silver medal.\nBut Phogat weighed in a few grams above the 50kg limit on the morning of the contest, the Indian Olympic Association said.\nHer disqualification means she will not win any medal and will be ranked last in the competition. \nThe announcement has sparked heartbreak in India, where there has been an outpouring of disappointment. \nThis was Phogat's third appearance at the Olympics, and the closest she had ever been to winning a medal. On Tuesday, she became the first Indian female wrestler to make it to the final, after she defeated Cuba's Yusneylys Guzman 5-0.\nHer performance also included one of the biggest upsets at the Games so far, after she beat reigning world champion Yui Susaki from Japan to progress to the quarter-finals.\nReports say the wrestler was above the weight limit by 2kg on Tuesday night, following which she tried everything to shed the pounds - from cycling and jogging to skipping.\nBut \"despite the best efforts by the team through the night, she weighed in a few grams over 50kg this morning\", the Indian Olympic Association said in a statement. \nDrastic weight loss before a bout is not uncommon as wrestlers go through an extreme process to meet the category limit, sometimes with just hours to go.\nBut this can be dangerous as it involves losing large amounts of fluids very quickly. The practice also occurs in other combat sports like boxing and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).\nIn the previous two Olympics, Phogat had competed in the 53kg category. This was her first outing in the 50kg category and the wrestler reportedly struggled to meet the weight requirement during her Olympic qualifiers as well.\n\"The Indian team requests you respect Vinesh\u2019s privacy. It would like to focus on the competitions on hand,\" the association said, refusing to comment further. \nLast year, Phogat had become the face of a months-long protest by wrestlers against their federation chief Brij Bhushan Singh who was accused of sexually harassing female athletes - a charge he denies. \nThe row made headlines globally, especially after the police detained Phogat and other wrestlers when they tried to march to India's new parliament building.\nAfter Wednesday's announcement, support poured in for the wrestler as fans said she was still a hero to them.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi called her a \"champion of champions\" and said she was an inspiration for all Indians. \n\"Today's setback hurts. I wish words could express the sense of despair that I am experiencing,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter). \n\"At the same time, I know that you epitomise resilience. It has always been your nature to take challenges head on. Come back stronger! We are all rooting for you,\" he said.\n",
    "The King has praised the way \"community spirit\" and \"compassion\" have countered the \"aggression and criminality\" on display during the riots, says Buckingham Palace.\nKing Charles had been in phone conversations on Friday evening with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and police chiefs.\nHe gave his \"heartfelt thanks to the police and emergency services for all they are doing to restore peace in those areas that have been affected by violent disorder\", said a palace spokesman.\nIn a call for unity, the King hoped that \"shared values of mutual respect and understanding will continue to strengthen and unite the nation\".\nKing Charles, currently in Scotland, spoke to the prime minister about the wave of disorder and riots.\nIn another joint call, the King spoke to Chief Constable\u00a0Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, and to UK Gold Commander Ben Harrington, Chief Constable of Essex, thanking the police for their efforts and getting an update on the protests.\n\"The King shared how he had been greatly encouraged by the many examples of community spirit that had countered the aggression and criminality from a few with the compassion and resilience of the many,\" said a palace spokesman.\nThere had been questions about whether the King would speak about the riots - and as a politically neutral monarch he had left the initial response to ministers.\nBut the King has a long record of working to build bridges between different faiths and cultures - calling Britain a \"community of communities\".\nAnd against the divisions revealed during this unrest, he has made his views known, calling for tolerance and \"mutual respect and understanding\".\nHe is said to have been involved in behind-the-scenes efforts to bring together communities affected by the riots, during his summer break in Scotland, in a year in which he has been treated for cancer.\nBut it is not expected that the King will make any immediate visits to trouble spots until the unrest is over, with the response to the protests seen as being the responsibility of the government.\nThis follows the pattern seen after the outbreak of riots in 2011, during which Queen Elizabeth didn\u2019t put out any messages, but royal visits took place after calm had been restored.\nThe King, then Prince Charles, subsequently visited Tottenham and other affected areas to encourage cross-community relations in the wake of the riots.\nThere had previously been criticism of the lack of an intervention by the King.\n\"We're told the monarch is supposed to be a figurehead who unites the nation, yet when the nation is in crisis he's nowhere to be seen,\" said Graham Smith, leader of the anti-monarchy group Republic.\nThat was rejected by historian and author Sir Anthony Seldon, who said the King should not get immediately involved in debates over the riots.\n\"He is head of state, and it\u2019s appropriate that while the crisis is going on, the head of government, the prime minister, handles the crisis management and says what is needed to be said.\n\"The time for the King to speak, if at all, is when everything has calmed down again,\" Sir Anthony told the BBC.\nAnother practical sensitivity about carrying out any immediate royal visits to riot-hit areas has been a worry about adding pressure to police on the ground.",
    "Businesses in Sleaford have said they are frustrated at the impact of pedestrianisation work in the town centre.\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, some of those based in Market Place in the Lincolnshire town think the work could affect customer footfall even when it is finished.\nMitchell Griffiths, manager of CECE\u2019S Bar & Grill, said business had been \"really quiet\" recently, as many people did not realise there was pedestrian access to the businesses around the construction work.\nNorth Kesteven District Council, which has allocated more than \u00a31m to the scheme, said the work would boost footfall and would create \"a more attractive space for shops and traders to operate in\".\nCouncil leader Richard Wright said the scheme would enable Sleaford to remain \"vibrant and successful as a town centre\".\nHe added: \"We are conscious that these are some significant works and are working with our contractor to mitigate the impact as much as we can.\n\"The hoarding is a necessary measure and is there primarily for everyone\u2019s safety, while also helping to keep debris and rising dust contained as much as possible.\"\nCECE's relies heavily on collections of online orders but, since the closure of Market Place, the convenience of parking outside the business has gone.\nMr Griffiths said: \"We\u2019ve had people come in and say they struggled to get here, and most of our customers are walk-ins, so we\u2019ve been quieter through the week as well.\n\"There\u2019s also been no advice on financial help or funding, even compensation, which is frustrating because we\u2019ve definitely noticed a difference. The next three months are going to be a big struggle.\"\nMarket Place closed at the end of July and work started in August, with a view to it being completed in December \u2013 meaning Remembrance Day services will be moved elsewhere in November, and the market will be moved to Eastgate car park for the duration.\nIt\u2019s been a controversial topic for many months, and several business owners around the square said they were frustrated with the plan itself, as well as with the current impact of the work on their trade.\nThe Solo, a bistro bar and hotel on Market Street, has been one of the more passionate opposing voices to the council\u2019s plans, and owner Roy Corder and manager Fran Rawden said they were yet to be convinced.\n\u201cIt looks good on design, but there\u2019s no practicality to it,\u201d they said. \u201cPedestrianisation just doesn\u2019t make sense in England, especially with our weather.

    "More cows could be kept indoors for the whole of their productive lives, animal welfare campaigners have warned, after the BBC found a rise in \u201cmegafarms\u201d.\nFreedom of Information (FOI) requests by the BBC show the number of larger-scale beef and dairy farms in Britain has increased from 756 to 802 in five years, now holding more than 915,000 cattle.\nCampaign group Compassion in World Farming (CiWF) said the rise in large-scale cattle farming was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d as many would be intensive \"megafarms\" housing cattle all year round.\nThe NFU said it was neither farm size nor whether cattle were kept outdoors or indoors that dictated welfare but how livestock were managed. \nWhile there is no formal definition of a \u201cmegafarm\u201d in the UK, it is a term commonly used by animal welfare campaigners to describe a large-scale farm confining its livestock and using intensive farming practices.\nTo label a cattle farm as a \u201cmegafarm\u201d, the US definition of a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) is often used. A business is a CAFO if it houses 700 dairy or 1,000 beef cattle.\nThe BBC submitted a FOI request to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) which revealed that there were currently 802 farm operations in England, Wales and Scotland that held more than 700 dairy or beef cattle.\nOne farm business has a recorded capacity of up to 12,000 cattle, although any one farm may hold its cattle in smaller herds over a number of different sites.\nIn Northern Ireland, there are 141 farms with more than 700 cattle, holding a total of more than 141,000, according to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera).\nNone of the UK's devolved administrations could provide the exact number of large-scale farms using continuously housed cattle systems, which animal welfare campaigners often refer to as \"megafarms\".\nThe UK government's most recent Cattle Farm Practices Survey, published in 2019, found that 8% of larger farms in England with at least 150 cattle kept their herds indoors all year round.\nThe survey found that up to 3% of smaller farms with fewer than 150 cattle used no-graze systems.\nOne farmer, who continuously houses up to 1,000 dairy cows on one site, told the BBC he believed the current estimate of the number of farms using such \u2018no-graze' systems was \u201ctoo low\u201d.\nFraser Jones, a third-generation farmer in Powys, Wales, who has 5,000 cattle in total across seven sites, said: \u201cA lot of people are doing it but they don\u2019t always say it because they know it causes a backlash.\u201d\nMr Jones said more and more farmers were turning to such indoor systems because they protected cattle from the impacts of extreme weather and allowed greater monitoring and control of their health and nutritional intake, producing a better milk yield.\nMr Jones said the key to ensuring high animal welfare standards centred on the staff a farm employed, the training they received and how livestock was managed.\n\u201cIf you are not treating your animals right they are not going to perform. They are not going to produce enough milk. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he said.\nCIWF said the rise in cattle \"megafarms\" had \u201cgone unnoticed\u201d as many were hidden from public view.\nAnthony Field, CIWF\u2019s UK head, said of the figures obtained by the BBC's FOI request: \u201cThis deeply concerning data clearly illustrates their sheer scale and the desperate, broken, and unsustainable food system we have created.\u201d\nCritics say intensive no-graze systems can lead to poor health conditions, with disease spreading in crowded sheds and the routine overuse of antibiotics, leading to the potential growth of antimicrobial resistance.\nThe RSPCA said it was opposed to a \"move towards permanently housing cattle, whether beef or dairy\u201d.\nHowever, the NFU said that continuously housed cattle \u201cmegafarms\u201d were still not common in the UK.\nIt said there were less than 20 farms with more than 5,000 beef cattle and just a \"few farms\u201d with more than 1,000 milking cows.\nThe NFU\u2019s Vice-President, Rachel Hallos, said: \"Animal husbandry, health, welfare and adherence to established biosecurity protocols are the most important factors for good on-farm practice, not the size or type of farm system.\"\nFarm industry body the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board said the average herd size on a UK dairy farm was currently 152 cows and that the majority of large-scale farms would still be grazing cattle outdoors.\nBut Liam Sinclair, professor of animal science at Harper Adams University, said economic pressures had been forcing dairy farms to increase herd size for the past 50 years.\nThat, he said, often came with the problem of lack of available land for grazing.\n\u201cAs herds increase in size and grazing becomes more difficult to manage it is more likely that cows will remain inside continuously - and from birth,\u201d he said.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it could not comment on the business decisions of farms that chose to develop and operate large-",

    "You can lead a horse to water and, it turns out, convince it to drink if the reward is great enough, researchers have found.\nA new study has suggested horses are more intelligent than previously thought, having been observed to quickly adapt to a treat-based game with changing rules.\nResearchers from Nottingham Trent University (NTU) said they were surprised by how the horses quickly grasped the game, busting previous theories that equine brains respond only to immediate stimuli and are not complex enough to strategise.\nThe new findings could lead to more humane horse training regimes and improvements to their welfare, researchers said.\nThe study involved 20 horses, who first were rewarded with a treat for touching a piece of card with their nose.\nIn the second stage, a \"stop light\" was introduced, and the rule was changed so that the reward was only given if they touched the card while the light was off.\nThis did not alter the behaviour of the horses, as they were observed touching the card regardless of the status of the light. That is, until the rules changed for a third time.\nIn the final stage, researchers introduced a penalty of a 10-second timeout for touching the card while the stop light was on.\nThe team observed a rapid adjustment to the horses' behaviour now there was a cost to getting it wrong, all of them quickly learning to play by the rules to avoid the timeout, researchers said.\n\"We were expecting horses' performance to improve when we introduced the time-out, but were surprised by how immediate and significant the improvement was,\" lead researcher Louise Evans said.\nThe researchers believe the fact the horses adapted so quickly indicates they understood the rule of the stop light the entire time, but had no reason to follow the rule when there was no consequence for getting it wrong.\nThe study, published in the Applied Animal Behaviour Science journal shows that horses are more cognitively advanced than they are given credit for, Dr Carrie Ijichi, a senior equine researcher at NTU said.\n\"This teaches us that we shouldn't make assumptions about animal intelligence or sentience based on whether they are 'built' just like us,\" she said.",
    "Officials in Spain are investigating Katy Perry, for allegedly filming a music video in ecologically-sensitive sand dunes in the Balearic Islands without permission.\nThe video for Lifetimes shows the singer enjoying beaches and partying in clubs on the islands of Ibiza and Formentera.\nBut scenes believed to have been filmed in protected dunes on the isle of S'Espalmador have raised concern. \nA statement from the Spanish government alleged the production company responsible for the video had not sought permission. A label spokesperson for Perry said \"the local video production company assured us all necessary permits for the video were secured\" and that they had \"verbal authority\" to go ahead. \nOfficials stressed that Katy Perry was not under investigation for what it called \"crimes against the environment\", as filming can be authorised in the area.\nThe environment department of the Balearic Islands issued a press release on Tuesday, claiming that the video\u2019s production company did not secure the necessary authorisation before filming.\nAs a result, their release said, \"preliminary investigation actions have been initiated\".\nThe department drew attention to one section of the Natural Resources Management Plan, which states that \"photographic, cinematographic or videographic\" reports for an \"advertising or commercial exhibition purpose\" requires express authorisation of the ministry for the environment. \nThe video for Lifetimes includes shots of the dune system of S\u2019Espalmador, one of the most ecologically rich areas of Formentera.\nS\u2019Espalmador is an uninhabited islet located to the north of Formentera, and is approximately 1.8 miles long. \nIt has been part of the Ses Salines de Ibiza and Formentera natural park since 1980. \nThe dunes on the small, privately owned island are of \"great ecological value\", according to the regional government\u2019s tourism website.\nBBC News has contacted production company WeOwnTheCity for comment.\nA spokesperson for Perry commented: \"The local video production company assured us that all necessary permits for the video were secured.  \n\"We have since learned that one permit was in process, although we were given verbal authority to go ahead. \n\"Our local crew on July 22 applied for a permit for this specific location with the Directorate-General For Coasts And Coastline. \n\"Our crew received verbal approval on July 26 to proceed with the filming on July 27.

    "Rioters have been given prison time for their involvement in some of the worst unrest the UK has seen in over a decade. \nJudges in Liverpool, Plymouth and Teesside, among other towns and cities, handed down sentences for violent disorder sparked by the killing of three young girls in Southport 10 days ago. \nThose jailed include a 69-year-old man who armed himself with a small truncheon and a 28-year-old man who knocked a teenager off his bike with a motorbike helmet. \nThere were 21 convictions on Thursday, prosecutors said, and more rioters are facing jail in the coming days as suspects are fast-tracked to appear in court. \nFormer postmaster and school governor Steven Mailen, 54, and his partner Ryan Sheers, 29, were each handed a prison sentence of two years and two months at Teesside Crown Court on Thursday.\nMailen, of Arch Street, Hartlepool, was described as \"one of the main instigators\" of a large-scale disturbance in the town on 31 July.\nA judge said Mailen and Sheers, of Powlett Road, Hartlepool, were \"at the very forefront of the mob\". The judge said they tried to push their way through a police cordon, with Mailen taunting officers and encouraging others to use violence towards them.\nAt the same court, Kieron Gatenby, 19, was sentenced to 16 months' in a young offender institution after he was found to be part of a group throwing missiles at police and smashing the windows of houses, cars and shops while chanting racial slurs.\nThe teenager, of Yeovil Walk, Hartlepool, denied having any racist beliefs but admitted his behaviour was unacceptable.\nElsewhere, two men were jailed at Liverpool Crown Court for two years and eight months after admitting violent disorder.\nJohn O'Malley, 43, of Cambridge Gardens in Southport, was identified from footage of the violence in Southport on July 30.\nThe sentencing judge told him: \"You were at the front of what was essentially a baying mob.\"\nWilliam Nelson Morgan, of Linton Street, Walton, was jailed for his part in unrest in which police were attacked and a library was set on fire.\nThe 69-year-old admitted violent disorder and possessing an offensive weapon - a truncheon - in Liverpool on Saturday night.\nTwo brothers who looted the library community hub set ablaze by rioters were also jailed at the court.\nAdam Wharton, 28, and Ellis Wharton, 22, targeted the burned-out site but the latter was caught by an officer as he removed a large computer monitor while his older brother was a lookout.\nThe brothers, of Selwyn Street in Walton, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to burglary with intent to steal, while Ellis Wharton changed his plea on Thursday to admit assaulting an emergency worker.\nSerial criminal Adam Wharton was handed 20 months in jail and Ellis Wharton, who has no previous convictions, was given 11 months.\nAt Plymouth Crown Court on Thursday, 29-year-old Lucas Ormond Skeaping was sentenced to 18 months for violent disorder after throwing missiles and knocking a teenager off his bike with a motorbike helmet during a protest in Plymouth on Monday. \nProsecutor Lewis Aldous said the defendant, of Warran Lane, Tavistock, had a GoPro camera which captured him throwing a full 500ml bottle of Coca Cola and a rock.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said 21 convictions took place on Thursday. \nVictoria Cook, chief crown prosecutor for CPS South West, said: \"The substantial sentences handed down today should send a chilling message to those arrested, those sat in cells ahead of their court hearing and those still waiting for a knock from the police.\"\nPolice have made almost 500 arrests in connection with disorder following the Southport stabbing 10 days ago. \nSome 149 charges have been brought so far, with police expecting that number to \"rise significantly\". \nThe spate of violence is the worst the UK has experienced since 2011, when riots between 6 and 11 August across England saw looting and arson, as well as mass deployment of police and the deaths of five people.",

    "A 29-year-old woman who stabbed to death a man who \"loved and supported\" her because he ran out of money has been jailed for at least 25 years.\nLauren Harris, of no fixed address, murdered David Mark Wilcox at his flat with accomplice David Webster, who bludgeoned him with a vodka bottle.\nWebster, 43, of Lacey Street, Widnes, Cheshire, was jailed for at least 23 years after the pair were convicted last week. \nMr Justice Pepperall told Harris at Mold Crown Court the killing of the 65-year-old, who \"had loved and supported you,\u201d was \"brutal and senseless\".\nA third man, Thomas Whitely, 33, of Colwyn Bay, had also been charged with murder but was cleared.\nThe jury heard that North Wales Police went to a property in Bay View Road, near Colwyn Bay town centre, in Conwy county, where Mr Wilcox was found stabbed and battered to death in an armchair.\nHe had been punched, kicked and stamped on and had broken ribs.\nDuring sentencing Mr Justice Pepperall said: \"I detect no remorse.\"\nAt one point as she was led into the dock Harris sang Shania Twain's Man!

    "In the Saudi city of Jeddah on Wednesday, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a group of 57 countries, held an emergency meeting at Iran\u2019s request to discuss, among other things, the assassination of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week.\nThe gathering was an opportunity for Iran, whose Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed \u201charsh punishment\u201d for the killing, to lay out the reasons for an expected retaliation. \nBoth Iran and Hamas say the 31 July assassination was carried out by Israel, which has not commented but is widely believed to have been behind it.\nBaqeri Ali Bagheri Kani, the acting Iranian foreign minister, said his country had \u201cno choice\u201d but to respond, and that this would take place \u201cat the right time and in the appropriate shape\u201d. \nMr Kani also described the possible Iranian reaction as \u201cnot only a defence of its own sovereignty and national security\u201d but also a \u201cdefence of the stability and security of the entire region\u201d.\nHaniyeh was killed in a heavily protected guesthouse run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran\u2019s elite military force, as he visited Tehran for the inauguration of the country\u2019s new President Masoud Pezeshkian, a humiliating breach of Iranian security.\nSince then, every sign, speech, or statement from Iran has been closely watched for an indication of how and when it might respond, amid concerns the retaliation could lead to a wider conflict with Israel. \nBut Mr Kani offered no clues and, with apparent limited intelligence by the West, it remains unclear what Iran could be planning to do.\nIn April, a strike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital, Damascus, killed eight IRGC officers, another attack believed to have been carried out by Israel - and another embarrassing setback for Iran. \nAfter days of telegraphing its intentions, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel; almost all of them were intercepted by Israel and a US-led coalition, and the retaliation had no significant impact.\nLast week, American officials suggested that this time, Iran might have been preparing a bigger operation, perhaps in attempt to avoid repeating that failure. \nRecent media reports, however, suggest that details of how Haniyeh\u2019s killing was carried out \u2013 possibly from inside Iran with local assistance instead of a precise air strike from outside \u2013 combined with the fact that no Iranians were killed and diplomatic efforts from Western and Arab countries, might have forced Tehran to reconsider its plans.\nThe Jordanian foreign minister made a rare visit to Iran earlier this week and, on Wednesday, the French President, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to Mr Pezeshkian and, according to the French presidency, urged him to \u201cdo everything to avoid a new military escalation\u201d.\nMeanwhile, there is also the wait for another expected attack on Israel, from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political movement in Lebanon. \nThe group has vowed to respond to the killing by Israel of senior commander Fuad Shukr, which happened just hours before Haniyeh\u2019s assassination, in its stronghold of Dahiya, in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs.\nConcerns of a major conflict in Lebanon are at their highest since Hezbollah stepped up its strikes against Israel, a day after the Hamas attacks on 7 October. \nMost of the violence has been contained to areas along the Lebanon-Israel border, with both Hezbollah and Israel still indicating they are not interested in an all-out war. \nSo far, the group has mainly targeted Israeli military facilities, although its attacks are increasingly more sophisticated and hitting positions deeper inside the country.\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who has promised a \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d response, described Shukr as one of the \u201cstrategic minds of the resistance\u201d and said they had spoken on the phone an hour before his assassination. \nIn the past, Hezbollah retaliated to the killings of top commanders by launching barrages of rockets at Israel. Having such a high-profile figure assassinated in their base in the Lebanese capital will likely result in a more symbolic response, although almost certain to be within what the group describes as the rules of engagement.\nIn Lebanon, where people still remember the devastation caused by the 2006 war between the Hezbollah and Israel, many fear they are being dragged into a conflict that is not in the nation\u2019s interest. But a damaged Hezbollah is not in Iran\u2019s interest either. With its precision guided missiles and attack drones, Hezbollah is a key element of Iran\u2019s deterrence, right on Israel\u2019s borders. \nIsrael sees the Iranian nuclear programme as an existential threat, and Hezbollah would probably play a vital role in Iran\u2019s response if its facilities came under Israeli attack.\nHezbollah is the main group in the so-called Axis of Resistance, an Iranian-backed alliance across the region that includes the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq, which have also carried ",

    "As a child, Dr Karen Gardiner always wanted to be a vet but it was a dream she never fulfilled. \nInstead she pursued her love of animals through the academic subject of zoology and later a PHD in marine mammals.   \nHowever, her two daughters have both chosen to become vets and Dr Gardiner could not be prouder.  \nHaving managed to help them to vet school, she was inspired to start up Future Vets Scotland to help other parents and would-be vets navigate their way to that career.\nIt\u2019s a timely initiative.  \nCurrently there is a shortage of vets across the country but it is particularly acute in the most rural and remote areas.     \n\u201cA lack of vets will impact everyone who consumes Scottish farm produce or owns a pet,\" Dr Gardiner says.\n\"And there has been an exponential rise in pet ownership especially after Covid.\"\nSheila Voas, the chief veterinary officer for Scotland, believes the serious shortage of vets is exacerbating the sheer amount of on-call work expected in some practices.  \nThat means some vets are leaving the profession early or others are deterred from considering it as a career.   \nShe says it is all about going into it with your eyes open and picking the kind of practice that best suits you.  \n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a better time to apply to vet school,\" Ms Voas says.  \n\"Even if your high school doesn\u2019t offer three sciences at advanced level, actually if you make that clear on your application, it can be taken into account during the application process.\"\nShe believes giving school-leavers a realistic view of what the profession can offer is key to getting these places filled by students who will have long, fulfilling careers.\nThat is exactly what the latest initiative by Future Vets Scotland is trying to do.  \nThis week saw its first ever camp for 16 and 17 year olds from all around Scotland, who are thinking of becoming vets when they leave school.  \nThe 46 teenagers, who all applied to take part, were able to get hands-on experience of what life as a vet might be like.  \nBased at Scotland\u2019s Rural College site in West Lothian, they were out in the fields with goats and alpacas.  \nThere was even a practical lesson in how to help a large animal like an injured horse.    \nDr Gardiner says it has also been about giving them the confidence and connections with the vet schools, who sent instructors, and the chance to meet others their own age thinking of  the same path.  \nShe says: \"That is enormously helpful since they are likely to be the only one in their school who is choosing to be a vet.\"\nAmong those taking part was 17-year-old Emily from Renfrewshire. \nShe says getting up at 02:00 to help out a struggling animal in a cold barn is not daunting.\n\"You know you are going to make an impact on the farmer and the animal\u2019s life by helping them, that\u2019s just part of the job,\" she says\nAnother young prospective vet, 16-year-old Millie, travelled to the camp from Islay.  \nShe already has her own ponies and helps out on her grandfather\u2019s farm.\nMillie says: \"I would be happy to become a vet and go back home to Islay, it\u2019s a really nice place to live.\u201d\nShe would no doubt be welcomed back with open arms by the farmers and pet owners of that most rural of communities.",
    "A collision between a Ryanair plane and an airport passenger assistance truck may have been caused by the vehicle driver being tired and distracted, an investigation has found.\nThe crash happened when the Boeing 737-8AS, which had right of way, turned towards an aircraft stand following an inbound flight at Stansted Airport, Essex, on 4 October.\nThe driver of the ground vehicle, who was heading towards a different stand, may have suffered \"inattentional blindness\", which is when someone fails to notice an unexpected object in clear sight, a report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said.\nBoth the vehicle operator and the airport authority issued safety notices to drivers regarding safe driving practices.\nMore than 100 passengers and six crew were onboard the Ryanair aircraft when its right wing collided with the roof of the SideBull Ambulift vehicle, causing visible damage to both.\nAnalysis of CCTV footage from inside the vehicles during the moments before the collision found the driver made \"no obvious glances\" through the left window towards the plane, and only appeared to notice it about five seconds after it started to turn.\nHe performed an emergency stop and began to reverse, but was unable to get out of the way.\nNo-one was injured.\nThe AAIB found the driver had been involved in a collision with another vehicle six weeks earlier.\nThe report stated: \"The driver was relatively inexperienced in the airport environment and his account and history suggested that he found it challenging.\n\"The driver reported that it had been a busy morning and he felt annoyed about the way that jobs were allocated.\n\"Although the number of tasks was consistent with the time of year and not unusually high, this individual driver was potentially feeling fatigued by the workload that day and distracted by his emotional response to the last-minute tasking.\n\"These factors may have reduced his performance.\"\nThe report added: \"The inattentional blindness phenomenon may account for the driver not seeing [the plane] even when it was clearly visible.\"\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Newborn twins were reportedly killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza while their father was at a local government office to register their birth.\nAsser, a boy, and Ayssel, a girl, were just four days old when their father Mohammed Abu al-Qumsan went to collect their birth certificates.\nWhile he was away, his neighbours called to say their home in Deir al Balah had been bombed.\nThe strike also killed his wife and the twins' grandmother.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI am told it was a shell that hit the house.\u201d\n\"I didn't even have the time to celebrate them,\" he added.\nGaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry says 115 infants have been born and then killed during the war.\nAccording to AP news agency, the family had followed an order to evacuate Gaza City in the opening weeks of the Israel-Gaza war, seeking shelter in a central part of the strip, as the Israeli army instructed.\nThe BBC has asked the Israeli army for comment on the strike, and is waiting for a response.\nIsrael says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas operating in dense residential areas, including using civilian buildings as shelter.\nBut officials rarely comment on individual strikes.\nSeveral such shelters in Gaza have been attacked in the past few weeks.\nOn Saturday, an Israeli air strike on a school building sheltering displaced Palestinians in Gaza City killed more than 70 people, the director of a hospital told the BBC.\nAn Israeli military spokesman said the school \"served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility\", which Hamas denied.\nIsrael disputed the number of dead, but the BBC could not independently verify figures from either side.\nHamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.\nThat attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war.\nMore than 39,790 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nUpdate 16 August: This article\u2019s headline originally explained that newborn twins were killed in Gaza as their father went to register their birth. It was amended to a longer headline emphasising the fact that their father said they had been killed in an Israeli strike.",
    "Greenwich Council has suggested it may not be able to afford its share of funding towards the proposed DLR extension to Thamesmead in south-east London. \nThe authority has been negotiating with the mayor of London in an attempt to bring down the bill, which will be shared with Newham Council and Transport for London (TfL). \nNewham Council documents revealed last year the construction of the project could cost up to \u00a31.7bn.\nTfL has said up to 30,000 new homes and 10,000 new jobs could be provided in Newham and Greenwich boroughs from the scheme and it \"presents a crucial opportunity to boost connectivity by linking two major growth areas\".\nTfL launched a consultation in February and March on plans to extend the DLR from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead via Beckton Riverside.\nHowever, at a transport and place scrutiny meeting on 25 July, Greenwich Council's cabinet member for transport, Averil Lekau, suggested council finances could hinder the planned extension.\nMs Lekau told the meeting: \u201cWe are, I would have to say, being asked to front a considerable amount of money [alongside] Newham and both authorities are concerned that we would just not be able to do that, so we\u2019re still negotiating with the mayor and the government to see how that goes.\u201d\nShe added that a business case for the extension had been put forward to central government and discussions were ongoing.\nA Newham Council spokesperson told the Local Democracy Reporting Service the authority and its partners were still\u00a0at an early stage of the extension project\u2019s development.\nThey said a lot of design work was still needed alongside identifying funding sources for the scheme\u2019s construction.\nThe spokesperson added: \"We welcome future discussions with central government on this, which is in addition to ongoing discussions with TfL and our borough and private-sector partners. \n\"We have not been formally asked to commit funding at present.\u201d\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan hinted in May that Belvedere could also benefit from an additional extension of the DLR in the future.\nA spokesperson later confirmed that the Thamesmead project would be designed in such a way to allow the opportunity for further extensions.\nAlex Williams, TfL's chief customer and strategy officer, said: \u201cWe will now progress work on plans for the cross-river extension of the DLR, which could see customers benefit from the early 2030s, and continue to discuss funding options with all parties.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the mayor said it would \"unlock huge opportunities for London, support tens of thousands of new homes, deliver new transport connections and boost the economy\".\nThey added: \u201cThe mayor and TfL are working with councils, development partners and the government to secure the funding needed for this vital project, which will help build a better, more prosperous London for everyone.\u201d\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "At least 32 children have died during student protests that engulfed Bangladesh last month, the UN's children's agency has said.\nThe youngest child killed had yet to turn five years old, a Unicef spokesperson said, adding that most of those who died were bystanders.\nThey were among more than 200 people who were killed during demonstrations against job quotas in the civil service, according to figures verified by BBC Bangla.\nThe quota system has now been scaled back by the government following a Supreme Court ruling, but students have continued protesting - now demanding justice for those who died or have been injured or detained.\nWhile the protests are now smaller in scale, the government is struggling to control the rising tide of anger over how it initially responded to the demonstrations.\n\"Why are our brothers in graves and the killers outside?\" asked a crowd which had gathered outside the largest mosque in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, following Friday prayers, according to the AFP news agency.\nSecurity forces responded to the thousands who filled the streets with tear gas and rubber bullets, according to Reuters news agency. It reported that at least 20 people were injured.\nSanjay Wijesekera, Unicef's regional director for south Asia, said he had been made aware of reports of children being detained during a visit to Bangladesh this week.\nHe added that the 32 deaths the organisation had confirmed were \"a terrible loss\". \nA spokesperson for the UN agency said most of those killed were aged 13 or older, with one under five and one child aged between six and 12.\n\"Children must be protected at all times,\" Mr Wijesekera said. \"That is everyone\u2019s responsibility.\"\nBangladeshi junior Information Minister Mohammad Ali Arafat responded that the government had no information regarding Unicef's death toll.\n\"We don\u2019t know where they [Unicef] got the numbers from,\" he told the BBC, adding: \"Our position is clear: Whoever has been killed, we are going to investigate and bring the perpetrators to book.\"\nSecurity forces have been accused of using excessive force to quell the initial protests, with many of the dead and injured suffering gunshot wounds, according to doctors who spoke to the BBC.\nBut the government - which has said a number of police officers were also killed -  has blamed political opponents for the unrest. \nOn Thursday, it banned the country's main Islamist party - Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir - which it claimed was behind some of the violence.\n\"We have evidence that they have participated in the killings and in the destruction of government and private properties,\" Anisul Huq, Bagladesh's law minister, told the BBC. \nThe opposition party's leader described the move as \"illegal, extrajudicial and unconstitutional\".\nLeaders of the student protest were also detained for a week - something done for their own protection, officials claimed. However, their release on Thursday has done little to dampen the outrage.\nIn a joint statement released on Friday, the students questioned the grounds on which they were held.\nThe group alleged \"harassment, torture and drama\" towards them and their families during their seven days of detention.\n\"No one is safe in the custody of those who kill unarmed students and citizens,\" the statement said, as it urged people to continue taking to the streets.\nNearly 10,000 people have reportedly been detained since the authorities began their crackdown on the protests.\nBut Mr Arafat rebuffed the statement by the student leaders.\nHe said the authorities had to take the student leaders into custody because the government was aware of a potential threat to their lives. \n\"Their protection became our top priority,\" he added.",
    "William Hui has been fascinated with public transportation for as long as he can remember. \nSo it only made sense that the 40-year-old systems engineer would challenge himself to travel from his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, to Tijuana, Mexico, solely on public buses and trains.\nOn 24 June, Mr Hui set out to do just that, taking a nine-day journey along the US Pacific coast.\nMr Hui told the BBC he only had a few rules for his trip: absolutely no Greyhound buses or Amtrak trains were allowed, and walking between bus stops had to be kept to a minimum.\n\u201cAt no point in this trip did I have to walk more than maybe 15 minutes from one bus stop to another,\u201d he told the BBC on Friday.\n\u201cIt was just remarkable to see how the different services connected, especially in rural areas,\u201d he added.\nThis was not the first time Mr Hui set out on an unusual journey. \nIn 2013, he tried to travel as far south from Vancouver as he could, but only made it to Salem, Oregon.\n\u201cI wanted to go further, I just couldn\u2019t because there was no transit pretty much crossing Oregon into central California,\u201d Mr Hui said.\nBut earlier this year, he learned of a new, four-hour bus route that links Eureka, a city in northern California, to another city named Ukiah, about two hours north of San Francisco.\nHe called that route \u201cthe missing link\u201d, which finally allowed him to make the journey all the way to Mexico more than a decade later.\nMr Hui said a lot has changed from that initial trip, including how more public transit buses now are equipped with WiFi and accept credit or debit card payments.\nSome, however, still only accept cash. \u201cI went to the currency exchange before I set out on this journey and asked for 50 $1 bills just so I had exact change,\u201d he said.\nAnother thing Mr Hui noted was the difference between public transport in bigger cities, like Seattle or San Francisco, and smaller rural areas, where one bus would travel several hours to link people over the span of hundreds of kilometres.\nWhen it came to international borders, Mr Hui said he crossed them by foot.\nAt the US-Canada border, he said he was met with scepticism by border agents as he tried to explain the purpose of his journey.\n\u201cThere are not that many people who cross the (northern) border by foot,\u201d Mr Hui said.\nBy contrast, he noticed a more well-travelled route between San Diego, in California, and Tijuana, Mexico, and generally more foot traffic at the southern border.\nIn all, Mr Hui spent a total of about $200 (\u00a3157) on bus tickets. But the views along the way, he said, were priceless.\n\u201cI was absolutely amazed by the Oregon coastline when I passed through central Oregon,\u201d he said, and was also \u201cawestruck by the redwoods\u201d as he travelled through northern California.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve been saying this to folks who have asked: I was really there for the journey, not so much the destination,\u201d he said. \nMr Hui, who works at TransLink - the transportation authority in Vancouver - said his fascination with public transport stems from his appreciation of the \u201clogistics puzzle\u201d behind transit systems that allow buses and trains to get to their intended destinations on time.\nHe added that he enjoys the novelty of experiencing a new system of public transport, and the role these systems play in helping connect people from one place to another.\n\u201cOne thing that struck me on this trip is how important transit is to the communities it serves,\u201d Mr Hui said.\n\u201cAt no point was I alone on the bus for extended periods of time,\u201d he said.\nAnother thing that surprised Mr Hui is the minimal delays throughout his trip.\n\u201cThat was the amazing part,\u201d he said. Even with the notoriously lengthy Los Angeles traffic, Mr Hui said he had enough time to make his next connection and did not have to resort to any back-up plans.\nFor anyone who wants to set out on a similar journey, Mr Hui advised to research ahead of time and to pack light since there are typically no luggage racks or baggage space available.\nHe added that it is good to also plan out bathroom breaks. \n\u201cShopping centres, libraries, community centers, those are great places to find a washroom during a short stop,\u201d Mr Hui said.\nAnd perhaps the most important tip: \u201cKnow when the bus comes.\u201d",
    "A former Colorado county election official was found guilty on Monday of tampering with voting machines after the 2020 presidential election. \nA jury found former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a Republican, guilty on seven out of 10 counts in the election interference case. \nPeters has become well known among election deniers who falsely believe the 2020 presidential election was rigged against former President Donald Trump. \nPeters pleaded not guilty to all counts in 2022. \nThe case represents the first time a local election official has been prosecuted over a suspected security breach during the 2020 election. \n\"Tina Peters willfully compromised her own election equipment trying to prove Trump's Big Lie,\" Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement.\n\"Today's verdict sends a clear message: we will not tolerate any effort to threaten the security of our gold standard elections,\" she added. \nThe jury deliberated for over four hours on Monday before returning the verdict. Four of the seven charges Peters was found guilty on are felonies. \nThe former county clerk was convicted of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.\nProsecutors say Peters engaged in \"a deceptive scheme which was designed to influence public servants, breach security protocols, exceed permissible access to voting equipment and set in motion the eventual distribution of confidential information to unauthorized people,\" according to the indictment. \nProsecutors said Peters helped breach the county's election computer systems and allowed an unauthorized individual to access voting equipment and election records. The person posted secure election equipment images online. \nPeters became \"fixated\" on voting problems after the 2020 presidential election that some falsely believe was rigged against Trump, prosecutors said. \nInvestigators also issued a search warrant for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a proponant of election fraud claims, in connection to Peters' case, BBC's American partner CBS News reported. \nPeters is set to be sentenced on 3 October. Her attorney could not be reached for comment. ",
    "The video begins with loud bangs on a door that leads to a dimly lit stairwell.\n\u201cThey are entering my home arbitrarily. They are destroying the door,\u201d a woman can be heard crying.\nIt is the voice of Mar\u00eda Oropeza, a campaign co-ordinator for opposition coalition Vente Venezuela, who is live streaming her detention on Instagram.\nThe bangs increase in intensity as she tells her followers that she has done nothing wrong: \u201cI am not a criminal.\u201d\nOfficials from Venezuela\u2019s military counterintelligence agency then burst through her door and the video cuts to black.\nMs Oropeza is the latest opposition figure who has been detained following the announcement in the early hours of 29 July of Venezuela\u2019s disputed presidential election result.\nIn the days since, members of the security forces have seized Freddy Superlano and Roland Carre\u00f1o \u2013 both of whom worked for the opposition party Popular Will \u2013 and Ricardo Est\u00e9vez, a technical adviser for the same opposition movement as Ms Oropeza.\nAmnesty International told the BBC they had \u201cwell-founded reasons to believe [the detained people's] lives and integrity are at risk\u201d.\nThe pressure group says that they have been seeing a new pattern of more targeted arrests by the Venezuelan authorities since the election.\nMany of those detained have reportedly not been told why they were being arrested.\nIn the live stream of Ms Oropeza\u2019s detention, she can be heard asking those banging on her door if they have a search warrant. She receives no answer.\nTension has been high since Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council declared President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro the winner of the election - a declaration that was immediately dismissed by the opposition, which said it had proof that it, not the government had won. Mass anti-government protests quickly followed.\nPresident Maduro accused the opposition of instigating a \u201ccoup\u201d and announced plans to build two new maximum-security prisons to house protesters it accuses of being \u201ccriminal fascists\u201d.\nThe government says more than 2,000 people have been detained, some of which it accuses of \u201cterrorism\u201d.\nClara del Campo, Amnesty International\u2019s Americas senior campaigner, said the arbitrary detentions had followed a \u201ctwo-pronged trend\u201d.\n\u201cOn the one hand, they have been massive and indiscriminate when it comes to protesters who took to the streets to support the opposition\u2019s claim to election victory and, on the other, targeted and selected towards human rights defenders and opposition members,\u201d she explained.\nAccording to Ms del Campo, the mass detention of protesters is aimed at punishing and dissuading people from publicly expressing dissent.\nIt is an observation echoed by Venezuelan human rights NGO Foro Penal, which told BBC Mundo that it had witnessed an unprecedented \u201cescalation of repression\u201d.\nForo Penal has received reports of people who had their phones checked arbitrarily while they were walking down the street, with the security officials stopping them citing social media posts or messages as the reason for their subsequent arrest.\nThe NGO told the BBC that people arrested in this manner have typically been held in detention centres without access to independent lawyers.\nThese detentions have led to a culture of fear, with some people now worried about sharing information on social media, attending protests, or even raising the alarm about people who have been seized for fear of punishment.\nPresident Maduro himself has spoken of a strategy he called \u201cOperation Tun Tun\u201d (Operation Knock Knock).\nRights groups say it consists of the authorities going door-to-door to detain those with links to the protests or the opposition.\nMore than 2,000 have been detained since the election, according to government figures. Amnesty International says that among them are more than 100 children aged between 13 and 17 and at least six people with disabilities.\nMs Del Campo said those detained were \u201clargely accused of \u2018terrorism\u2019 and related crimes, denied legal defence, remain disappeared and incommunicado, and are at high risk of ill treatment\u201d.\nShe also said that human rights defenders and members of the opposition had been specifically targeted so as to \u201ccurtail political participation and the protection of rights\u201d.\nOne of them is Kennedy Tejeda - a young pro-bono human rights lawyer with Foro Penal - who was arrested as he was trying to assist other people detained for protesting.\nAs well as implementing its \u201cOperation Knock Knock\u201d, the authorities have also targeted activists and opposition members in other ways.\nThe BBC has been told about dozens of people, including journalists and activists, whose passports have been revoked.\nEdni L\u00f3pez, a university professor and humanitarian worker who assisted many NGOs in Venezuela, was detained on the morning of 4 August at the international airport in the capital, Caracas.\nShe was planning to board a flight to Colombia from where she was going to fly to Argentina for a holiday with friends.\nShe last contacted her fri",

    "An Afghan asylum seeker, who was inside a hotel targeted by rioters, said people were \"traumatised\" by what happened and described feeling \"lost\" about his future.\nThe 29-year-old man was in the Holiday Inn Express at Manvers near Rotherham when people smashed the windows of the building and started fires.\nMasked men hurled wood, chairs and bottles and some sprayed fire extinguishers at police officers amid the 700-strong crowd.\nOn Sunday, South Yorkshire Police said 18 people had been charged in connection with the incident on Sunday 4 August in which 10 officers were injured, with one knocked unconscious.\nThe asylum seeker, who did not want to be identified because of concerns for his safety, said the trouble had been preceded a day earlier with people passing the hotel and shouting abuse. \nThe man, who had been in the hotel for two months waiting for his asylum claim to be processed, described the fear and panic when the attack began.\n\"They entered from the back/kitchen to the dining area and broke the windows from the inside,\" he said.\n\"From the inside they threw chairs and tables onto the police and were throwing other things at the police.\n\"And then they started the fire. People were really scared inside the hotel.\"\nOne week on, and having been moved to another hotel, he said the fear had not subsided.\n\"I am pretty sure most of the people who were in the hotel are still in a kind of panic,\" he said. \n\"They are traumatised, they are not in a good situation.\"\nThe man had been in the UK for a year and a half as a student, but applied for asylum earlier this year, feeling he would not be able to return to his home country due to the Taliban takeover.\n\"I had a great life back in Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\"I was working with humanitarian organisations and in the development sector. I was also working as a volunteer.\"\nHe said having to leave his own country was not an easy thing and forced migration was neither good nor desirable.\nThe man, who has been supported by the Refugee Council, said he had hoped for a positive new life in the UK before the riots broke out and his experience had been \"very happy\" and safe until then.\n\"Now I don't go outside,\" he said. \"I don't want to explore new places. I feel very sad and frustrated. I feel very lost now.\"\nNooralhaq Nasimi, director of the Afghanistan and Central Asian Association (ACAA), said the people he supports were \"anxious and scared\" for the future.\nMr Nasimi arrived in the UK in 1999 from Afghanistan as a refugee and said he had never seen violence here \"on this large scale\".\nThe community leader, who was recognised in the 2023 New Year Honours for services to refugees, said he believed those behind the violence were \"a very small minority\".\nMr Nasimi said he felt \"very pleased to see so many British people go out into the streets to support the multiculturalism of Britain, telling the public that those people who are behind this violence they are not representing British democracy or culture\".\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "The developer behind a new arena in Derby has urged the government to bring the headquarters of Great British Railways (GBR) to brownfield land in the city centre. \nPaul Morris, from St James Securities, told the BBC he is bidding to bring the offices to the Becketwell area of the city, a once derelict six-acre site that his firm is redeveloping for the city council.\nBut he said central sites like Midland House or the soon-to-be-demolished Assembly Rooms would also be of greater benefit to the city than somewhere further out of town.\nThe Department for Transport, which oversees GBR, declined to comment.\nMr Morris said bringing GBR to Becketwell would encourage other firms to come back into the centre of Derby.\n\"I'm putting a strong argument forward, which we will really work hard with the government [on], that any requirement should come into the city centre,\" he said.\n\"Bringing that number of people will regenerate the city, particularly the footfall - the amount of people who are working actually will spend money in the city.\n\"If GBR does come to Becketwell, we intend to build a bigger office than just their requirement which will enable other office occupiers to come back into the centre.\n\"I've had a lot of discussions with businesses, many of whom are over in Pride Park, I said they needed to come back into the centre for the benefit of the city and actually it would be really good for your employees.\n\"Their stock answer, which is quite right at the moment, is there isn't any available grade A space.\u201d\nIn May 2021, former transport secretary Grant Shapps announced GBR would be set up to replace what he called an \"overcomplicated and fragmented\" system.\nAfter a lengthy process, Derby beat five other towns and cities to be the headquarters of the body, which will oversee rail transport in Great Britain.\nThe selection criteria included alignment with transport connections, railway heritage, and value for money.\nGBR was due to be launched in early 2024, but the implementation date was delayed by the previous Conservative government.\nLabour confirmed after winning the July 2024 election it would proceed with creating the new organisation.\nMr Morris said the scale of GBR's presence in Derby \"may well increase\" after the new Labour government pledged to renationalise most rail services within five years.\nCouncillor Paul Hezelgrave, deputy leader of Derby City Council, said: \"We're looking forward to welcoming Great British Railways to Derby and seeing the benefits that this move will bring, including more investment and jobs in our city.\n\"The Great British Railways Transition Team have recently conducted a comprehensive property search across the city, and we await the outcome of this.\n\"Creating more jobs in the city centre is a key part of our regeneration plan. The supply of grade A office space is a key challenge that we are working hard to address.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Some patients may now be treated outside Cornwall.\nThe Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said admissions to its psychiatric intensive care unit had been paused \"regrettably\".\nThe board said the measures were temporary to allow works to be \"undertaken as safely as possible\".\nAn independent fire safety review for the hospital identified issues which meant planned works needed to be brought forward.\nThe trust's chief medical officer Dr Adrian Flynn said work was already underway.\nHe said: \"We have taken immediate action to ensure the safety of patients and staff and we are doing all we can to minimise disruption while the issues are fixed. \n\"Unfortunately, owing to the scale of the works, we have had to relocate some services - as a result, some patients have been moved and are receiving their care elsewhere. \n\"This is not the experience we want for our patients.\" \nThe hospital, which is owned by G H Bodmin Limited and managed by Grosvenor Facilities Management, provides NHS community and mental health services.\nNHS bosses said they are working with partners to mitigate disruption and to \"minimise the impact on patients and their families\".\n\nNorth Cornwall politician Ben Maguire said he had been assured by the trust that disruption would be kept \"to an absolute minimum\" and that \"no NHS money\" would be used towards repairs.\n\"I absolutely appreciate that people being treated further away from home than usual or outside of Cornwall is far from ideal,\" he said.\nMr Maguire said he would make sure residents continued to \"receive the treatment and services they need whilst the maintenance works to fix the problems are carried out\".\nA spokesperson from the Integrated Care Board said the continuity for patients and staff was a priority, and health leaders were working to \"mitigate the loss of community beds and minimise the number of people treated out of area\".\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "South Korean technology tycoon, Kim Beom-su, who is also known as Brian Kim, has been indicted on charges of stock price manipulation.\nKakao executives led by Mr Kim have been accused of buying large amounts of shares in K-pop agency SM Entertainment to inflate its stock price and undermine a competing offer to take over the company.\nMr Kim, who founded the internet giant Kakao, has been in detention since being arrested just over two weeks ago.\nIn a statement around the time of his arrest, Kakao said Mr Kim did not order or tolerate any illegal activity.\nThe Seoul Southern District Prosecutors\u2019 Office indicted Mr Kim on allegations that he broke financial market rules.\nThe trial date will be set at a later stage, according to local reports.\nThe charges are related to a bidding war that came ahead of Kakao buying a controlling stake in K-pop agency SM Entertainment of almost 40% in March last year.\nProsecutors allege Mr Kim was involved in a four-day buying spree of SM Entertainment shares aimed to push up its stock market valuation beyond the reach of a rival bidder Hybe, the agency behind K-pop superstars BTS. \nThe case has sent shockwaves through South Korea's technology industry, which has long seen Mr Kim as a visionary internet pioneer.\nHe is the most high profile tech executive to be placed behind bars in South Korea since Samsung Electronics chairman Lee Jae-yong served 18 months in prison after being convicted in 2017 on bribery charges.\nMr Kim's rise from humble beginnings to become a multi-billionaire has made him hugely popular in a country where a few family-run corporations, known as chaebols, control much of the economy.\nHe is credited with founding and expanding Kakao, which is now one of South Korea's most successful internet businesses.\nKakao runs South Korea's largest messaging app, along with a growing list of other online businesses that include gaming, shopping and banking.\nIn 2022, a Kakao outage caused by a fire that damaged its servers raised concerns about how reliant the country had become on the technology giant's services.\nJust hours before Mr Kim's indictment was announced, Kakao reported operating profits of 134 billion won for the second quarter of the year, an 18.5% increase from the same period last year.\nAdditional reporting by Jake Kwon in Seoul",

    "The chief of Buckinghamshire Fire & Rescue Service has said she is \"really pleased\" with the \"really good progress\" it has made since inspectors placed it under special supervision last November.\nChief Fire Officer Louise Harrison was talking to the BBC after a recent follow-up visit from inspectors.\nAlthough the authority, which also covers Milton Keynes, remains under special supervision, inspectors praised it for taking \"significant steps\" towards improvement.\nMs Harrison was appointed after His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services made the authority one of three in England that they were monitoring closely last year.\nAt the time, inspectors said the service had failed to identify those most at risk from fire, ensure teams prioritised work according to risk, and improve equality.\nIn May they paid a follow-up visit to the service's Aylesbury headquarters, and earlier this week published the results of that.\nMs Harrison said the inspectors' update was \"a fair and accurate picture of where we're at\" and \"reflects the really, really good progress we're making and the hard work our team has done\".\nShe hoped the authority would be out of enhanced monitoring soon, and added: \"There are no quick wins and inspectors want the reassurance what we're doing is sustainable and will continue to work.\"\nInspectors praised the service for \"making good progress to improve the way it promotes equality, diversity and inclusion\".\nA recent recruitment drive has seen seven candidates taken on who are expected to start in September.\nMs Harrison said: \"Having a diverse workforce brings in a richness of perspective and it's really important that, as a public sector service, we reflect the communities we serve.\"\nNine months into the job, Ms Harrison was also keen to look to the future.\nShe told the BBC: \"We can't take our foot off the gas and need to maintain and continue our improvement journey.\"\nShe added that the authority was \"already beginning a new community risk management plan that will lead us and the service into the next five years, so there's lots of stuff being done\".\nWhen she was appointed, the Fire Brigades Union said it was \"deeply concerned\" because of her lack of firefighting experience.\nBut Ms Harrison said she thought she had a good relationship with the FBU now.\n\"I speak regularly with them and we want the same things, pretty much.

    "A Pakistani man with ties to Iran has been charged over an alleged plot to assassinate US politicians and officials.\nFBI director Christopher Wray called the scheme a \"dangerous murder-for-hire plot... straight out of the Iranian playbook\".\nAsif Merchant, 46, is accused of attempting to hire a hitman in New York to kill prominent American officials. CBS, the BBC's news partner, quoted sources as saying Donald Trump was among the targets.\nSecurity for the Republican presidential nominee was increased in June after authorities learned of an Iranian plot to kill him.\n\"A foreign-directed plot to kill a public official, or any US citizen, is a threat to our national security and will be met with the full might and resources of the FBI,\" Mr Wray said on Tuesday.\nMr Merchant was arrested in July and is being held in New York.\nAccording to the justice department's indictment, Mr Merchant arrived in the US from Pakistan in April after having spent time in Iran.\nAfter arriving, he allegedly contacted a person whom he believed could help with the assassination plot. That unnamed contact later reported Mr Merchant to the police.\nMr Merchant allegedly made a \"finger gun\" motion with his hand when talking about what he wanted to do.\nThe indictment said the job would not be a \"one-time opportunity\" and that contacts services would be needed on an ongoing basis.\nMr Merchant allegedly told the contact he planned to leave the US before targets were killed, and that he would stay in contact using code words. \nThe suspect asked the contact to arrange a meeting with would-be assassins, the indictment says. The contact then connected him in June to undercover FBI agents posing as hitmen.\nMr Merchant allegedly told the agents they were to steal documents from the home of a target, arrange protests at political rallies, and kill a \"political person\".\nAccording to the indictment, Mr Merchant said the targets would be communicated in the last week of August or the first week of September.\nWhile the indictment does not mention Trump by name, sources cited by CBS said that the former president was one of the intended targets.\nThe plot is unrelated to the assassination attempt on the former president at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on 13 July, by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper on site.\nTrump and officials including his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have faced threats from Tehran since ordering the drone strike assassination of Qassim Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds force, in Iraq in 2020.",

    "The rate cut has come at last.\nThis is more than just the Bank of England cutting its base interest rate for the first time in four years.\nThe cut will be seen as an important staging post as the economy starts to turn the corner on years of inflationary shocks. \nIt is opportune timing for the new chancellor and government, with a strong pound helping contain some inflationary pressures from imports.\nThere will be some relief for many homeowners and movers, although most are now stuck on fixed-rate mortgages and are likely to face much higher rates when these deals expire over the next few years. \nBusinesses can start to anticipate cheaper investment funding. The government borrowing forecasts should start to improve. \nRachel Reeves might dare to believe that consumer confidence could start to turn positive.\nIt was a narrow vote in favour, as the dynamic I pointed to in June materialised. \nA group of three committee members, led by Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, switched their vote from hold to cut, giving a 5-4 majority in favour, versus 7-2 against in June. One of the members who voted to hold, Jonathan Haskel, will also be replaced by the next meeting. \nThe key split on the rate-setting committee is between those who think that with inflation at target it is appropriate to slightly reduce the squeeze on the economy, and others who still fear there will be enduring inflationary scars from the recent energy and food price shocks.\nThe clear message today was not to expect a series of consecutive cuts from hereon. \nWhile there may be scope for a further reduction this year below 5%, perhaps in November, the governor wants to avoid cutting \u201ctoo quickly or by too much\u201d. \nInflation is expected to creep back up from the target of 2% over the next few months. Service inflation remains high, as do wage settlements, although both are beginning to calm. \nThe Bank was briefed early on most of the chancellor\u2019s spending announcements, including the above-inflation public sector pay settlements. So far they seem relaxed, with insiders suggesting that it is private sector wages that set the benchmark for public sector ones, not the other way around.\nThe inflationary dragon is on the retreat, but is not yet totally vanquished. One cut has been delivered, and they will slowly tiptoe their way to some more cuts over the course of the next year. \n\u201cEnjoy your summer, but don\u2019t go wild\u201d appears to be the message to Britain\u2019s consumers.",
    "The site of a kiln that was used in the building of Roman Britain's second-largest town is being excavated.\nArchaeologists and volunteers have spent some of the past three years working to uncover more of the kiln, which they have said was used to build Cirencester, in Gloucestershire, and other places.\nTiles from the site at Brandier, a tiny hamlet near Minety in Wiltshire, have markings found on artefacts over a large area - as far as Old Sarum, near Hereford, the Cotswolds and Reading.\nThe owners of the site hope to open it up to the public.\nBits of tile had been found on the top of the field where the dig is happening.\nNeil Holbrook - CEO of Cotswold Archaeology which is running the dig - explained that 200 years ago an expert found a stamped tile in a Roman villa near Cirencester, saw the letters stamped on it and wondered where it came from.\nNow the site, which he described as what would have been a \"major regional industry\" for creating Roman buildings, is being excavated.\n\"We had hoped we might find something here, but we had no idea we would. It's absolutely exceeded all expectations,\" he added.\n\"This is an amazing discovery.\"\nOnly 10 to 20cm of topsoil had to be taken off for the team to uncover the structure.\nAnton Beechey, also from Cotswold Archaeology and site manager, said: \"Most of what we see here would have been underground, and above would have been the firing chambers.\" \nHe said the kiln would have been in use for about 150 years until stone tiles became more popular.\nThe tiles being found are generally rejects from the time, and other waste material from the kiln which Mr Holbrook said would have been a \"bit like a pizza oven\".\nOne tile was huge, weighing 25.5kg. Some seem to have been rejected because animals or children had left footprints on them.\nPeter Warry - an expert on Roman tiles - has been at the dig.\nHe said: \"They are very well made. A lot of the stuff you see is for hypocausts for things like heated floors and baths.\"\nHe explained there are six different stamps - many starting with \"TPF\" which he believes - in Latin - would stand for \"made in the public tile works.\"\n\"This would be the municipal tile works for Cirencester\" he added.\nEach tile would have been handmade, with the first bit of the process being the basic shape cut out, then smoothed down.\n\"Every one of these tiles has been made by a roman hand smoothing it down,\" added Mr Warry.\nTiles are not the only artefact found there - Mr Warry pointed out something known as a \"spyhole\".\nIt would have been embedded in the roof of the kiln so workers would check on how the tiles were progressing.\nOne noticeable thing in the excavations are lots of roof tiles lined up along the floor, almost like a pipe.\nCEO Mr Holbrook said this is rare, and was probably down to the British weather.\n\"It was incredibly wet. They built lots of drains - I've never seen anything like this. They've had to fabricate these drains out of semi-circular tiles, designed to be on a roof. They've re-used the products.\n\"The last thing you want is water getting into your kiln, it would put the fire out.\"\nThe dig has been popular among local people, with around 25 volunteers a day helping with the excavations, and another group cleaning the finds.\nPenny, who lives close to the site and has been involved in each of the last three years, said: \"There's a footpath I've walked at the top of this field for years and had no idea this was here.\"\nAnother local, Gill, said: \"It's fantastic to think that 1,800 years ago this was a thriving kiln, and presumably a thriving community.\" \nOliver Lavery is part of the family that owns the land.\nThey are applying for National Lottery funding to see if public activity days can be held there in the future.\nHe remembers there always being something odd about the field.\n\"Ever since we moved here there was a mound here. We would find clay in the hedgerows,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on 0800 313 4630.",
    "The Catholic Church has apologised for its treatment of a priest who was sexually abused as a young adult in the 1980s by a fellow member of the clergy.\nFr Paddy McCafferty gave evidence in the trial of former priest James Martin Donaghy, who was jailed in 2012 for 10 years.\nIn a statement, the Bishop of Down and Connor, Alan McGuckian, said the priest was \"not believed and supported by the diocese when he should have been\".\nHe said he apologised \"most sincerely\" to Fr McCafferty.\nHe said of the priest: \"He showed courage and leadership in the face of incredulity, disbelief and animosity on the part of many, including clergy of the diocese.\"\nDonaghy from Lisburn, who is now in his 60s, was jailed for sex crimes against multiple victims.\nA review into the handling into the cases of Donaghy's abuse by the late Bishop Patrick Walsh and the diocese, was carried out last year.\nIn his statement, Bishop McGuckian said the diocese received a report in February.\nHe said: \"At the time of the abuse Fr McCafferty was a vulnerable young adult.\n\"It is clear now that the report of his abuse was eclipsed by the diocese's focus on child sexual abuse. This should not have occurred. What Fr McCafferty reported in extensive written detail, in 2003, was clearly criminal.\n\"In contemporary church law the sexual abuse of a vulnerable adult victim is of no less magnitude than the abuse of a minor. This was not recognised at that time in the case of a dominant adult abuser and a vulnerable young victim.\"\nHe added that he acknowledged \"the toll\" all of this had taken on Fr McCafferty since his initial reporting in 2001.\nExtending the apology to all of Donaghy's victims, the bishop added: \"When James Donaghy was finally convicted there was a lack of demonstrable regret in the apology from the diocese for the wrongs done to his victims.\n\"I want to take this opportunity now to apologise sincerely to all the victims in that case and all cases.\"\nIn a statement, Fr McCafferty welcomed Bishop McGuckian's apology on behalf of the diocese.\nHe said: \"This has been a very long and painful road. Today is an important step towards further healing and recovery.\"\nThe priest said he had suffered for decades with complex post-traumatic stress disorder.\nDonaghy was released from prison in 2017 after serving five years of his sentence.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this report, support is available at the BBC Action Line.",
    "The moment India won a bronze medal in hockey at Paris Olympics, the players burst into wild celebrations.\nBut PR Sreejesh quietly walked to one end of the field and bowed down in front of the goalpost - his home for almost two decades.\nHe will miss that home, but India will miss him even more. The goalkeeper, who played his last international match on Thursday, leaves an illustrious legacy behind him.\nThe \u201cWall of India\u201d, as he is popularly known, played a crucial role in India\u2019s podium finish. His team were up 2-1 and Spain were fighting hard for an equaliser but Sreejesh thwarted their attempts, especially in the dying minutes of the match.\nThe instincts and the tactful dives he is known for were on full display. His impact on the game can be understood from the fact that the Spaniards earned nine penalty corners,  but couldn\u2019t convert any. Sreejesh and his defence team put their bodies on the line to protect their lead until the end. \nThe former Indian captain can also be credited with bringing India into contention for a medal. The knock-out match against Great Britain went into a penalty shootout and once again it was down to the Wall to protect his team - he did exactly that with two masterful saves.\nHe was in tears after India lost the semi-final to Germany as he knew the elusive gold medal was out of his grasp, but he quickly turned his attention to the bronze medal match. On Thursday, he was crying again \u2013 but this time in joy.\nIndians cried with him and social media was flooded with tributes to the man who carried the country's hopes and dreams for nearly two decades.\nIndia is known to be cricket crazy and players from other sports often don\u2019t get the same attention, fame or money. And for a hockey goalkeeper, it\u2019s even harder to be acknowledged.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to love a goalkeeper. He is invisible, and is only in the limelight when he makes a blunder. When I was young, I didn\u2019t know who India\u2019s goalkeeper was then,\u201d he told the Indian Express in 2021.\nSreejesh never chased attention or stardom; he just liked to get on with the job. It was this attitude that kept him going despite a bitter-sweet debut.\nHe had already made waves in the junior circuit with his quick reflexes and ability to judge a ball\u2019s trajectory in nano seconds.\nBut his debut in the senior team in 2006 at the South Asian Games didn\u2019t go that well. He performed well in the tournament but missed a crucial save in the final against India's arch-rival Pakistan. The criticism that followed was a steep learning curve for him.\nThe next few years were tough as he didn\u2019t get a permanent place in the team. Indian hockey also went through a bad phase during this period, with the team failing to even qualify for the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\nBut Sreejesh continued to work hard on his skills and his moment of redemption came in 2011. It was the final of the Champions Trophy and Pakistan was once again the opposing side.\nHe looked much more self-assured and made two crucial penalty saves to win the game for India.\nSreejesh was thrust into the limelight immediately after the match. He travelled with the team to the London Olympics in 2012 but India ended their campaign without a medal.\nDespite the team\u2019s dismal performance, the custodian of the Indian goalpost continued to perform well. His next shining moment came when he was again faced with Pakistan in the 2014 Asian Games final. He saved two penalties to end India\u2019s 16-year gold medal drought at the Games.\nBut if there is one moment that sums up his character, grit and determination, it has to be the bronze medal match against Holland in the Hockey World League in 2015.\nHe was badly injured, his thighs were covered in ice packs, his thumb was close to broken and his shoulder was covered in protective surgical tapes. He could barely walk the night before the match.\nHe joked that he looked  like a mummy as he took his position at the goalpost. But behind all the pain and the humour was a resolve to win a medal for India in a major international tournament after more than three decades. His stunning saves in the penalty shootout helped India win the match against a superior team.\nHis place as a legend in Indian hockey was now cemented. He was soon asked to lead the team at the Rio Olympics. They didn\u2019t win a medal but reached the quarter-final - bettering their performance from London.\nBut he never let success get to his head, remaining humble and approachable and living his life without the trappings of glamour usually associated with sport stars. This endeared him to his teammates and also Indians at large.\nAn injury in 2017 threatened to end his career. Defying all odds, he made a comeback after two surgeries and several months of rehabilitation.\nBut his performance took time to peak and critics said his famed reflexes had slowed down. Younger goalkeepers were also making a claim for his spot. But he stayed away from the noise and continued to work hard.\nHe was once again ready to end ano",
    "Eyewitnesses have described seeing the moment a passenger plane crashed in the Brazilian state of S\u00e3o Paulo killing all 62 people on board. \n\u201cI saw it passing over my house. It was in a tailspin and smoke was coming out of it,\" Edival Monteiro de Souza, 67, told BBC Brasil.\n\"Then it came straight down and fell on top of the hill. It was all very fast. The noise was very loud, it made you shudder. Then black smoke went up and that was it.\u201d\nLet\u00edcia Oliveira do Nascimento, 25, said that the falling aircraft looked like a paper plane.\n\"It was clear that the pilot had lost control and that something bad could happen,\" she told BBC Brasil.\n\"It was very close to the neighbourhood where I live.

    "As cars zip down the M6 near Bedworth, Warwickshire, a large field alongside the motorway lies empty.\nWith parched grass and dry mud as far as the eye can see, the field looks like typical farmland and has been used for growing crops in the past.\nBut the owners of this land are embracing a new type of farming, one that yields renewable energy rather than food.\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019d like to do is diversify and futureproof the farm for our sons,\u201d says Cathie Barrs, whose family has been farming in the area for decades.\nThe local council has approved the family\u2019s planning application for a 50-acre solar farm with battery storage, and a solar-powered vertical farm.\nMrs Barrs says they grow crops on most of the 800-acre Littlebrook Farm. \"But,\" she adds, \"we feel that for the next generation, it\u2019s really difficult to farm in a profitable manner.\n\u201cSo we feel this is the way we\u2019d like to go and it\u2019s a very clean technology.\u201d\nStarting with initial research in 2019, it\u2019s taken five years to get to this stage. And yet, not a single solar panel can be seen on the ground.\nMrs Barrs described the planning process as \u201conerous\u201d.\nThe new Labour government says it wants to do something about that, by reforming the planning system and making it easier to build solar farms.\nOne change it\u2019s already proposed is raising the threshold at which solar farms can be approved by local authorities, rather than being referred up to ministers, which causes delay.\nIt\u2019s a technocratic tweak, but Labour believes such reforms will help the government deliver on its pledge to triple the amount of solar power by 2030.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know at this stage what the Labour Party\u2019s policy is,\u201d Mrs Barrs admits. \u201cBut for us, it would have made our lives a lot simpler if we\u2019d had an easier process to manage.\u201d\nSolar power isn\u2019t universally popular in the farming world though.\nMarion Keeley, a farmer near Balsall Common on the Solihull side of the Warwickshire border, says she has concerns about a proposed solar development in the area and the food security of the nation.\n\"This country we live in is an island,\" she says. \"And food security when you live on an island is just as important as energy security.\"\nShe says in an insecure world, we need to produce most of our food and not rely on imports.\nSolar panels currently cover just 0.1% of all land in the UK, and they can sit alongside sheep grazing and crops. The UK government\u2019s latest assessment of food security shows a \u201cbroadly stable picture\u201d, with the country relying on imports for roughly 40% of its food.\nThe National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) has taken a pragmatic position on solar. It says balance has to be struck between food security and climate ambitions.\nAn NFU spokesperson says solar farms \u201cmust be recognised by local authorities as another way of helping farming business become more sustainable and viable\u201d.\nThey add: \u201cPlanning guidance states that, wherever possible, large scale solar farm development should be located on lower quality agricultural land, avoiding the most productive and versatile soils.\u201d\nThen there are the tenant farmers, whose status gives them less say. Some have been evicted by landlords who want to generate solar power on their land.\nBack on Littlebrook Farm, Mrs Barrs says tenant farmers needn\u2019t lose out.\nShe says they could carry on grazing sheep or growing crops on the ground, as her family intends to do.\n\u201cAnything new is very controversial, isn\u2019t it?\" she states.\n\u201cPeople get very emotional and sometimes miss the facts, but it\u2019s a very clean energy that\u2019s cheap to produce.\u201d\nIn a part of the country where coalmining once dominated the landscape, another politically contentious energy transition is under way.\nAnd in part, it will be defined by the way we use our fields and the sun shining on them.",
    "A mum with ADHD has described what it is like to live in a house where everyone is neurodivergent. \nJo Gaunt, 41, from Bradford, was diagnosed with ADHD in March this year, while her three daughters and her husband Anthony, 42, are all autistic. \nShe said people can occasionally express a lack of understanding of their situation, particularly if her children are struggling to cope with something.\nMrs Gaunt has written a book full of the advice and described to the BBC what life in her family is like. \nBeing a neurodivergent parent has its ups and downs, according to Mrs Gaunt.\nHowever, she said things are calmer than they once were.\n\"Ten years ago, we, as a family, were in chaos,\" she said.\n\"Every day was pitted with meltdowns and crisis from the children and me and Anthony didn't know how to support each other's needs.\"\nTwo of her children are 11 and 13, while her eldest daughter is 21.\nThey are all autistic and need each day to be predictable and similar to the one before. \n\"Having ADHD, as much as I have structure and routines, I can manage very well when they get changed around,\" Mrs Gaunt said.\n\"My husband needs quite a strict structure and routines, so we need to balance his needs with the children's needs.\"\nMrs Gaunt's husband has his own challenges with pathological demand avoidance, meaning he will naturally resist instructions. \nAccording to the National Autistic Society, \"the overwhelming anxiety of realising that a demand cannot be avoided, or that these forms of resistance have been exhausted, may result in meltdown or panic\".\nMrs Gaunt said: \"He finds it more of a challenge to meet the children's needs.\n\"He's naturally not an empathetic person, so he needs me to explain why the children need what they need.\n\"He's a fabulous dad, but he just needs things doing differently to what I do.\"\nChallenges are also met outside of the Gaunt family, particularly on days out.\n\"Other people's level of understanding is one of the hardest things to deal with, when you're getting comments when you're stood in line for the ice cream truck and your child isn't managing very well,\" she said.\nMrs Gaunt cited a recent example of this, when she was standing in line at a Starbucks, when one of her daughters was excited for her favourite dragon fruit flavoured drink. \n\"When we got to the checkout she was told that the drink wasn't available.\n\"She just thought, why wouldn't you tell me?\n\"In her mind there is all this technology and screens that they should have let her know.\"\nMrs Gaunt said her daughter had spent her time thinking about the drink and her mind did not have time to process being unable to have it.\nIt is the \"unpredictability\" of the outside world that the Gaunts have to manage to keep life calm. \n\"Life in a neurodivergent household is never easy,\" Mrs Gaunt added - but said they do what they can to prepare their children for the outside world.\nShe added that she is often the person who carries the load, but always ensures she looks after herself too. \n\"Self care as we call it,\" Mrs Gaunt said.\n\"I make sure I have a brew on each day and walk the dogs.\n\"I have a big support network too.\"\nMrs Gaunt said she wishes she had a book full of her advice when her children were first diagnosed.\n\"We ask for help because our home feels like chaos\", she said.\n\"This book is designed to help you move from that chaos to calm.\"\nHer self-published book, Your Safe Space, will be available on 13 August.\nHeidi Mavir, who wrote The Sunday Times bestseller Your Child Is Not Broken, said Mrs Gaunt's book was \"a chance to take a look at some of the chaos in your neurodivergent house, see it in a new light, and take steps to transform your home into a place where you and your autistic children can thrive\".\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "An academic who claims to have discovered a Roman fort while out on a bike ride says his discovery indicates a more militant history for west Wales than previously thought.\nHe believes the site, which is located underneath a farmer\u2019s field in the north of Pembrokeshire, suggests that Wales was fully integrated into Roman Britain.\nDr Mark Merrony, of Wolfson College, Oxford, said he was \"absolutely thrilled\".\n\"I wasn't expecting to find something like this... it's one thing finding a villa or a road, but to find a military site like this is [on] a very different scale altogether really.\"\nThe site is believed to be two to three hectares in size and Dr Merrony said, in its prime, it would have been occupied by 500 soldiers.\nHe said his discovery suggested Wales was completely integrated into Roman Britain, whereas previously only two forts were known to exist in west Wales.\n\"There are more villas than we think and there are more forts than we think. In west Wales, I wouldn't be surprised if there were at least another two, three or more forts that we just haven't found yet.\n\"West Wales has been neglected, partly because there aren't the resources to cover it. So the more archaeologists start looking, the more you start to find.\"\nIn order to determine whether his suspicions were right, Dr Merrony said he looked for Roman material.\n\"I wanted to find a particular roofing slate type, which tends to be hexagonal, with a long point on,\" he said.\n\"I thought if I find one of those, I'm going to be incredibly lucky. The challenge is the site is so overgrown, it's almost impossible to get near the place.\"\nDr Merrony previously discovered a Roman villa in west Wales in 2002, which inspired him to look for more sites.\nHe believes the fort dates back to between the first and third centuries, when the Celtic Demetae tribe inhabited south-west Wales.\nThis discovery means the tribe \"who were thought to have peacefully coexisted with the Roman invaders, weren't probably as peaceful as we think they were,\" Dr Merrony added.\nHe said he had received some criticism from local people in the area, who believed he was \"giving the game away\" as to the location of the site and encouraging \"treasure hunters\" to visit.\n\"But I haven\u2019t said where it is,\" he added. \"They're assuming it's somewhere that it's not.\n\"They might find some rusty nails for the roofing slates.

    "Campaigners opposed to a large solar energy project have warned it would cause significant damage to communities and the landscape of southern Lincolnshire. \nThe Meridian Solar Farm could become the biggest development of its kind in Europe, generating electricity for more than 200,000 homes, if it gets the go-ahead from the UK government. \nDavid Vernon, of developer Downing Renewable Developments, said it had met hundreds of residents and stakeholders during a consultation and the project would deliver significant benefits at both a national and a local scale.\nHowever, one opponent, Stuart Gibbard, said he feared it would \"desecrate\" a \"unique\" fenland landscape.\nIf approved, the facility \u2013 which the developer has said would meet \"the urgent need for cleaner forms of generation to replace fossil fuels\" \u2013 would cover an area the size of 1,400 football pitches on land to the south of Spalding. \nMr Gibbard, an agricultural historian living near the village of Moulton Chapel, described the area as \"one of the most unspoilt\" areas of fenland left in England and warned that it could be lost forever. \nThe Meridian Action Group has been formed to oppose the plans and now has more than 400 members, according to organisers.\nTheir concerns range from the loss of valuable farmland to the potential impact of industrial activity. \nCampaigners are concerned that Lincolnshire's role in supplying food to the wider country should not be jeopardised. \nCouncillor Colin Davie, the executive member for economic development, environment and planning at Lincolnshire County Council, said: \"I have repeatedly said that these enormous infrastructure projects should not be dumped in our county and ruin the quality of life of our residents. Our agricultural land should be protected.\"\nThe project is at an early stage of planning, but Meridian's developers have said it would \"make a significant contribution to energy security in the UK\" and \"play a key role in accelerating the country's transition to net-zero\".\nHowever, Jane Thompson, of the Meridian Action Group, said the cost to the local community would be too great. \n\"To suddenly have this green and pleasant land swathed in industrial solar panels doesn't bear thinking about,\" she said. \n\"We feel that we are being railroaded and people are not considering our feelings with regard to our community.\"\nSolar farms greater than 50 megawatts in output are considered too significant to the UK's energy needs to be decided by local councils. \nThe government has the final say on these so-called \"nationally significant infrastructure projects\", or NSIPs.\nIn recent weeks two NSIP solar farms in Lincolnshire have been given the go-ahead by ministers \u2013 Mallard Pass, near Stamford, and Gate Burton, near Gainsborough. \nIn allowing them to be built, the new energy security secretary, Ed Miliband, described solar power as \"crucial\" to the UK's need for cleaner, cheaper energy. \nThe Meridian Solar project would be built near a number of small villages and hamlets south of Spalding. \nThe developers have said it would include a battery storage facility and require a 12km (7 mile) pylon network to connect it to a substation and the national electricity network.\nThe company's website states that, \"renewable energy and associated infrastructure are critical to the transition to a low-carbon economy and achieving net-zero carbon emissions targets\".\nMr Vernon, who is the head of NSIP projects at Downing Renewable Developments, said a \"recent non-statutory consultation was an important step in understanding the communities' views to help inform the early stages of design\".\nThe company held five events and said it wanted to develop a project that \"takes account of national and local specific issues in its design and operation\".\n\"The location for Meridian was driven by the search for opportunities to connect to the national grid, and we\u2019ve ensured that the highlighted site areas on the proposals map include land areas that can be used for environmental mitigation and enhancement zones, recreational areas, buffers, and community benefit initiatives, as well as areas for the solar and storage infrastructure,\" he added.\n\"We are also passionate about directly supporting the communities associated with our projects through community benefit schemes.\"\nRecent examples from other projects included providing rooftop solar installations, installing electric vehicle charging points, providing permissive paths for walking and recreational use, and creating STEM and employment opportunities.\nMr Vernon said the company would offer an update on key findings from the consultation in the autumn, before presenting initial design proposals.\nThere are at least 10 other large solar farms proposed for Lincolnshire, in various stages of planning. \nThe government has said it wants to speed up the decision-making process for big energy projects as it strives to improve the UK's energy security.\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (fo",
    "Susan Wojcicki, the former boss of YouTube and one of Google's earliest employees, has died aged 56. \nGoogle's chief executive Sundar Pichai announced that Ms Wojcicki had passed away after two years of living with lung cancer.\nMr Pichai, who is also the boss of Google's parent company Alphabet, said on X/Twitter he was \"unbelievably saddened\" and Ms Wojcicki  was \"as core to the history of Google as anyone\".\nOnce described as the \"most important Googler you've never heard of\", Ms Wojcicki was present at the company's beginnings when, in 1998, she rented out her Menlo Park garage to the search engine firm's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. \nShe was later persuaded to leave her job at chip giant Intel to join Google, becoming the firm's 16th employee. \nMs Wojcicki would go on to lead YouTube, the online video sharing company owned by Google, for nine years until 2023 when she stepped down to focus \"on my family, health and personal projects I'm passionate about\".\nMs Wojcicki was one of relatively few women to hold a senior role in the technology industry.\nShe wanted to encourage more girls to go into the field, telling the BBC's Newshour in 2013 that the future was going to be \"increasingly digitally influenced\".\n\"But then I see there are very few women in the industry,\" she said. \"Overall the tech industry has, on average, probably about 20% women and I also look at the pipeline of girls coming out of technical degrees and it is very small.\" \nWhile Ms Wojcicki rose to become the boss of YouTube, her tenure was not without controversy. The platform faced criticism over its handling of online disinformation, including during the Covid pandemic.  \nIn 2022, a number of fact-checking organisations wrote to her accusing YouTube of being \"one of the major conduits of online disinformation and misinformation worldwide\".\nMs Wojcicki stepped down a year later to focus on her personal life and health. \nAnnouncing her death \"with profound sadness\", her husband Dennis Troper said: \"My beloved wife of 26 years and mother to our five children left us today after two years of living with non-small-cell lung cancer.\"",
    "Campaigners fighting for the clean-up of thousands of tonnes of illegally-dumped waste in a Kent woodland are threatening legal action against the Environment Agency (EA).\nSolicitors Leigh Day have sent a letter to the agency saying it urgently needs to instruct a contractor to carry out the clearance of Hoad\u2019s Wood, near Ashford.\nLocal residents said they wanted work to begin last month after the former Environment Secretary issued a formal ministerial direction to the EA in May to fund and carry out the clean-up, but there is still no date of when work will begin.\nThe EA said it was working with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to appoint a contractor for clearance to take place as soon as possible, adding: \"In the interim, all environmental monitoring is continuing with no negative effect seen.\u201d\n\nIt is estimated there are about 30,000 tonnes of waste to clear from an area that measures around 100m by 60m.\nIn some areas, the waste is up to 4m deep and has been there so long that weeds are beginning to cover it. \nA resident who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals said: \u201cWe felt compelled to pursue legal action because of the EA's delays and lack of a concrete timeline for clearing the illegal waste.\n\u201cThe inaction led to 30,000 tonnes of waste being illegally dumped despite proactive community reporting.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cFollowing the ministerial directive, the EA initially aimed to use a framework contractor, which we believed was the quickest solution.\n\"However, the EA has now opted for an open tender, with an anticipated contract award around 23 September, four months after the directive.\n\"None of the dates are concrete, and without demonstrating our seriousness, we fear the EA will continue to delay the clean-up.\u201d\nA residents' campaign group - Rescue Hoads Wood - raised \u00a31,800 in 72 hours in crowdfunding to cover the costs of the letter. \n\nThe agency said a \"restriction order was extended for another six months in June and no further tipping has taken place onsite.\n\"Our investigations into those responsible for the tipping are continuing. We are confident those responsible will be brought to justice.\"\nIt added: \"The EA will seek to retrieve the costs of clearing the site from the criminals behind the dumping \u2013 maintaining the position that the polluter must pay for environmental damage.\"\nIan Rickards, area manager for Kent Wildlife Trust, said many of the trees in the area of the waste are dying.\nHe said: \u201cSome of these trees have been buried, encased, in several metres thick of waste, so that\u2019s going to stop the water and nutrients getting down to the root system.\n\"And goodness knows what\u2019s in that material as well that\u2019s then being eaten up by the trees and absorbed by the trees into the body.\u201d",

    "A London council has said it will withdraw its pension investments in firms linked to arms producers.\nLabour-run Waltham Forest Council says \u00a3773,000 of its \u00a31.1bn pension fund \"appears to be invested in companies that may derive some element of income from arms\".\nIt says the decision is in line with its \"beliefs\" and it has updated its \"ethical investment policy\".\nLocal campaign group Waltham Forest for a Free Palestine (WF4FP) has been calling for the council to take the action, known as \"divesting\", because of of Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive in Gaza.\nIsrael says it is defending itself, following the deadly attacks last October by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is proscribed by the UK government and others as a terrorist organisation.\nThe decision was taken by the council's pensions committee, whose members act as trustees and have the job of deciding how the fund should be invested in the best interests of the scheme's members.\nThe BBC understands the move is to include cutting financial ties with firms involved in supplying arms not only to Israel, but to any country.\nIts chair, councillor Johar Khan, said the north-east London authority had taken a responsibility to invest the fund ethically, which it took \"extremely seriously\".\n\"We work hard to balance this responsibility with the important task of ensuring the fund performs well and continues to support the people who rely on it,\" Mr Khan said. \nThe local authority told the BBC the decision to divest was subject to a \"robust definition\" of the term \"arms trade\", but this definition may become \"better refined as the sources of information become more comprehensive\".\nIt said while a small portion of its pension fund was held in firms involved with producing arms in some way, the fund had \"zero investment\" in companies that had arms identified as their main source of income. \nMr Khan said: \"This is a complex task that will take some time, and we will keep the community and the pension fund recipients informed as we progress.\"\nWaltham Forest said it would also encourage other councils in the capital to divest in this way, which would be done through the London Collective Investment Vehicle (LCIV), which manages pooled pension funds on councils' behalf.\nThe decision was announced at a special meeting of the council's pensions committee, attended by members of WF4FP.\nThey were invited to present a petition calling for the council to divest from firms the group believed were \"complicit\" in arms dealing.\nA spokesperson for WF4FP said the group was \"extremely pleased\" with the decision and hoped it would set a precedent with other London boroughs.\nAlthough Israel is a major weapons exporter, its military has been heavily reliant on imported aircraft, guided bombs and missiles for its campaign in Gaza.\n\nWaltham Forest's decision follows calls on the UK government to halt weapons exports to Israel.\nThe government says it is \"reviewing the advice\" on exports to Israel and \"no decision has been made\".\nThe campaign group We Believe in Israel is calling for any such plans to be scrapped.\nIts executive director Catherine Perez-Shakdam said: \"Israel has an unequivocal right to self-defence, particularly in the face of threats from terror groups that the UK itself has proscribed.\n\"We fully acknowledge the concerns about civilian safety (in Gaza); however, the responsibility lies with Hamas, which continues to incite violence and endanger innocent lives.\"\n\nMany public bodies and private companies hold pension funds in firms that some consider to be unethical in some way. These include tobacco, gambling and alcohol firms, as well as arms. \nJustin Wray, of the Pension and Lifetime Savings Association, said: \u201cPension schemes have a significant interest in ensuring that the companies they invest in operate to high standards. Funds of all types will typically apply screening along environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles relevant to the types of investment strategy they offer.\"\n\u201cWhere they are not happy with the actions of the company they may take the decision to divest,\u201d he explained.\nHowever, he added that, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, there had been \"renewed debate about the ethics of investing in arms manufacturers\".\nIn April, the former Conservative government issued a joint statement with the Investment Authority, which said: \"Investing in defence companies contributes to our national security, defends the civil liberties we all enjoy, while delivering long-term returns for pensions funds and retail investors.\n\"Investing in good, high-quality, well-run defence companies is compatible with ESG considerations as long-term sustainable investment is about helping all sectors and all companies in the economy succeed.\"\nWaltham Forest's decision has also been welcomed by national campaign group the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), which believes many other local authorities have pension investments in firms linked to the arms t",

I felt really good about that because we relate so much that she used the word 'twin' as a metaphor because we have the same cancer,\" he said.\n\"Using the word twin is really personal. That brightened me up.\"\nMr Koli said the trip \"took me out of the negative zone where I was\".\n\"It set me free and gave me hope that life is not over,\" he said.\n\"I used to be shy around people, but I made new friends and it boosted my confidence.\"\nDame Ellen, the charity's founding patron, said: \"We see it time and time again.

    "Italy, which receives the most migrant arrivals in the European Union, is partially outsourcing the challenge from today, as it opens the first of two planned camps in neighbouring Albania.\nMigrants will only start to arrive at the camps once both are open and operational. \nThe centres will be used to house up to 3000 migrants per month rescued en route to Italy as part of Europe\u2019s first \"offshoring\" scheme, while the continent grapples with how to respond to the challenge of irregular migration.\nThe camp that opens today is located in the northern Albanian port of Shengjin. The opening of a second centre, on a former air force base in nearby Gjader, has been delayed.\nThe structures will be entirely managed by the Italian government, which paid for their construction.\nThey will be used for migrants picked up in international waters \u2013 though not women, children, or those deemed vulnerable.\nOnce there, they will be allowed to request asylum in Italy. If refused, they will be sent back to countries deemed safe to return.\n\u201cItalian and European legislation will be applied in these centres,\" Fabrizio Bucci, Italy\u2019s ambassador in Albania, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a centre in Italy \u2013 but in Albania.\u201d\nThe agreement signed by the Italian and Albanian Prime Ministers will remain in place for five years \u2013 with the option to extend if it proves successful in reducing the migrant burden on Italy and deterring some from attempting to come. \nArrivals in Italy by sea this year \u2013 around 31,000 so far \u2013 are down by more than half from the same period in 2023. \nGiorgia Meloni, the Italian Prime Minister, ran for office promising to clamp down hard on migration \u2013 and the Albania plan has become a key tenet of that.\nThe hefty price tag, estimated at upwards of \u20ac650m (\u00a3547), is one of the criticisms levelled by Italian opposition politicians and human rights groups.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an excessive cost to detain a limited number of migrants\u201d, said Riccardo Magi, an MP with the left-wing +Europa party. \nWhen Ms Meloni recently visited the site in Albania, he approached her car to protest \u2013 and was grabbed by Albanian security officials. As she intervened, telling them to ease off, he shouted: \u201cIf they treat an elected MP like this, imagine how they\u2019ll treat the migrants\u201d.\nSpeaking to the BBC, he compared the structures to a penal colony. \nHe also doubted the ability of night-time rescuers to properly screen those picked up to ensure that no vulnerable individuals are sent to Albania. \n\"They won\u2019t be able to delve deep into whether somebody has suffered torture or sexual violence or discrimination due to their sexuality back in Africa\u201d, Mr Magi said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s all an attempt at dissuasion and a PR show to tell Italians this is the first time a government can keep migrants out. But nobody who has risked their life to cross to Italy will be discouraged.\u201d\nFabrizio Bucci, the Italian ambassador in Tirana, disagrees. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the elements that migrants and smugglers will have to factor in,\" he said. \n\u201cWhat do we have to lose? We\u2019ve been trying to redistribute migrants throughout the EU and it hasn\u2019t worked. So why not try to chart a new way?\u201d He refers to it as an experiment that, if successful, could be replicated.\nIndeed, 15 EU members, led by Denmark, recently wrote an open letter to the European Commission backing the outsourcing of migration. Sir Keir Starmer praised the Italy-Albania deal after meeting both Prime Ministers.\nIt has drawn comparison with the plan of the previous Conservative government to deport failed asylum seekers from the United Kingdom to Rwanda \u2013 ditched by Mr Starmer. \nBut the agreements are significantly different.\nWhile Rwanda would have managed the asylum requests and centres under its deal, giving successful claimants asylum there and deporting failed ones to third countries deemed safe by the Rwandan government, the Albania deal will be under Italian jurisdiction. \n\u201cWe made sure the Albanian legislation was already in full compliance with EU and international laws\u201d, said Ambassador Bucci.\nFor Albania, the reward is a boost to its image as it negotiates European Union membership. \nBut Vladimir Karaj, a Tirana-based journalist with the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, said it was a \u201ccomplete surprise\u201d when it was announced by the Prime Minister Edi Rama. Before the Rwanda deal was struck, there were reports that Britain was aiming for an agreement with Albania, which Mr Rama forcefully shot down. \n\u201cHe claimed he was strictly against this kind of treatment for refugees\u201d, he said. \u201cSo when Albania struck the deal with Italy, there was huge speculation over what Rama was gaining personally.\"\nMr Karaj says there\u2019s no \"smoking gun\": \"The government\u2019s narrative is that Italy is our best friend and took in Albanians when our dictatorship fell in the 1990s.\u201d\nThe deal, Mr Karaj said, has been met only with short-lived protests by some claiming it was aimed at replacing Albanians with foreigners, or giving away territo",

Ms Simpson's murder was originally thought by police to have been a suicide.\nSpeaking at a Policing Board meeting on Wednesday, the chief constable also commented on officers who were filmed in police vehicles taking part in GAA celebrations in Camlough, saying they did not act \"professionally or independently\u201d.\nOn the Katie Simpson case, Mr Boutcher said police systems \"failed to identify\" the previous offending of Jonathan Creswell, who was later charged with Katie Simpson's rape and murder.\nThe trial ended abruptly when the defendant was found dead.\n\"There are a number of shortcomings in our initial investigation,\" Mr Boutcher said.\n\"I cannot apologise enough to the (Simpson) family for the delay in getting the right response.\"\nFor a number of months, the PSNI did not treat her death as suspicious.\nMr Boutcher also defended detective chief inspector John Caldwell, who, it has been claimed, was resistant to investigating her death.\nAllegations were raised in a recent BBC Spotlight programme.\nThe chief constable said: \"The programme was disparaging, in my view, and damaging to his professional reputation and in turn public confidence in the police.\n\"John is not subject to misconduct proceedings.\n\"He did not conduct the role of senior investigating officer at any stage in relation to this case.\n\"In my view, probably, the primary reason for attention on Mr Caldwell is because he is a known public figure for very sad and tragic reasons.\"\nMr Caldwell survived a gun attack claimed by the dissident republican New IRA in February 2023.\nMr Boutcher added: \"It is unfortunate this issue has distracted from the tragic death of Katie and the important lessons that will be learned by the police.\"\nMr Boutcher also spoke about the PSNI officers who took part in GAA celebrations in Camlough. \nIt comes after videos emerged of officers taking part in celebrations following Armagh's All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final victory over Galway on Sunday.\nThe footage appeared to show officers in police vehicles waving flags and sounding their sirens.\nThe chief constable said the officers did not act \"professionally or independently\u201d.\nHe said he did not support their actions and described their driving \u201cat best irresponsible\u201d.\nAn internal investigation is under way.\nMr Boutcher said no-one was being sacked, suspended or relocated.\nMr Boutcher said it was not lost on him that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had posted on its Armagh social media channels \"rightly congratulating Armagh on winning the All-Ireland final\", accompanied by details of the force's Fatal Five road safety messaging, reminding drivers to stay safe.\n\"Later that evening, police vehicles were seen being driven in Camlough in a manner which was irresponsible,\" he said.\n\"I, of course, understand the sentiment of what those police officers were seeking to do in supporting the local community in Armagh\u2019s brilliant win.  \n\"But there are many other ways to show that support, driving in that manner is not one of them.\"\nMr Boutcher added that he had received phone calls both condemning and supporting the officers' actions.\nHe said that an internal investigation had been launched \"which will be proportionate and will not be unduly influenced by anyone\".\n\nSeveral unionist politicians had questioned the actions of the PSNI officers involved and on Monday members of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) met with PSNI officials to raise their concerns.\nThe party's policing spokesperson, Trevor Clarke MLA, said after the meeting: \"We\u2019re very careful to just make our point today in terms of the erratic driving, the manner in which the police officer drove the car around and around the roundabout and enjoyed the triumphalism of the celebration of the football.\n\"We\u2019re actually allowing the police to investigate this in such a manner and come to their own conclusions, giving everyone involved a fair hearing, and let them go through the process.\"\nTUV leader Jim Allister said he would be contacting the police ombudsman, Northern Ireland's police watchdog, and the chief constable following a \"disgraceful display by officers in a marked PSNI car tonight in Camlough\".\n\"They can be seen driving through the village waving GAA flags in a fashion which could best be described as joyriding while using the siren improperly,\" the North Antrim MP continued.\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in infrastructure minister John O'Dowd said that criticism had been \"blown out of all proportion\".\nMr O'Dowd said: \"That PSNI officer [has] done more for community relations with the nationalist and republican community than any glossy brochure or any glossy recruiting campaign would",
    "There are more than 40 countries on the government's red list, which has the strictest travel restrictions.\nOne is India, where a new mutation of coronavirus first identified in the country has spread to the UK. This has been linked to international travel. It has been classified as a \"variant of concern\" and more than 3,400 cases of it have been found in the UK.\nBut despite this and the discovery in the UK of other variants identified abroad, the government has never banned international travel altogether - unlike some countries.\nA traffic light system has been introduced for travel, with countries classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests.\nRed list countries (which include India, Pakistan, Brazil and South Africa) are those the UK government says are at the highest risk from Covid, and should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\".\nIf you have been in one, you can only enter the UK if you are a UK or Irish national, or UK resident.\nYou must be tested negative for Covid-19 before departure and self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel.\nDirect flights from many red list countries to the UK are banned but some are allowed. These include flights from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya. The government says this is to avoid potential disruption to critical freight and British nationals seeking to return home.\nOn one day (19 May), Reality Check counted 4 direct flights from India to Heathrow.\nCoronavirus variants originally found in Brazil, South Africa and India are believed to be more transmissible, and there are concerns vaccines may not be quite as effective against them.\nBritish and Irish citizens who have been in these countries are allowed to return to the UK and - until mid-February - were trusted to self-isolate at home and could take public transport to get there. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had moved \"as fast as we could\" to introduce quarantine hotels, describing them as a \"very tough regime\". The measures began on 15 February 2021, after weeks of speculation.\nLabour said there had been a lack of a \"comprehensive\" border system. \nThe Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. \nThe country was placed on the red list on 23 April and there has been criticism that it should have been added earlier.\nJust under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling, according to a 13 May briefing from Public Health England. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England.\nPositive tests from passengers arriving in the UK are automatically sent for genome sequencing, which identifies new variants.\nBut there is concern that by the time a variant has been identified, it may already have spread in the UK.\nThe debate over whether to shut UK borders stretches back to the start of the pandemic.\nBetween January and March 2020, the UK introduced some measures to try to protect itself from the new virus.\nQuarantine was imposed on 273 people travelling from Wuhan in China, where the first outbreak was seen. Others from \"high-risk countries\" including China, Iran and Northern Italy were asked to voluntarily isolate for 14 days.\nAn inquiry into the pandemic suggested it was understandable the government \"did not consider it practical or effective simply to restrict flights\" at that time, partly because there were so many British residents trying to get home.\nBut these self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on 13 March 2020 - 10 days before the UK went into the first lockdown.\n\"The government's failure to have proper quarantine measures in place in March as the infection was spreading fast was a grave error and meant Covid spread faster and reached more people,\" Yvette Cooper, chair of the committee of MPs behind the inquiry said. \nOne study found the virus was introduced to the UK \"well over a thousand times in early 2020\", with a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from France, neither of which faced any restrictions. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases.\nAt the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against travel bans, saying they were \"usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact\".\nIn April 2021, the WHO said it would update its \"risk-based guidance\" on Covid and international travel.\nThe Home Office said the committee behind the inquiry was \"incorrect in their assertions\".\nIt said keeping borders open helped businesses maintain international connections, boosted the economy and meant people could still travel for essential reasons. \nIt argued that by mid-March 2020 there was \"significant transmission\" in the UK and any extra travel restrictions at that time would",
    "Women are being encouraged to share their experiences of breastfeeding as part of a new arts project.\nArtist Lisa Creagh is urging mothers in Bradford to contribute to the Holding Time project, which will culminate in a permanent photographic exhibition at Bradford Royal Infirmary.\nMs Creagh said she had been inspired to explore the subject following her own difficulties and said she wanted to try and remove the stigma around breastfeeding issues.\n\u201cIt's about helping women unpack their breastfeeding journeys because there's a lot of pain and there's a lot of joy,\" she said.\nDescribing her own situation she said it was \"deeper than any kind of vulnerability I've ever experienced before in my life\" and said she hoped to understand how women \"overcome the many structural and cultural barriers to breastfeeding\".\n\"I think women need to start listening to each other rather than silencing each other,\" she said.\n\"We've lived in that kind of culture and it's quite oppressive, where we're sort of policing each other and policing ourselves, and not talking about our birth stories, not talking about our breastfeeding stories. That's not helping.\n\"We're not learning anything from all of us just being alone and not discussing these things. So it's about honouring those stories.\"\nMs Creagh spoke to the BBC about her project during World Breastfeeding Week, with campaigners highlighting the fact that breastfeeding rates in the UK are among the lowest in the world.\nAccording to Unicef, only 24% of mothers in the UK were exclusively breastfeeding at six weeks, dropping to around 1% at six months.\nIn Bradford, health teams have launched a campaign to support local mums to breastfeed \"here, there and everywhere\".\nVenues from cafes and restaurants to hairdressers and shopping centres are being encouraged to sign up to welcome breastfeeding mums and display breastfeeding friendly signs.\nJane Dickens, the strategic breastfeeding lead for Bradford district, said: \"Although breastfeeding in public is protected by law, if mum is out and about, she can feel uncomfortable and at times unwelcome to breastfeed. \n\"That needs to change if we\u2019re to support mums to continue breastfeeding and so reduce the incidence of common childhood illnesses such as ear, chest and gut infections.\u201d\nActivities for the Holding Time project have already begun in Bradford, with groups of local mothers meeting Ms Creagh, giving interviews and taking part in photo shoots in the city. \nNext month free writing workshops will be held to give women the chance to create a short piece of writing based around their birth and breastfeeding experiences.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "The death of a mother at the hospital where she gave birth to her fifth baby was \"avoidable and contributed to by neglect\", a coroner has ruled.\nLaura-Jane Seaman, 36, died at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, Essex, on 23 December 2022 following a significant peritoneal haemorrhage.\nCoroner Sonia Hayes found multiple \"gross failures\" by healthcare professionals and said if these had not occurred, Ms Seaman would not have died.\nMid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust said it was improving training \"to prevent this from happening again\".\nA spokesperson extended the trust's sympathies to Ms Seaman's family.\nMs Seaman had been known to the Essex trust to be at high risk of postpartum hemorrhage - heavy bleeding post-birth - prior to her admission to hospital.\nA three-week inquest at Essex Coroner's Court heard Ms Seaman, who was a care support worker, had a normal vaginal delivery on 21 December 2022.\nShe was able to breastfeed her baby and there were discussions about her going home before her condition began to deteriorate.\nThere were multiple missed opportunities to recognise this appropriately and to escalate for a senior review, the inquest heard.\nThe coroner was told the mother-of-five repeatedly said to staff that she was dizzy, could feel bleeding and her limbs had gone numb.\nMs Hayes said Ms Seaman had been \"begging staff to help her\" and told them she did not want to die, but staff did not listen.\nMs Seaman had a covert intra-abdominal hemorrhage and was bleeding for hours, but she was incorrectly treated for possible dehydration and given biscuits, the court heard.\nCrucially, notes about her health were annotated on a piece of paper which meant her deterioration was not escalated promptly.\nThe inquest found gross failures were made by multiple clinical staff across a number of disciplines, including the failure to follow the major hemorrhage protocol.\nThe new mother suffered two cardiac arrests and had been bleeding for hours. During emergency surgery, four to five litres of blood were found in her abdomen.\nShe died two days after giving birth following complications from the intra-abdominal hemorrhage.\nMs Hayes ruled there had been a failure of mandatory escalation before Ms Seaman died and said a prevention of future deaths report would be written.\nShe said had action been taken in the form of a review led by a multi-disciplinary consultant, Ms Seaman would not have died.\nMs Seaman's family told the BBC: \"We urge all those involved in Laura-Jane's care to reflect on the failures in her treatment. \n\"Nothing gave her more joy than being a mum. That\u2019s all she ever wanted to be and that\u2019s what she did best.\"\nMaternity services at Broomfield Hospital were rated as \"requires improvement\" in the most recent inspection by the Care Quality Commission.\nThe hospital spokesperson said: \"Our focus has been on improving training in recognising the early signs of deterioration and escalation routes in our maternity services to prevent this from happening again.\"\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Carles Puigdemont, the exiled ex-Catalan leader, has evaded a massive police manhunt and fled Spain, his party has said.\nSpanish authorities launched a large manhunt for Mr Puigdemont on Thursday after he made a shock return to Spain, gave a short speech to crowds in Barcelona and then disappeared. \nThe 61-year-old is wanted by Spain on charges linked to a failed bid for Catalan independence in 2017.\nAfter a tumultuous 24 hours on the run, Mr Puigdemont is now back in Belgium where he lives, his party's secretary general Jordi Turull said on Friday.\nIn 2017, Catalonia's pro-independence leaders including Mr Puigdemont organised a referendum - which was ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court - and later declared independence for the region. \nMadrid imposed direct rule on the region soon after and Mr Puigdemont fled to Belgium.\nFor much of the past several years he has lived in Brussels.\nOn his return after seven years in exile, Mr Puigdemont briefly addressed hundreds of supporters gathered near the Catalan parliament in Barcelona.\n\"Long live a free Catalonia!\" he told supporters and international journalists on Thursday, before saying that he had returned \"to remind you that we are still here\".\n\"Holding a referendum is not and will never be a crime,\" Mr Puigdemont added before quickly disappearing.\nIn an interview with RAC1 radio station on Friday, Mr Turull said he knew the ex-Catalan leader was in Brussels but could not confirm whether he had made it back to his home in the Waterloo municipality.\nThe chief commissioner of Catalan police Mossos d'Esquadra, Eduard Sallent, told journalists on Friday he did not have any information about Mr Puigdemont's whereabouts and the plan had been to arrest him \"in the most suitable place\". \nHe confirmed that two officers were detained on suspicion of helping Mr Puigdemont flee, adding that \"it is possible that other Mossos helped him in his escape\" and the force would follow the appropriate criminal and administrative process for each case.\nOne officer allegedly owns a car in which Mr Puigdemont escaped after making his address, Spanish media reported. The force denied allegations that there had been any collusion with the former leader.\nInstead, it said, he \"took advantage of the numbers of people around him and fled the scene in a vehicle that the Mossos tried to stop but failed\". \nAccording to the party's secretary general, Mr Puigdemont had been in Barcelona since Tuesday before making his surprise appearance outside Barcelona's parliament on Thursday.\nMr Turull said the former separatist leader had dinner in Barcelona on Tuesday night and spent all of Wednesday and Thursday in the region.\nHis appearance coincided with the investiture of Socialist Salvador Illa as the new Catalan president.\nA manhunt was launched, with roadblocks set up temporarily around Barcelona and Spanish TV showing images from La Jonquera, a municipality bordering France, where police could be seen stopping cars and checking the boots.\nCatalonia's police are facing strong scrutiny from a Spanish Supreme Court judge, who has demanded an explanation as to why Mr Puigdemont was able to get away.\nJudge Pablo Llarena, who issued Mr Puigdemont's arrest warrant, has also asked Spain's interior ministry about its plans to arrest him at the border.\nIn documents made public by the Supreme Court, Mr Llarena asked the ministry to explain what orders were issued to detain him \"after his escape\".\nOn Friday, Justice Minister Felix Bolanos said the search for Mr Puigdemont was the Mossos' responsibility as the law enforcement authority in Catalonia. \nBut Mossos director general Pere Ferrer said Thursday's events left the police \"in a situation they do not deserve\" and blaming officers for \"unresolved political problems is bad business\".\n",

I have several team members from Northern Ireland who trained on Thrones.\u201d\nHouse of the Dragon is set 200 years before Game Of Thrones, and follows the fortunes of the Targaryens - a noble family with the power to control dragons.\nWith hundreds of costumes to oversee, where does a designer begin?\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d Caroline said.\n\u201cThe fans of the show, and particularly those who have read the books, have got very firm ideas of how things should be.\n\u201cThe politics and the economics of these places have changed between our show and Game Of Thrones.\n\u201cTo dress people accordingly, basically in a redefined Westeros, was quite something to get my head around.\u201d\nIn season two, the houses have separated, \u201cso there\u2019s a natural reason to redesign quite a lot of the principle characters\u201d, Caroline explained.\nHer research spanned \u201cthousands of years of history\u201d as she drew inspiration from cultures including the Roman and Byzantine Empires and the Mayans.\n\u201cI took all this reference and sort of divvied it up in to what aesthetically worked for each house,\" she said.\n\u201cFor example, the Targaryen look, it\u2019s sort of brutalist in style, in terms of its adornment and embroidery, it\u2019s more abstract, whereas the folks at Kings Landing are more naturalistic.\u201d\nWith a team of up to 300 people, costumes are painstakingly dyed, printed and decorated, often taking months to complete.\nThe first series of House of the Dragon, much like its predecessor, faced some criticism for its dark cinematography, something that showrunner Ryan Condal has acknowledged and adjusted.\n\u201cWe went into season two very conscious of that feedback,\u201d he told The Hollywood Reporter.\nThe cinematography is something Caroline was very aware of as she produced her garments.\n\u201cWe tried before filming to look at colours on camera and in the environments that they would be in, to sort of make sure the greens were reading green or the blues were reading blue,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSome of the sets are really dark, and they should be, Dragonstone and Harrenhal don\u2019t have a lot of natural light coming in.\u201d\nHouse of the Dragon was one of the few US productions that continued to shoot during the Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes.\nFor almost three months in 2023, industry writers and actors walked out in a dispute over fair pay and the use of artificial intelligence in the industry.\nBut the House of the Dragon cast did not take part because the show was mainly filmed in the UK under contracts overseen by British union Equity, rather than its striking US counterpart the Screen Actors Guild.\nThe show's writer Ryan Condal previously told the BBC it was a \"fraught period\", but a \"great privilege\" to keep the cas",
    "Crowds booed as a new Banksy artwork of a stretching cat on an empty, distressed billboard in north-west London was taken down just hours after being revealed.\nThe street artist posted a photo of the design on his Instagram on Saturday without any caption, marking the sixth in a series of animal-themed artworks over the last week. \nThe new Banksy appeared on Edgware Road in Cricklewood, with police taping off the path in front of the artwork as about 50 people gathered to take pictures, before they later saw it removed.\nIt followed the artwork of pelicans appearing to take fish from a chip shop sign, which emerged on Friday in Walthamstow, north-east London.\nHours after Banksy confirmed the design was his in an Instagram post, crowds gathered from across London to see the piece before men, who said they were contractors, arrived.\nThe billboard had been due to be taken down on Monday before the artwork appeared.\nOne contractor, who gave his name as Marc, said the date had been brought forward in case someone \"rips it down and leaves it unsafe\".\nMarc said the artwork will be brought back to their yard to see if anyone collects it.\nHe said: \"We'll store that bit [the artwork] in our yard to see if anyone collects it but if not it'll go in a skip.\n\"I've been told to keep it careful in case he wants it.\"\nA black board was first used to cover the majority of the cat on the billboard at the request of the police, who wanted to stop people walking in the road in front of traffic.\nThe removal effort was briefly paused by police as officers checked the contractors were approved to take the piece down before they were allowed to continue with the work.\nAn officer at the scene said the owner of the billboard had told police he will donate it to an art gallery.\nBen Tansley, 71, a member of the NorthWestTwo Residents Association, said: \"If it wasn't guarded overnight somebody would take it. It's such a shame.\"\nChairwoman of the association, Carol Reeman, 64, added: \"This is Cricklewood, this is our Banksy. You can't even enjoy it for the whole day before someone wanted to take it down.\n\"You would wait for a lifetime for a Banksy to come into our neighbourhood. Cricklewood's on the map.\"\nThe image is one of many seen over the past week.\nA stencilled image of a goat appeared in Kew on Monday while an image of two elephants touching trunks in Chelsea was revealed by the Bristol-based artist on Tuesday, although on Friday it was seen defaced with stripes.\nThree monkeys hanging from a bridge in Brick Lane drew crowds on Wednesday, and a howling wolf on a satellite dish was seen in Peckham on Thursday.\nWhen the artwork of two pelicans appeared above the sign of a fish and chip shop in Walthamstow on Friday, one resident told BBC News: \"It's genuinely really exciting.\n\"A friend messaged me early this morning telling me it's appeared on my street so we arranged to come down as soon as we could.\n\"It's so fun and wholesome - that's what's really nice to see.\"\nShe believed the location, Bonners Fish Bar, was significant.\n\"It's a bit of an icon of the area, so I'm sure that's why it's been chosen,\" she said.\n\"It's been here a long time and it's well loved.\"\nThursday's stencil of a wolf on a satellite dish in Rye Lane, Peckham, was taken down from on top of a building within hours of it being revealed.\nA video was filmed showing two people removing it and carrying it off down the street.\nThe Banksy press team told the BBC they \"believed\" it had been stolen.\nA statement from the Metropolitan Police said it had received reports the dish had been stolen, and said there had been \"no arrests\" and \"inquiries continue\". \nThe Banksy press team declined to comment about the possible meaning behind the series of stencils in London.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A crash involving a man on a privately-owned e-scooter has triggered a debate about their future in a Norfolk town.\nNorfolk Police has appealed for dashcam footage of the moments leading up to the crash at the St Peter's Road and King Street junction in Great Yarmouth on Saturday.\nA man in his 50s was taken to the James Paget University Hospital, Gorleston, with life-threatening injuries after a collision with a grey Ford Focus. He was later said to be in a critical but stable condition.\nThe accident happened six months after licensed operator Ginger removed its e-scooters from the town, blaming the government for repeatedly extending trial periods.\nBoth the Conservative and the Labour groups on Great Yarmouth Borough Council say licensed e-scooters should return, but the owner of the Pleasure Beach says they should be permanently removed from the road.\nThe police have not commented on the legality of the e-scooter being ridden by the injured man, but the force has made clear that only officially licensed hire scooters can be used on public roads.\nCarl Smith, the Conservative leader of Great Yarmouth Borough Council, said he had lobbied the previous government about granting a permanent licence for e-scooter hire operators.\n\"We said we would like to get the trials made so they became permanent. Not only e-scooters but e-bikes, which are a bit more stable,\" he said.\n\"We are still trying to do that, and are working with various people, actively trying to find another operator, as we know lots of people use them.\"\nMr Smith wished the injured man a full and swift recovery, but added: \"He would have been insured [on a legal scooter] but obviously we haven't got any licensed scooters in the town.\n\"All these people flying about the town on these scooters are illegal. They are lethal. Police can confiscate them if they see them. It's as simple as that.\"\nTrevor Wainwright, the leader of the Labour group on the council, also said he hoped the man made a full recovery.\nBut he added: \"I think it's disappointing we haven't got an operator in Great Yarmouth that could run a legal system as Ginger did.\n\"I believe other providers are being talked to, but it is of grave concern that illegal scooters are being used on a public highway, which comes with inherent risks. It's like driving a car with no insurance.\n\"Ginger would still have been in Great Yarmouth had the previous Conservative government not kept pushing the trial back and back.\n\"They just pulled out, asking 'Where are we going with this?' and I don't think they were prepared to put in any more investment without seeing an end date to the trial.\"\nBut the owner of Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach said the trial should not resume, and he urged police to tackle the use of private e-scooters.\n\"I'd be dead against [licensed scooters returning], and I think this [incident] proves a point,\" he said.\n\"We've had so many near misses. You speak to the landau operators \u2013 they were spooking the horses, weaving in and out of the horses.\n\"You've got people who are responsible, but others who are irresponsible and double up on them. I even see people taking the kids to school on them.\n\"I've seen it with my own eyes. It's an accident waiting to happen. If you Google e-scooter fatalities, the list is getting longer \u2013 even if they made them wear crash helmets.\n\"The police need to be more active. I know the police have got enough to do but they know they're illegal.\"\nCouncil chief executive Sheila Oxtoby said: \"We've been back out to tender since Ginger unfortunately pulled out.\n\"We have got some interest, but all of the previous schemes have been pilots, and so [the scooter operators] are waiting to see what the new government's view will be.\n\"We are hopeful they will continue. We think they're a great mode of transport; they're a green way of getting around and we know that [for] young people getting to and from college, they're getting popular.\n\"And we would rather people use licensed scooters than private scooters that are illegal.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "An American woman who was found chained to a tree \"screaming\" in a forest in the western Indian state of Maharashtra had shackled herself, police and her doctor have told the BBC.\nLalita Kayi, 50, was rescued about 10 days ago from the dense forests of Sindhudurg district after her cries for help were heard by shepherds. \nIn a written statement to the police, she had alleged that her husband \"chained her and left her in the forest to die without food or water\".\nMs Kayi, who is receiving treatment in a psychiatric facility, has not spoken publicly. The US embassy has also refused to comment, citing her right to privacy.\nMs Kayi\u2019s discovery had shocked India and police had constituted several teams to investigate how she came to be in the forest. \nSaurabh Agarwal, superintendent of police for Sindhudurg, told BBC Marathi on Tuesday that Ms Kayi had now said that she was not married and that she was probably suffering from hallucinations when she gave her first statement.\nPolice said she told them she had been distressed because her visa had run out and she was running out of money, so she had bought locks and chains and tied herself to the tree. \nDr Sanghamitra Phule, superintendent of the psychiatric hospital where Ms Kayi is being treated, told BBC Marathi that \"her condition is improving\". \n\"She eats, walks and also exercises. She is under treatment and we are also giving her some nutrients that her body was lacking.\"\nDr Phule said her family had been traced in the US and that Ms Kayi was in touch with them on the phone. \nShe was found on 27 July by a cow herder who had taken his cattle to graze in the forest and heard \"a woman screaming loudly\".\n\"The sound was coming from the forest on the side of the mountain. When I went there, I saw that one of her legs was tied to a tree. She was screaming like an animal. I called other villagers and the local police.\"\nThey police sawed off the chain and rescued her. Ms Kayi, who appeared completely emaciated, was taken to hospital and after her physical health improved, she was moved to the psychiatric facility for further treatment.\nPolice said that on her, they found a copy of her passport - which stated that she was a US citizen who came from Massachusetts - and some other documents with her home address in Tamil Nadu. She also had a mobile phone, a tablet and 31,000 rupees ($370; \u00a3290) in her possession.\nMs Kayi, who was initially unable to speak, communicated with the police and doctors by scribbling notes on a pad. \nShe said she was married to a man in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and blamed him for tying her to the tree. She claimed that she had gone without food and water for 40 days. Police had questioned her claim, saying it was unlikely that someone would survive without food or water for so long.",
    "The number of international students studying at Scotland\u2019s universities rose to a record high in the 2022-2023 academic year.\nOverseas students made up nearly 29% of the total, with their tuition fees providing an important source of funding for universities. \nThe biggest proportion by far continued to come from China \u2013 nearly 20,000 students \u2013 but thousands more came from India, Nigeria and the United States.\nThe number of Scottish students, who benefit from free undergraduate tuition, was down by about 10,000 but they still made up nearly 60% of the total. \nOf the 292,240 higher education students, 173,745 were from Scotland while 83,975 were from outside the UK, according to the figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency. \nThe proportion of Scottish to international students varied considerably between universities. \nTwo of Scotland\u2019s top universities, Edinburgh and St Andrews, both had more international students than Scottish students.\nUniversities Scotland believes there has been a drop-off in students arriving from abroad since 2023,  that could put the sector's finances under serious pressure in future. \nIt says free tuition for Scottish undergraduates is made possible by the financial contribution of overseas students.\nA spokesperson said the figures were a snapshot of the situation two years ago, before international upheavals and proposed changes to UK immigration policy affected applications.\n\"That means this data does not provide a sense of what universities are experiencing now,\" they said. \nJohn Chinda and Demi Eleno are both Nigerian students studying for PhD qualifications at Dundee University. \nDemi, 32, whose doctorate is in renewable energy policy, says there is a vibrant community of international students and being part of Scottish culture is a \"wonderful\" experience. \nShe says Scottish universities actively recruit in Nigeria, and while her government will sponsor people for scholarships, it remains an expensive undertaking. \n\u201cWe pay at least four times the amount that other students pay. Aside from the average of \u00a315,000 to \u00a323,000 that students pay each year, you're also going to have to pay for rent, buy groceries, go out to eat,\" she says. \n\"We are stimulating the economy, so it's a bit sad to hear the anti-immigration rhetoric that we\u2019re coming here to drain your resources, when it\u2019s the exact opposite.\u201d\nJohn, 51, who is studying at the university's centre for energy law, says rising prices are a worry which affects his attitude to his studies. \nHe says: \u201cWhen you leave your country, you don't come here to play games. \n\"You come here because, you know, you don't have a chance to fail. Because if you fail, you have fees to pay.\"\nSome academics say the over-reliance on income from international students is not sustainable \u2013 and both UK and Scottish governments need to reconsider this model of funding higher education.\nScotland is the only UK nation to offer free university tuition to its home students.\nStudents who study at universities in England and Wales have to pay up to \u00a39,250 in undergraduate tuition fees, usually financed by student loans. \nThe Student Awards Agency Scotland pays \u00a31,820 per year tuition fees on behalf of most Scottish undergraduate students working towards their first degree.\nProf Sarah Armstrong, an academic at the University of Glasgow, said: \"That's just a drop in the bucket to actually what the education costs.\n\u201cIt raises the question of whether it is right that the government doesn't fund Scottish student places to the extent that it's necessary to actually cover the cost of their education.\"\nThe number of funded university places for Scottish students was raised during the Covid pandemic, but plans to reduce them by 1,200 were detailed in last December's budget. \nOversea undergraduates typically pay more than 10 times as much for tuition, though the majority are studying for postgraduate qualifications where the disparity is smaller.\nProf Armstrong believes cuts in funding have forced universities to become increasingly reliant on overseas students, but she says it is an \"inherently unpredictable\" source of income. \n\"It makes planning extremely difficult,\" she said.\n\"The global situation right now is very troubling for a lot of different reasons, but that also has impacts on choices people make about their education.\n\u201cWhen universities expect high numbers and they don\u2019t meet those numbers, they're going to hit some serious financial risk.\u201d\nProf Armstrong believes there are also ethical questions around the reliance on international students to pay for Scottish students to go to university.\n\u201cIt's not just a source of income. It's human beings who are making choices to come here,\" she said. \nThe Scottish government welcomed the number of international students choosing to study in Scotland. \nHigher and Further Education Minister Graeme Dey said: \"International students play an incredibly positive economic, social and cultural role in Scotland.

    "Some people who were widowed when they retired could be missing out on some of their state pension, a former minister has claimed.\nVarious reviews by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have been taking place since 2021 to correct underpayment of the state pension, primarily to women including widows and divorcees.\nNow Sir Steve Webb, a partner at pensions consultancy LCP and former pensions minister, has said a new group receiving the new state pension and widowed when they reached pension age could also have shortfalls.\nThe DWP said it wanted to ensure everyone received their correct entitlement.\nSir Steve has investigated the cases of four people who were not awarded any inherited state pension when they retired.\nHowever, errors were found in all of the cases and larger amounts and arrears had now been paid, he said.\nIn general, the new group prompting concern appears to include those who are widows or widowers at the point when they claim their new state pension and where either the spouse who has died reached pension age before 6 April 2016 or where they died before 6 April 2016.\nThe exact amount of inherited state pension depends on individual circumstances, including previous employment status and other pensions.\nIt comes during ongoing exercises to correct state pension underpayments which have so far seen more than \u00a3280m paid in arrears to around 23,000 widows or widowers who had wrongly missed out on inherited state pension from a late husband, wife or civil partner.\nSir Steve said: \"Having had to spend years checking hundreds of thousands of historic state pension calculations for errors, you would hope that DWP would be making sure that new claims are handled correctly.\n\"In some cases DWP seems to have failed to automatically add any inherited state pension they were due from a late partner.\u201d\nHe said thousands of people could potentially be affected.\nA DWP spokesperson said: \"We want to ensure pensioners receive all the support to which they are entitled and have a tool to help them understand what state pension they can inherit.\n\"Delays can occur to a customer's state pension award when not all the information we need is provided.\n\"Once we have the necessary documentation, we will then revise the customer's claim as soon as possible.\"",

    "New electricity transmission circuits built under London have been switched on as part of a \u00a31bn project to rewire south London via underground tunnels.\nOne and a half miles (2.5km) of high voltage network went live between Hurst substation in Bexley and Crayford, securing the supply of electricity to thousands of homes.\nThe previous cables were reaching the end of more than 50 years of operation, having been commissioned in 1967, National Grid said.\nThe new energy infrastructure is part of a project to build more than 18 miles (29km) of tunnels under London to \"upgrade and futureproof\" the capital\u2019s electricity supplies.\nAlice Delahunty, president of National Grid Electricity Transmission, said: \"There\u2019s still a way to go on the project, but the Hurst-Crayford circuit seeing volts for the first time is a tremendous achievement for our National Grid teams and supply chain partners.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate what an engineering challenge it has been to build over 20 miles of tunnels under London to upgrade and futureproof the capital\u2019s electricity supplies, so the project\u2019s progress to date is a real testament to all those involved.\u201d\nEnergy minister Michael Shanks welcomed the new energy infrastructure during a visit to New Cross substation.\nHe said: \u201cThe London Power Tunnels show British infrastructure at its best and I congratulate the efforts of everyone involved, as this new circuit switches on to power up homes and businesses across the capital.\u201d\nWork is ongoing on two more major projects: a 7.4-mile (12km) tunnel between Wimbledon substation and New Cross and an 11-mile (18km) tunnel linking New Cross and Hurst.\nThey form part of National Grid\u2019s \u00a31bn London Power Tunnels 2 (LPT2) project.\nAlso under construction is a new substation at Bengeworth Road in Denmark Hill.\nMost of the electricity supply in south London is currently transmitted through underground cables just below the road surface.

    "A renowned British crocodile expert has been jailed for 10 years and five months in Australia, after admitting to sexually abusing dozens of dogs, in a case which horrified the nation.\nWarning: This story contains details readers might find distressing\nAdam Britton, a leading zoologist who has worked on BBC and National Geographic productions, pleaded guilty to 56 charges relating to bestiality and animal cruelty.\nHe also admitted to four counts of accessing child abuse material.\nThe Northern Territory (NT) Supreme Court heard the 53-year-old filmed himself torturing the animals until almost all died, and then shared the videos online under pseudonyms.\nHis abuse went unnoticed for years, until a clue was found in one of his videos. Britton was arrested in April 2022 after a search of his rural Darwin property, which also uncovered child abuse material on his laptop.\nMuch of the detail of Britton's crimes are too graphic to publish, and so \"grotesque\" Chief Justice Michael Grant warned the courtroom they could cause \"nervous shock\".\nAs the facts of the case were read aloud, some members of the public rushed outside. Others watching from the gallery cried and mouthed insults at Britton. He at times hung his head and reached for tissues.\nCalling the offending \"devious\", Justice Grant said the \"unalloyed pleasure\" Britton took in torturing the animals was \"sickeningly evident\".\n\"[Your] depravity falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception,\" he said.\nIncluding time already served, Britton could be eligible for parole in September 2028. He is also banned from owning any mammals for the rest of his life.\nMr Britton's lawyer argued his offending was driven by a rare disorder causing intense, atypical sexual interests.\nIn court on Thursday, they read out a letter from Britton, who apologised for his \"demeaning crimes\".\n\u201cI deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community,\" it said.\nAdding that his family was not aware or involved in any way, he wrote: \"I will seek long term treatment and... I will find a path towards redemption.\"\nBorn in West Yorkshire, Britton grew up in the UK before moving to Australia more than 20 years ago to work with crocodiles.\nWith a PhD in zoology, he had built a global reputation for his expertise, even hosting Sir David Attenborough while the veteran broadcaster filmed part of the Life in Cold Blood docuseries on his property.\nLocals have told media he seemed like a quiet but passionate defender of animals.\nBut he was harbouring a \"sadistic sexual interest\" in them, court documents say. Exchanges with \"like-minded\" people in secret online chatrooms detail how Britton began molesting horses at the age of 13.\n\"I was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to. :),\" he wrote in one message tendered to the court.\nFor at least the past decade, Britton had exploited his own pets and manipulated other dog owners into giving him theirs.\n\"My own dogs are family and I have limits,\" he explained in a Telegram chat entered into evidence.\n\"I only badly mistreat other dogs... I have no emotional bond to them, they are toys pure and simple. And [there are] plenty more where they came from.\"\nHe tortured at least 42 dogs, killing 39 of them, according to court documents seen by the BBC. The files only detail his crimes over the 18 months before his arrest, but still fill more than 90 pages.\nUsing online marketplace Gumtree Australia, Britton would find people who were often reluctantly giving their pets away due to travel or work commitments. He would build a \"rapport\" with them to negotiate taking custody of the animals and if they reached out for updates on their old pets, the court heard he would tell them \"false narratives\" and send them old photos.\nIn reality, he was abusing the animals in a shipping container on his property that had been fitted out with recording equipment - which he called his \"torture room\" - before sharing footage of his crimes online using aliases.\nBritton would also coach others on how to copy his behaviour and get rid of the evidence.\nAsked how to dispose of the dogs' remains, Britton - who shared his sprawling property on the outskirts of Darwin with eight crocodiles - said \"some I feed to other animals\".\nHe was only caught after uploading a clip in which he tortured at least eight dogs - all except one were puppies - which was passed on to NT police in an anonymous tip-off.\nBritton usually went to great lengths to avoid identifying himself or his location in his videos, but in this one a bright orange City of Darwin dog leash could be seen in the background.\nWithin weeks, in April 2022, police swooped on his property and arrested Britton, who has been remanded in custody ever since.\nThey seized recording devices, animal remains and a laptop on which they also located 15 files containing ch",
    "A social media figure who was given hundreds of thousands of pounds by a council during the pandemic said he feels like a \u201csitting duck\u201d due to concerns on the spending.\nSimon Harris, 40, was paid \u00a3367,000 over four years by Essex County Council to run social media accounts designed to promote public health messaging and other causes during and after the Covid pandemic.\nHe was also given an additional \u00a3163,000 to pass on to others, including payments for those working at vaccination centres, despite not being a council employee.\nIn his first full interview since the amounts were revealed earlier this year, he said: \u201cThinking about it now, it\u2019s absolutely horrific, probably the biggest mistake I\u2019ve ever made in my life. All it\u2019s done is make me a massive sitting duck because in terms of public records, the buck stops with me.\u201d\nMr Harris, who describes himself as a social media content creator, told the BBC he was first approached in 2018 by Kirsty O\u2019Callaghan, the then head of strengthening communities, over doing work for the authority to improve its engagement online.\nHe said this work increased over the pandemic and recalled a phone conversation when he was asked to distribute more than \u00a3100,000 to other social media influencers and causes.\n\u201cI think about it now and it is absolutely ridiculous, and it is something I would never ever do again. \n\"I can think back to a phone conversation and it was more just like the conversation you\u2019d have with a council official if they were asking you to look after a cat for a couple of weeks or a packet of biscuits.\"\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m just some bloke who makes memes and people read them, sometimes they don\u2019t read them, and because it was over Covid I\u2019m just assuming that all this must be normal and they just need to get stuff done.\u201d\nThe payments and Mr Harris\u2019 name came to light in January this year prompting him to delete his social media accounts, which he admits, \u201cwasn\u2019t the best way\u201d of dealing with it. \nHowever, he said he was trying to protect his family while also struggling with his own fears over what might happen.\n\u201cI\u2019m waking up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. Every time someone is sending me a screenshot of somebody mentioning something I\u2019m getting heart palpitations. \n\"I\u2019m thinking come offline, keep a low profile, and see what happens, when in fact that wasn\u2019t the best way of handling it.\"\nMr Harris said having his \"wife and four kids at home\" has helped him cope with the situation. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to try and deal with this as best I can,\u201d he added.\nMr Harris also revealed he faced questions in late 2021 from Essex County Council\u2019s counter fraud team, which he described as an \u201cabsolutely horrendous\u201d experience but that he had not heard anything from them since.\nMr Harris was involved in setting up and running Facebook pages such as Essex Coronavirus Action, which has since been renamed Essex is United.\nA recent report from the council\u2019s own audit, governance and standards committee found that some of the Facebook pages being run by Mr Harris and his colleagues had fewer then 200 followers despite thousands of pounds being spent.\nMr Harris told the BBC that in his view the project was \u201cvalue for money\u201d. \nHe said: \u201cI strongly disagree with people who say I just took a load of money and didn\u2019t do anything with it.\n\u201cThe mechanism of how it all came about is horrific and needs properly sorting out which I\u2019m assuming it is.\u201d\nKirsty O\u2019Callaghan, who no longer works for Essex County Council, has not responded to a request for comment. \nA spokesperson for Essex County Council said that during the pandemic \u201cextraordinary decisions had to be taken very quickly\u201d with the need to \u201creach millions of residents in new and different ways\u201d.\n\u201cAs stated in February, some money was paid to an individual to pass onto others. Although it was not illegal, it would not have been allowed to happen in this way if our central services had been aware,\" the spokesperson added.\n\u201cSimon Harris was always an independent contractor who was contracted to provide services to the council.

    "A vulnerable man kept as a slave for almost 26 years has won a \u201crecord payout\u201d after his family sued the government for denying him adequate compensation.\nThe man, known only as Victim A, waited so long for compensation that his captors, who beat him, fed him on scraps and forced him to lay driveways for little or no pay, have been released from prison.\nHis sister said the \u00a3352,000 compensation payment would fund round-the-clock care for her \u201clovely brother\u201d.\nHowever, lawyers said the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d after other victims died before they could take similar action. CICA said over \u00a3165m was awarded to victims of crime in 2023/24.\nVictim A, who was in his fifties, was kept in squalor by the Rooney family on a travellers\u2019 site in Lincolnshire, while they lived a life of luxury.\nThe family violently exploited their victims who were often homeless people or men with learning disabilities, a 2017 trial at Nottingham Crown Court heard.\nWhen 11 members of the family were convicted it was the biggest modern slavery case in British legal history.\nThe Rooneys had amassed a \u00a34m fortune from their driveway business, according to a Proceeds of Crime hearing in 2019 at which they were ordered to pay back \u00a31m, most of it to their victims.\nHowever, Victim A\u2019s sister, who at one stage during his captivity had presumed her brother was dead, said he never received \u201cadequate compensation\u201d, being awarded just \u00a312,428 by the court.\nSeven years since the trial, she has taken action to secure a payout from CICA, which is an agency of the Ministry of Justice.\nRemaining anonymous to protect her brother\u2019s identity, she said she was \u201cincandescent with rage\u201d that he had been forced to wait so long.\nHis wait meant he had been unable to fund rehabilitation for injuries inflicted by his captors.\nShe said she \u201conly wishes the money could fix him, but it won\u2019t\u201d.\n\u201cWhat we got back was not the man that left us,\u201d she added.\nLike many victims of slavery, Victim A could not get Legal Aid to help him secure compensation.\nSolicitor Liam Symonds, of the law firm Freshfields, who represented him on a pro bono basis, said he hoped the case \u201cmight be\u2026 a platform for other survivors to bring their own claims\u201d.\nSolicitor Jamila Duncan-Bosu, from the Anti-trafficking and Exploitation Unit - a charity which works exclusively with victims of modern day slavery and trafficking - believes this is a record payout by CICA to a victim.\nShe said: \"He\u2019s been treated appallingly and that sum of money reflects the level of injury that he suffered.\nHowever, she said it was \u201cabsolutely unfair\u201d that others had died before receiving compensation.\n\"There are many victims of trafficking who suffered equally serious treatment, who should equally be able to get awards of compensation.\n\u201cI\u2019ve personally had four clients die whilst waiting for compensation from CICA.\u201d \nNine out of 10 victims of slavery are initially refused compensation, according to the charity\u2019s research. It said CICA was \u201cbroken\u201d and demanded it be reformed.\n\u201cCICA is not fit for purpose when it comes to victims of modern day slavery, despite it being incredibly common,\u201d said Ms Duncan-Bosu.\n\u201cCompensation is paramount for victims of trafficking, for rehabilitation and to help them rebuild their lives, to stop that cycle of exploitation.\n\u201cIt could be somebody who is working as a nanny or a housekeeper, it\u2019s the people who are working in nail bars, in car washes, individuals who are working in forced labour on building sites.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThis was an awful crime and our thoughts remain with the affected individual and his family.\n\u201cCICA provides compensation to people who were injured as a result of a violent crime and has paid out over \u00a3165m to victims in 2023/24.\n\"We recognise that payment can never fully compensate for the injuries suffered but it can often help brave survivors move on with their lives.\u201d\nThe compensation scheme does not make bespoke provision for victims of human trafficking and modern slavery.\nMs Duncan-Bosu said another problem faced by former slaves was that Legal Aid was not ordinarily available to help them apply for compensation.\n\u201cThe Rooneys had access to advice and assistance [during their trial, as did the victim], she said. \u201cThe victim should also have had access to legal advice and assistance for his compensation matters.\u201d\nThe BBC has contacted the Legal Aid Authority for comment.\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

The BBC Board writes that had he been \"upfront\" about the nature of his arrest, \"we would never have continued to pay him public money\".\nHere is the statement from the BBC Board in full:\nThere is nothing more important than the public\u2019s trust in the BBC; the BBC Board is the custodian of that trust.\nThe Board has met a number of times over the last week to review information provided by the Executive [Committee] relating to Huw Edwards. The Board\u2019s focus has been principally around two issues. Firstly, what was known in the lead up to Mr Edwards being charged and pleading guilty last Wednesday to making indecent images of children; and, secondly, the specifics of the BBC\u2019s handling of the complaints and the BBC\u2019s own investigations into Mr Edwards, prior to his resignation on 22 April 2024.\nThe Board has reviewed the details provided with regard to both series of events. On these, the Board supports the decisions taken by the Director-General and his team during this period. \nThese decisions were based on taking into account a range of factors including: the BBC\u2019s legal and contractual obligations; the knowledge the BBC had at the time; duty of care concerns; and, due regard for the accountability that the BBC has for public money. \nThe Executive has agreed to look at lessons from this period, including the BBC\u2019s approach to the rules surrounding payments when employees are suspended.\nToday, the Board has authorised the Executive to seek the return of salary paid to Mr Edwards from the time he was arrested in November last year. \nMr Edwards pleaded guilty to an appalling crime. Had he been up front when asked by the BBC about his arrest, we would never have continued to pay him public money. He has clearly undermined trust in the BBC and brought us into disrepute.\nWhilst the nature of the charges against Mr Edwards is related to his own personal life, the Board believes these events have also put a spotlight on the question of power imbalances in the workplace. We remain concerned about the potential for inappropriate workplace behaviour, particularly in creative and editorial environments. \nWhilst challenges related to power imbalances in the workplace are a challenge for multiple employers, the BBC must hold itself to the highest standards.\nThe BBC has clearly articulated Values and a strong Code of Conduct and there has been much progress in recent years. \nThat said, the Board will commission an independent review that will make recommendations on practical steps that could strengthen a workplace culture in line with BBC Values. \nThe review will include work already being undertaken within the BBC, as well as working with the rest of the industry as appropriate. We will set out terms of reference and leadership of this review in early September.\nThe review will report to the Board within months, and will be published.",
    "New insights into the secrets of hovering kestrels could help delivery drones navigate the gusty air in cities, scientists at the University of Bristol and RMIT University in Australia suggest.\nThe sight of a kestrel hanging motionless above the ground as it scans for prey is a delight for nature lovers, and a trick drone experts are keen to investigate.\nUsing motion capture technology of the sort used to record performances in blockbuster movies, researchers were able to better understand how kestrels stay so still.\nIts hoped the research could eventually help engineers develop aircraft and fixed-wing drones better able to deal with turbulence and high winds.\nCamera and motion capture technology enabled researchers to observe two Nankeen Kestrels, called Kevy and Jedda, as they hovered in a wind tunnel operated by RMIT.\nNankeen Kestrels are a small species of falcon native to Australia. Both birds came from a local hawk sanctuary and were used in falconry.\nWhile being fed, the birds were fitted  with little reflective stickers in much the same way human actors are when their movements are captured for visual effects in films, a process researchers say didn't bother the kestrels.\nPrevious studies have examined birds flapping - less useful for gaining insights into how aircraft fly.\nBy contrast, it is thought lessons learned from studying kestrel's wind-hovering flight could be particularly valuable for aviation engineers.\n\u201cPrevious studies involved birds casually flying through turbulence and gusts within wind tunnels. In our study we tracked a unique wind hovering flight behaviour\", said RMIT lead researcher Dr Abdulghani Mohamed.\nHis team found the kestrels were excellent at keeping their heads still - moving less than 5mm - while hunting despite the buffeting air. \nThe key to a kestrel's skill in staying still and coping with turbulence is their ability to change the shape of their wings, the researchers think.\nAt present, as anyone who has glanced out a jet window will know, aircraft with wings mostly use hinged control surfaces to control flight.\nNow it's thought the kestrels' \"wing-morphing\" could inspire similar tech in planes and drones.\n\"It may be a more efficient way of achieving stable flight in fixed wing aircraft too,\" said Dr Mohamed.\nStrong winds and turbulence can limit the operation of drones. Those operating in windy environments, such as postal deliveries like those to Orkney, are limited by weather. \nEven small scale drones operating in cities have to navigate the wind-tunnel like blasts around buildings familiar to big-city dwellers. \nAnd increasingly drones are carrying vital supplies such as medicines or carrying out important search or inspection work.\nWing morphing presently would work best at the scale of drones. But associate professor of bio-inspired aerodynamics at Bristol University, Dr Shane Windsor, told the BBC it was possible there could be elements that transfer to planes:\n\"We're seeing more and more large aircraft have more and more flexible wings, so controlling that flexibility which the birds are very, very good at doing, could potentially scale up for commercial aircraft, as well.\"\nKestrels' abilities to sense and adapt to turbulence could also have lessons for large aircraft design.\nPrevious work Dr Windsor has supervised involved fitting backpacks to gulls to explore how they use air currents around buildings to maximise the efficiency of their urban foraging. \nOther researchers have built drones based on studying the abilities of kestrels and other birds to exploit updrafts to save energy when flying.\nAnd Dr Windsor believes there is plenty of further inspiration for engineers to find by considering our feathered friends:\n\"What excites me in general about looking at bird flight is that it just gives us different way of thinking about aircraft, and how to deal with natural environments.\" ",

    "A bench which holds special memories for a family has been restored by an expert on the BBC TV show, The Repair Shop.\nIt belongs to Andy Cox and Madeleine Willis from Northampton and was made out of their first bed.\nThe bench was looking weather-worn and had become seriously unstable.\nIt was restored by the programme's furniture expert, Will Kirk.\nThe bed was the first thing Mr Cox and Ms Willis bought for their home 30 years ago.\nAfter their son Ade's premature birth, the bed played a major role in his homecoming.\nMs Willis said: \"He spent eight months in hospital so, when we brought him home, it was an enormous celebration and we spent days in the bed because that's where we all wanted to be, altogether and all safe.\n\"A couple of years later, I had my daughter, Freya, and she was actually born at home in the bed.\"\nAs the children grew up, the humble piece of furniture became the focus of playtime adventures and it transformed into a truck or a flying bed or whatever the family wanted it to be.\nBut all those adventures took their toll, the bed was replaced and the original was initially used for growing vegetables.\nAde said: \"We disassembled it, took it down the stairs, reassembled the bed, and we put cardboard on the sides and the bottom and then we filled it with veggies.\"\nThe bed then became a bench, which Freya loved to sit on while painting or drawing.\nWhen she went off to university, the bench started to deteriorate.\nMs Willis said: \"Freya was coming home [from university], and I tried to paint it and the leg fell off.\n\"I thought, 'We can't lose it,' it was part of the family.\"\nAt that point, the family got in touch with The Repair Shop.\nThe production team liked the story and Mr Kirk got the job of restoring the bench.\nHe found the legs needed extensive strengthening work, so the wood went on the lathe and a whole new set of feet was carved.\nMr Kirk then sorted out the mortise and tenon joints so the bench would stay together for generations to come.\nMs Willis said: \"It's a piece of furniture but she was part of the family and it was so emotional to see her the way she should be back and repaired.\"\nThe programme will be shown on BBC1 at 20:00 BST on 14 August and will be available on BBC iPlayer.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Donald Trump continues to insist that he once took a scary helicopter trip with former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown, even as Mr Brown dismissed the story as \"fiction\".\nBut it turns out another California politician, Nate Holden, did accompany Trump  decades ago on a turbulent chopper ride, US media report.\nBoth Mr Brown and Mr Holden are black. \nThe former president said during a news conference  that he and Mr Brown had gone \"down\" in a helicopter together and Mr Brown had been \"a little concerned\".\nThe story  became an issue after Trump recounted it on Thursday, in response to a question about Mr Brown's relationship with Kamala Harris. The pair dated in the 1990s.\nTrump was asked whether he thought the relationship had played a role in Ms Harris's career journey. At the time, Ms Harris was a prosecutor and in 2002 was elected district attorney in San Francisco.\n\"Well, I know Willie Brown very well,\" Trump said, before speaking about his memories of the flight.\n\"We thought maybe this was the end,\" Trump said. \"We were in a helicopter... and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing.\"\nHe then claimed the former mayor had told him \"terrible things\" about Ms Harris. \n\"He had a big part in what happened with Kamala,\" Trump said. \nMr Brown, 90, told US media he had never shared a helicopter with Trump, adding: \"I don't think I'd want to ride on the same helicopter with him.\" \nHe also denied he said anything disparaging about Ms Harris.\n\"That's so far-fetched, it's unbelievable,\" he told local TV station KRON. \"I could not envision thinking of Kamala Harris in any negative way. \n\"She's a good friend a long time ago, absolutely beautiful woman, smart as all hell, very successful, electorally speaking.\n\"He was doing what Donald does best, his creative fiction.\" \nDespite a flat denial from the former San Francisco mayor, Trump insisted the story was true in a call to the New York Times, saying he was \u201cprobably going to sue\u201d without elaborating.\nCampaign spokesman Steven Cheung posted a photo of a page of Trump's book \"Letters to Trump\" showing the former president pictured with Mr Brown and including a caption mentioning the helicopter incident.\nMeanwhile Mr Holden, 95, a former Los Angeles city councilman and state senator, told US media outlets he had a distinct recollection of a helicopter trip with Trump.\nIn the 1990s, Trump was attempting to develop property in Los Angeles.\nMr Holden said that they took a very turbulent helicopter ride around 1990, during a visit with Trump to his Atlantic City casino. \nThe helicopter experienced mechanical trouble and was forced to make an emergency landing in New Jersey.\nOthers speculated that Trump, 78, may have confused Willie Brown with Jerry Brown, California's former governor, with whom he shared a helicopter in 2018 to visit the aftermath of the Paradise wildfires. Gavin Newsom, the current state governor, was also on the flight.\nBut both men told US media there had been no emergency landing or danger on that flight.\nTrump's remarks at an hour-long news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate come as recent polls show him slipping against Ms Harris. \nA survey conducted by the New York Times and Siena College from 5 to 9 August puts Ms Harris ahead of Trump by 50% to 46% in three key battleground states - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.\nThe RealClearPolitics polling average gives Ms Harris a slight edge in the popular vote, although Mr Trump retains a lead in a number of the most important swing states.",

    "A man was found guilty by a Los Angeles jury on Wednesday of sending his 17-year-old son to kill rapper PnB Rock. \nFreddie Trone, 42, was found guilty of multiple charges, including murder, two counts of second-degree robbery and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery, after the Philadelphia hip-hop star was shot dead in September 2022.\nThe rapper was eating at a Roscoe\u2019s Chicken and Waffles restaurant in Los Angeles with his girlfriend, who is the mother of his four-year-old child, when the teen - wearing a ski mask - walked into the restaurant, demanded the artist's jewellery and opened fire. \nPolice said the teen removed items from the victim then fled in a waiting getaway car, which Trone was accused of driving, according to local media. \nPnB suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at a local hospital less than an hour later. \nProsecutors during the trial argued the teen was acting on his father's orders while Trone's defence team said he was only an accessory after the crimes. \nThe teen, who is now 19 years old, was also arrested on murder and robbery charges in the case but, according to local media, he has not been found competent to stand trial yet. \nA third man, Tremont Jones, was charged in the case and found guilty on two counts of second-degree robbery and one count of conspiracy to commit a robbery. \nBoth Jones and Trone are scheduled to be sentenced on 27 August. \nDuring Trone's trial, Deputy District Attorney Timothy Richardson told jurors Trone drove his son in a \"coordinated act\" to steal expensive jewellery, arguing the motive was about a \"half a million dollars worth of jewellery,\" according to Fox 11 in Los Angeles. \nProsecutors outlined that Jones had seen the rapper at the restaurant and passed along information to Trone as to what jewellery the artist was wearing, the outlet reported. \nTrone's defence team argued he wasn't there and never told his son or anyone to do anything. His attorney claimed prosecutors had zeroed in on the wrong person and said race played a part in his conviction, Fox 11 reported. \n\"Justice has been served for Mr Allen and his family who have endured unimaginable pain losing a loved one to such senseless violence,\" District Attorney Gasc\u00f3n said Wednesday after the convictions. \n\"Let this serve as a clear message to anyone who threatens the safety and well-being of our community: our office will relentlessly pursue charges and work tirelessly to bring offenders to justice.\"\nThe rapper's girlfriend, Stephanie Sibounheuang, said PnB saved her life in the incident, writing on Instagram after the attack: \"I'm not supposed to be here but [because] of him. I am\". \nShe described the traumatic aftermath of the shooting, not being able to ride with him in an ambulance and being forced out of the restaurant as police investigated. \n\"I feel so empty,\" she wrote after the attack. \"My world is dark now. My heart is broken for the kids.\"\nPnB, whose real name is Rakim Hasheem Allen, rose to fame with the release of his 2016 hit Selfish and had collaborated with artists including Ed Sheeran.\nTributes flooded in for PnB after his death, from artists including Drake, who posted a photo of the two together on his Instagram story.\nRapper Offset posted a Twitter tribute urging followers to pray for PnB's two children, with Nicki Minaj calling him \"a pleasure to work with\".\nPnB Rock was born in Philadelphia in 1991, going on to record two studio albums, Catch These Vibes and Trapstar Turnt PopStar.\nHe released his final song, Luv Me Again, just two days before the shooting.\n",

    "The debate over abortion has split countries for generations. While it continues to divide opinions across the world, protests outside abortion clinics in England and Wales could soon be banned under a new law. But what would that mean?\nSpeaking to BBC South, a nurse explained how the regular presence of protesters outside her workplace made her feel \"frightened\" to go to work, while another woman said campaigners outside an abortion clinic \"saved my daughter's life\". \nEmmie Isaac, a clinical nurse manager at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) clinic in Bournemouth, said the implementation of a buffer zone there in October 2022 eased her anxiety significantly.\nShe said when she started at the Ophir Road clinic five years ago she was not expecting to find protests on her way to and from work.\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said. \n\"I was dumbfounded.\"\nThe 31-year-old said the protests outside the clinic soon became personal.\n\u201cThe worst thing that happened for me was when I was chased to my car, being called a murderer... no-one goes to work to have that... it ends up impacting how you feel when you get home,\u201d she said.\nShe said she ended up having to change her daily habits - from avoiding leaving work on her own, to dealing with a constant feeling of worry.\n\u201cIt all just became really normal - frightening but really normal,\u201d she continued.\nIt was after receiving reports of \"alarm and distress\", caused by campaigners outside the BPAS clinic, that Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council decided to introduce a temporary buffer zone, banning activities such as praying and sprinkling holy water.\nMs Isaac said things had since changed considerably.\n\"It\u2019s just reduced that underlying tone of worry all of the time,\" she said.\n\"It makes going home much nicer.\"\nShe hopes the law is enforced as soon as possible.\nHowever, others are concerned about the proposed restrictions.\nSarah - not her real name - said when she got pregnant in 2017 she was sofa surfing, had no money and felt she had no option but to have an abortion.\nThe BBC was put in touch with her by anti-abortion group Christian Concern. \nSarah said she went to an abortion clinic for an initial assessment and was given a leaflet by anti-abortion campaigners. \nA few days later she decided to contact them. \nSarah said she was offered accommodation and financial support, and decided to keep her baby.\n\u201cThose women, being there, they saved my daughter\u2019s life,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf the buffer zone had been in place I would have gone to the clinic on that day and definitely I would have [had an] abortion.\n\u201cI would not have my daughter today and she is my best friend.\u201d\nA law to introduce so-called buffer zones in England and Wales was passed in 2023.\nOnce in place, demonstrations within 150m (492ft) of an abortion clinic would no longer be allowed.\nPro-choice campaigners have said the move would protect staff and clients at clinics from harassment and distress.\nAnti-abortion groups said it would curb human rights.\nThe law was expected to be implemented in spring but the general election was called.\nThe new government has said it is committed to introducing buffer zones around clinics \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.\nFurther details are yet to be revealed but temporary restrictions have been put in place outside some clinics across the country over the past few years.\nChristian Concern have been opposing buffer zones for a long time.\nAt the end of last year, the group lost a legal challenge against BCP Council over the implementation of one in Bournemouth.\nAndrea Minichiello Williams, Christian Concern\u2019s chief executive, said the group would oppose to the enforcement of the law.\n\u201cThe implementation of buffer zones around the country is a step backwards for freedom of movement, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to pray,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t criminalise the mere presence of people,\u201d she added.\nBPAS -  the leading provider of abortion advice and treatment in the UK \u2013 said temporary buffer zones helped clients and staff. \nRachel Clarke, the charity\u2019s chief of staff, added: \u201cAbortion in this country is legal. \n\"Ultimately nobody should be forced to run the gauntlet, past protesters and people who disagree with their personal legal choices that they're making, and have attention drawn to them, and [have] their medical confidentiality compromised in a way that I think we wouldn\u2019t possibly countenance in any other kind of healthcare.\u201d\nBoth BPAS and MSI Reproductive Choices UK said they provided a range of support to women, including  consultations with a specialised nurse and pregnancy options counselling, before they made a final decision.  \nAbortions in England were illegal before the introduction of the 1967 Abortion Act. \nThe Home Office has said it was committed to introducing buffer zones around abortion clinics \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.\nIn a statement, it added: \u201cProtecting women\u2019s rights is a priority for this government, and it is vital anyone exercisi",

    "A restaurant owner says she has been left devastated after having to close part of the building following a break-in.\nMasked thieves were caught on CCTV smashing their way into Viet80s, a Vietnamese restaurant and cafe in Friar Lane, Nottingham, in the early hours of 5 August.\nIris Nguyen said she was \u00a3100,000 out of pocket after the break-in and had been forced to put her plans of extending the business on hold.\nShe said recent unrest in the city and across the country had added even more pressure.\nThe 34-year-old, who lives near the venue, said she heard the alarm go off and checked the CCTV to see what had happened.\nThe footage showed three men arriving at the restaurant on bicycles, before smashing the front door of the cafe, located next to the restaurant. \nThey damaged a fridge before leaving with a coffee machine, cash and electronic devices.\nMs Nguyen said: \"I feel in danger - we were shocked and still worry about the situation.\"\nThe owner said she called Nottinghamshire Police, who were deployed to the scene before being diverted to a more serious incident.\nThe force said it spoke to the owner later that morning but the business \"no longer wished to pursue the matter\".\nMs Nguyen said she was upset by the response, adding: \"I called the police and nobody showed up. They have not come back to the restaurant since.\"\nA Nottinghamshire Police spokesperson said: \u201cWe treat all reports of burglary seriously and will continue to be guided by victims when carrying out enquiries into all forms of criminality.\u201d\nViet80s opened as a restaurant in 2018, but expanded its business with a cafe which also serves Vietnamese street food.  \nPlans for further expansion included new venues in Beeston and Bulwell but these plan have now been put on hold, Ms Nguyen added, and the cafe is closed.\n\"After the break-in, we had to close part of the cafe for a month. I know our customers feel upset about what happened and share the loss with us,\" she said.\nThe break-in came shortly after disorder in the city following demonstrations but is not thought to be linked.\nHowever, Ms Nguyen, who is originally from Vietnam, said the recent violence and break-in had made her feel \"fearful\".\nShe said: \"We moved here from London and when we first arrived, Nottingham was a peaceful city but it's scary now.\"\nHenry Nguyen, a barista at the cafe, said he had lost work as a result of the break-in.\n\"We need to make a living,\" the 25-year-old said. \"As foreign people coming to Nottingham, we work especially hard to stay here. \n\"I have lost around four to five shifts per week after what's happened.\"\nHe also voiced concerns about the recent disorder in Nottingham, which saw eight people charged with a range of different offences.\nOne of them - Victoria Gray - was given a suspended sentence while the other suspects are due in court later this month.\n\"With protests going on at the moment, me and my friends feel afraid to go outside,\" Mr Nguyen added.\n\"It's sad because we take pride in bringing our authentic Vietnamese culture to Nottingham. \n\"We love Nottingham, and are upset this is happening to businesses across the country.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "What connects a dad living in Lahore in Pakistan, an amateur hockey player from Nova Scotia - and a man named Kevin from Houston, Texas?\nThey\u2019re all linked to Channel3Now - a website whose story giving a false name for the 17-year-old charged over the Southport attack was widely quoted in viral posts on X. Channel3Now also wrongly suggested the attacker was an asylum seeker who arrived in the UK by boat last year.\nThis, combined with untrue claims the attacker was a Muslim from other sources, has been widely blamed for contributing to riots across the UK - some of which have targeted mosques and Muslim communities.\nThe BBC has tracked down several people linked to Channel3Now, spoken to their friends and colleagues, who have corroborated that they are real people, and questioned a person who claims to be the \u201cmanagement\u201d at the site.\nWhat I found appears to be a commercial operation attempting to aggregate crime news while making money on social media. I did not find any evidence to substantiate claims that Channel3Now\u2019s misinformation could be linked to the Russian state.\nThe person claiming to be from Channel3Now\u2019s management told me that the publication of the false name \u201cshouldn\u2019t have happened, but it was an error, not intentional\u201d.\nThe false article did not have a named byline, and it is unclear exactly who wrote it.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nA Nova Scotia amateur hockey player called James is the first person I track down linked to Channel3Now. His name appears as a rare byline on the site on a different article, and an image of him pops up on a related LinkedIn page.\nA Facebook account linked to James has just four friends, one of whom is named Farhan. His Facebook profile says he\u2019s a journalist for the site.\nI message dozens of their followers. A social media account for the school where James played hockey, and one of his friends, confirm to me he is a real person who graduated four years ago. When I get in touch, his friend says James wants to know \u201cwhat would his involvement be about in the article?\u201d. After I respond, there is no denial James is affiliated with the site - and his friend stops replying.\nFormer colleagues of Farhan, several based in Pakistan, confirm his identity. On his social media profiles he posts about his Islamic faith and his children. His name is not featured on the false article.\nNot long after I message, Farhan blocks me on Instagram, but I finally hear back from Channel3Now\u2019s official email.\nThe person who gets in touch says he is called Kevin, and that he is based in Houston, Texas. He declines to share his surname and it is unclear if Kevin is actually who he says he is, but he agrees to answer questions over email.\nKevin says he is speaking to me from the site\u2019s \u201cmain office\u201d in the US - which fits with both the timings of the social media posts on some of the site's social media profiles, and the times Kevin replies to my emails.\nHe signs off initially as \u201cthe editor-in-chief\u201d before he tells me he is actually the \u201cverification producer\u201d. He refuses to share the name of the owner of the site who he says is worried \u201cnot only about himself but also about everyone working for him\u201d.\nKevin claims there are \u201cmore than 30\u201d people in the US, UK, Pakistan and India who work for the site, usually recruited from sites for freelancers - including Farhan and James. He says how Farhan in particular was not involved in the false Southport story, which the site has publicly apologised for, and blamed \u201cour UK-based team\u201d.\nListen to Marianna read her article\nIn the aftermath of the false claims shared by Channel3Now, it was accused of being linked to the Russian state on the basis of old videos on its YouTube channel in Russian.\nKevin says the site purchased a former Russian-language YouTube channel which focused on car rallies \u201cmany years ago\u201d and later changed its name.\nThere were no videos posted to the account for around six years before it began uploading content related to Pakistan - where Farhan is based and where the site admits to having writers.\n\u201cJust because we purchased a YouTube channel from a Russian seller doesn't mean we have any affiliations,\u201d Kevin says.\n\u201cWe are an independent digital news media website covering news from around the world.\u201d\nIt is possible to buy and re-purpose a channel that has already been monetised by YouTube. It can be a quick way to build an audience, enabling the account to start making money right away.\nAlthough I\u2019ve found no evidence to back up these claims of Russian links to Channel3Now, pro-Kremlin Telegram channels did reshare and amplify the site\u2019s false posts. This is a tactic they often use.\nKevin said the site is a commercial operation and \u201ccovering as many stories as possible\u201d helps it generate income. The majority of its stories are accurate - seemingly drawing from reliable sources about shootings and car accidents in the US. However, the site has shared further false speculation about the Southport attacker and also the person who attempted to assassi",
    "A man who went on social media to encourage people to start a riot is thought to be the first person from Wales to get a conviction related to the recent disorder in England and Northern Ireland.\nRichard David Williams, 34, of Maes Deri, in Ewloe, Flintshire, was handed a three-month jail sentence for talking about taking part in a riot and sharing a derogatory meme about migrants in a local Facebook group dedicated to protests.\nThe metal worker admitted sending menacing messages via a public communication network at Mold Magistrates' Court on Friday.\nWilliams was arrested on Wednesday after police officers identified him as the man behind the online posts. \nHe admitted posting a message urging people to riot on a Facebook group called \"Riot/Protest re Deeside\" on 7 August that said a \"protest/riot\" would be held to \"keep our kids safe\".\nMold magistrates' court heard he shared a picture accompanied by a racist joke.\nHearing the case by videolink district judge Stephen Harmes told Williams he was \"a person who has little thought for others and the law\".\nHe said: \"We're in the second phase of harm to groups that had, from last week, been designated to be blamed for all society's ills by people like you.\"\nHe rejected Williams' description of himself as a \"keyboard warrior\" saying: \"You're not a warrior and neither are the rioters.\"\nHe said Williams \"tried to foment trouble and then tried to explain your way out of it\".\nHe said: \"We'll never be able to quantify what level of disruption your post caused, but it was part of a spider's web of disruption that caused riots up and down the country.\"\nThe chief prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, Jenny Hopkins, said: \"Williams wrongly thought that he could spread derogatory and menacing content from behind a computer screen. \n\"Despite not taking part in unrest himself, he used social media to encourage others to engage in violent behaviour.\n\"I hope today's result sends a clear message to those using the internet to sow division - your actions have consequences and you will be prosecuted.\"",

    "People in Wales \"need to be worried\" about the number of young people applying to higher education, according to university bosses. \nThe number of 18-year-olds from Wales applying to university is the lowest in the UK, according to data from Ucas. \nProf Paul Boyle, chairman of Universities Wales, said it was \"the biggest gap we've known in modern history\" and called for a Welsh government review. \nThe Welsh government said it was aware of the drop and said it was focused on understanding what it could do to increase participation. \nUcas data showed 33.8% of 18-year-olds in Wales had applied for university by the end of June. \nThe UK-wide figure was 41.9%. \nProf Boyle, who is also vice chancellor of Swansea University, said application rates had dropped in some of the most disadvantaged parts of Wales and \"we need to be worried\". \n\"That's our next generation of doctors, of nurses, of teachers, of engineers - vital cohorts who will come through and help the economic growth that Wales needs,\" he said. \nDespite cost-of-living pressures, Prof Boyle said maintenance packages were \"actually more generous\" than other parts of the UK. \nHowever, there has been concern about graduate debt - the latest figures from the Student Loan Company suggested the average loan debt for students in Wales was \u00a337,360.\nHe said data did not suggest more young people were choosing other paths such as apprenticeships either.\nTwenty-year-old Arwen Jones, from Maesteg, Bridgend county, was one of those who did opt for an apprenticeship.\nShe applied for a university place but ended up taking a marketing and communications apprenticeship, before going on to work for an MP, where she attended meetings with a former prime minister and worked on an election campaign.\n\"I don't believe that people choosing not to go to university is affecting the skill sets that we have as an age group,\" she said.\n\"There are other choices that people are making that are furthering their skill sets in a way that university wouldn't have the same strengths to do.\n\"I truly believe that you choose the path that's right for you.\"\nSwansea University holds summer courses in order to encourage more sixth formers to apply for university - even if nobody in their family has gone before them. \nThe Step Up programme runs events and residential courses to give those who might face obstacles a taste of university life. \nLillie-May Mullins from Townhill, Swansea, took part and is now in the second year of a criminology degree. \nBut the course also encouraged her mother to start a degree of her own, something she described as \"really nice\". \nShe said: \"She always wanted a degree, but she had me quite young, so she didn't. \n\"Then because I was going, she was like 'well, if you can do it, I can do it'.\"\nBut she said concerns about the cost of university can discourage young people and that schools should do more to raise awareness of the support for students.\n\"I feel as a 16-year-old  you don't realise all the opportunities you can get to help you,\" she said.\nOwen Robinson, 19, from Tenby, Pembrokeshire, is also helping out on the programme this summer.\nHis parents had not been to university so when Owen and his sister decided to apply it was \"a learning curve\".\nHe said going on to higher education was not \"normalised\" in his area.\n\"I think that's partly because there isn't a university in Pembrokeshire.\n\"So it's not normalised in the same way as it is in other places.\"\nRhys, 17, from Neath is one of the pupils on the residential course. \nHe said he was hopeful university would help him \"get a proper job to pay the bills and keep me afloat\" while he follows his dream of becoming a writer.\n\"I'm seeing things more clearly than I would have without doing this and given some solid advice,\" he said.\nThe Welsh government said it was aware of the decrease in 18-year-olds applying to university and were focused \"on understanding what we can do to further increase participation\".\nIt said the issue was \"broader than higher education\", promising an update on the government's policy response in the autumn.\nPlaid Cymru said it was concerned about the growing gap in applications from Wales compared with the UK average.\n\"We need urgent action from the Welsh government to address the decline in both standards and aspirations throughout our education system in Wales,\" its education spokesperson Cefin Campbell MS said.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said it was \"a worrying trend that must be investigated\".\n\"If we don\u2019t, we risk stunting Wales\u2019 future workforce of highly trained, skilled, and experienced professionals and severely limit opportunities for young people and future generations,\" Tom Giffard MS said.",
    "A police officer accused of causing death by dangerous driving after a pedestrian was hit by a patrol car has been cleared.\nCharges have been dropped against Sussex PC Christopher Corker, 40, in a hearing at the Old Bailey in London.\nIt had been alleged he knocked down and killed Arthur Holscher-Ermert, 27, in Peacehaven on 30 April 2022. \nHowever, at a hearing earlier, the prosecution said that in light of expert reports there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction.\nMr Holscher-Ermert was struck just after 23:10 BST and confirmed dead at the scene.\nFootage of the incident had been shown in court at an earlier hearing.\nPC Corker, of Worthing in West Sussex, had pleaded not guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving.\nHe had been due to face trial on Monday.\nHowever, prosecutor Jonathan Sandiford KC offered no evidence at Monday's hearing before Judge Richard Marks KC, saying that in light of expert reports there was no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction.\nIt had been alleged that PC Corker deliberately steered on to the wrong side of the road towards the pedestrian in a \"misguided and dangerous attempt to stop him running away\".\nHowever, the court was told of agreement between experts that the defendant\u2019s actions in steering on to the wrong side of the road would have avoided a collision had the deceased not changed direction.\nJudge Marks formally entered not guilty verdicts and offered his condolences to the family, saying: \u201cIt appears to have been a tragic accident.\u201d\nIn a statement after the hearing, the family said: \u201cInstead of attending trial today, we as a family have had to process the sudden news that the CPS are discontinuing criminal proceedings against PC Corker.\n\u201cThis is incredibly upsetting and disappointing...

    "As Tropical Storm Debby drenches South Carolina, the region\u2019s alligators and catfish are testing new waters - from puddles to backyard pools and the roads in between.\nIn a viral video, Robert Moose Rini watches from his vehicle as an alligator ambles across a rainy Hilton Head Island road before taking a quick break in a puddle. Mr Rini says he first saw the animal in the turn lane of the busy road.\n\u201cImagine walking around the corner and seeing that sucker,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s a common fear, popping up in dubious social media posts every hurricane season: predators showing up where you\u2019d least expect them. \nFake images of sharks in storm-flooded streets are so common, they have their own Wikipedia page. But alligators in backyards? Those are real for many Americans in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.\nWildlife experts say that alligators don't typically stray too far from their natural habitats. They stick to freshwater and like to burrow down when they sense a storm coming, the South Carolina newspaper The State reports. \nBut it\u2019s not unusual to see alligators and other wetland creatures where human neighbourhoods and developments such as golf courses butt up against freshwater ponds, rivers and wetlands. \nThis summer, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Alberto were credited with pushing nearly 200 crocodiles to explore more populated areas in Tamaulipas, a Mexican state that borders Texas, the Austin American-Statesman reported.\nIn South Carolina, several videos show alligators popping up on roads. One woman on Hilton Head told the Island Packet newspaper that she looked out her window to find she had a pool crasher - a small gator enjoying the shallow end.\nMr Rini, a South Carolina real estate agent, tells the BBC that he has lived on the island, a popular vacation spot, since 1981. He says residents try to avoid the lagoons alligators live in, but they're hard to spot among foliage and in murky water, especially after storms.\n\"They don\u2019t bug you if don't you bug them. But if they\u2019re there, you know - they\u2019re wild animals. They\u2019re unpredictable,\" he says, adding that he often has to warn out-of-town buyers with dogs and young children.\nThe animals inspire fear across the US coastal South, owing to their size, large mouths and prehistoric appearance. Female alligators tap out at around 10 feet, though male alligators can grow larger. And while they prefer to eat fish, amphibians and small mammals, alligators will snap their jaws at anything that comes too close.\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warns that even in neighbourhoods where residents have learned to co-exist with alligators, \"the potential for conflict always exists\".\nCrawl, a 2019 horror movie, depicts a Florida father and daughter fighting a pack of vicious alligators that invade their home through hurricane floodwaters.\nBut experts say that if treated with caution and left alone, alligators tend keep to themselves. \nIn fact, humans pose some threat to the species, which is protected. Drivers sometimes strike them trying to navigate roads in the rain. They can also get stuck and die in storm drains and other infrastructure.\nMost are just looking for a place to ride out the storm, Matt Kraycar, owner of K&K Wildlife Services told the Island Packet. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go back to where the food is and where they feel comfortable.\u201d\nThey\u2019re also not alone in wandering as Debby makes its way across the Southeast.

    "A man was stabbed to death on a petrol station forecourt because of \"bad blood\" between himself and his attacker, a court has heard.\nMohammed Duraab Khan, 26, suffered 15 stab wounds and died at the Texaco garage in Meadow Lane, Nottingham, on 31 January.\nHaseeb Majid, 22, of Wilford Crescent, The Meadows, admits fatally wounding Mr Khan, but denies his murder.\nOn Wednesday, the jury at the Nottingham Crown Court trial was shown footage of the incident, captured on CCTV covering the forecourt.\nOpening the case, prosecutor Michael Burrows KC said Haseeb Majid accepts he repeatedly stabbed Mr Khan, but claims he acted in self-defence.\nThe court heard Mr Khan had been the passenger in a black Audi car being driven along Meadow Lane when Mr Majid, driving in the opposite direction, did a U-turn and followed.\nWhen the Audi drove on to the petrol station forecourt, Mr Majid parked his blue Ford Focus in nearby Holme Street.\nCCTV shown to the court then captured Mr Majid - wearing a ski mask and a glove on one hand - walking towards the Audi driver, who was refuelling the car.\nWhen Mr Majid pulled out a knife the driver ran off and Mr Khan exited the vehicle and grabbed a steering lock before both men exchanged blows.\nMr Khan was stabbed four times with what is thought to have been a 12-inch (30cm) knife, before falling to the floor.\nThe footage shown to the court captures Mr Majid stabbing him a further 11 times.\nThe court heard the 15 wounds were inflicted in just 13 seconds.\nA post-mortem examination found one of the wounds, on his back, could have been enough to prove fatal, but the Home Office pathologist concluded Mr Khan probably died from blood loss.\nWhen Mr Majid was arrested he said he had recently suffered damage to his car, menacing phone calls and a threat that he would be killed.\nMr Burrows said: \"He [Majid] said what happened was the cumulative effect of what had been going on over the last three weeks.\"\nThe court also heard Mr Majid's ex-girlfriend had \"got reacquainted\" with Mr Khan in September last year, as their families were friends.\n\"There was bad blood between them - that is the motive,\" said Mr Burrows.\n\"Mr Majid did contact police, but he didn't say anything about what Mr Khan had done.\n\"Anger is no defence - taking the law into your own hands is no defence.\"\nWhen Mr Majid was arrested, police didn't recover the knife or ski mask, and he had changed his phone.\nHe said he had kept a knife in his car for protection, but on the day he approached the Audi at the petrol station he only intended to scare Mr Khan.\nConcluding his opening, Mr Burrows said: \"He [Majid] unsheathed the knife, he was plainly out to get him [Khan].\n\"Once he [Khan] was down on the ground he began stabbing him with repeated blows.\n\"He tried to hide his face. This wasn't to scare, it was an attack to kill.\n\"He fled the scene, he hid from the police - the knife he had used had gone, the phone he had was gone.\n\"This was not a man who had lost control, it was a man in control who knew he had committed murder.\"\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A former NHS dietitian has been banned after he was found to have put \"vulnerable and frail\" patients with diabetes and motor neurone disease at \"risk of harm\".\nDavid Brown \"persistently and consistently\" failed to maintain accurate records between May 2019 and February 2020 while working at Ipswich Hospital.\nFollowing a hearing led by the Health & Care Professions Tribunal Service, Mr Brown was banned from practising for 12 months.\nMr Brown, who is no longer working as a dietitian, acknowledged his record-keeping did not meet the standard expected but denied he acted dishonestly.\nDuring a two-day hearing, which the \"experienced\" NHS worker did not attend, a panel concluded several of the allegations levelled at Mr Brown had been proven.\nThese included not recording full clinical information from appointments with patients and not providing full clinical documentation in relation to interventions.\nHe also failed in reviewing service users in a timely manner, and he once recorded he had visited a patient in December 2019 even though they had died a month earlier.\nOn one occasion, Mr Brown took five months to record the outcome of a visit to patient\u2019s home, despite being required to do so within a week.\nThe panel said its decision to suspend Mr Brown for 12 months reflected \"the seriousness of the matters\" and helped to ensure public protection.\nIt said: \u201cThe misconduct had taken place over a lengthy period and there was continuous repetition of the misconduct.\n\"[Mr Brown\u2019s] behaviour affected a large number of service users and there had been an ever-present risk of harm as a result of his behaviour.\n\"The service users affected were all vulnerable and frail service users and there had been persistent and consistent failings in his record-keeping.\n\"He has not expressed any regret or remorse, nor has he provided any apology for his behaviour.\"\nMr Brown is no longer working for the NHS, having joined the Army in June 2020, but he has accepted the need for additional training should he ever return to the profession.\nHe has also claimed that personal and private issues, a large caseload, and difficulties using the system used to record information contributed to his failings.\nMr Brown has denied he acted dishonestly and said his visit to the patient who had died did take place prior to their death, but he had entered an incorrect date in \"error\".\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "When Sheikh Hasina called crisis security talks to put down spiralling unrest in Bangladesh on Sunday, she appears to have been in denial that her time was up as prime minister.\nWithin hours, she would be swept away by people power \u2013 indeed, few could have predicted the speed of her exit.  \nIn the end, it was the advice of close family rather than top security officials that persuaded her to flee, the BBC was told by her son.\nMs Hasina made her mind up just in time - crowds entered her residence within a couple of hours of her escaping.\nThe National Security Committee meeting - called for late on Sunday morning - brought the embattled prime minister together with the country's top three military chiefs, senior security officials and police. The mood was sober.\nPressure on the prime minister had been mounting for weeks as anti-government protests raged around the country. Hundreds have been killed in the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971.\nOn Sunday alone, at least 90 people lost their lives, mostly demonstrators shot by security forces - but also a growing number of police killed by the crowds.\nBBC Bangla has learned from officials that Sheikh Hasina wanted to keep \"two options\" open. While there were preparations for her to leave the country, she wanted to stay in power until the last moment - by force.\nMilitary leaders did not agree. On Sunday, ordinary people and protesters mingled with field-level soldiers and army officers in various parts of the country. After reviewing the situation, senior military officers realised things were out of control.\nIndividually, the military top brass at the meeting told the prime minister that soldiers could not shoot at civilians - but they could provide security back-up to police, sources told the BBC. Senior police chiefs also complained they were running out of ammunition, it later emerged.\n\"Police were exhausted. We heard that they didn\u2019t have adequate ammunition,\"  retired Brigadier General M Sakhawat Hussain told the BBC.\nSheikh Hasina, however, would not listen - and no-one was willing to disagree with her to her face.\nAfter the meeting, she delivered her defiant message. She called the protesters \"terrorists\" and urged people to resist those she described as \"arsonists\".\nSecurity forces feared they could soon have a situation approaching civil war on their hands.\nPictures of Sunday's violence were going viral on social media as the death toll steadily rose. Images of young men with bullet wounds, shot by police and members of the ruling Awami League party's youth wing, were triggering more anger.\nAs the ferocity of the clashes became clear, student leaders brought forward their call for a mass march on Dhaka by a day, taking the authorities by surprise.\nIntelligence inputs suggested the students' demands were gaining traction and thousands of people were planning to descend on the capital the following day.\nIf the security forces tried to stop the protesters, there would be another bloodbath.\nSo army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman decided to speak to the prime minister again.\nReliable sources said the three service chiefs met her on Sunday evening and politely explained that the situation on the ground was getting more and more volatile, and that crowds of thousands were expected in Dhaka on Monday morning. They could not guarantee the safety of her residence.\nSheikh Hasina did not take their advice, but journalists in Dhaka said they could sense power was already shifting. By Sunday night, police were absent in many places and numerous security barricades were unmanned.\n\u201cShe was adamant, neither would she resign nor was she willing to leave.  The three chiefs came, and they tried to make her understand about what\u2019s happening on the ground,\" Gen Hussain said. \n\"They said it would be difficult for the troops to fire on the crowd. They said our troops are also part of the country. They come from villages, they would not open fire on their own people.\u201d \nOn Monday morning, large crowds had started moving towards Dhaka. Gen Zaman was at Ms Hasina's residence once again explaining to her the gravity of the situation. People were breaking the curfew and violence had already started.\nPolice were being withdrawn from many parts of Dhaka and Gen Zaman told her they could not prevent the crowd from reaching Gono Bhaban, the PM's official residence in the capital, for much longer. An hour or so at best.\nAt this point, military chiefs decided to call on family members to intercede.\nPolice and military chiefs then held talks with Sheikh Hasina's sister, Rehana Siddiq, to see if she could persuade her elder sibling to leave.\n\"The officials held discussions with Sheikh Rehana in another room. They asked her to explain the situation to Sheikh Hasina. Sheikh Rehana then talked with her elder sister, but Sheikh Hasina was determined to hold on to power,\" the Bengali-language Prothom Alo daily said.\nThen Ms Hasina's son Sajeeb and daughter Saima, who bo",

    "If you're taking a flight on Korean Air, you might soon notice something missing from your menu - a cup of instant noodles. \nFrom 15 August onwards, the carrier will stop serving the noodles to economy class passengers. It said the increased risk of turbulence, narrow aisles and passengers sitting closely together could mean \"burn incidents occur frequently\".\nBusiness and first class fliers, however, will continue to enjoy the treat.\nThe snack has long been a passenger favourite and something the carrier is widely known for. Many praise the fact that it is available for free on request. \nIn a statement, the carrier said that since 2019 the number of times turbulence had occurred on its flights had doubled.\nIt added that in economy class, several cups of noodles are all served at once, saying that the \"risk of burns is greater with passengers crowded together\".\nBut in business and first class the snacks are brought individually to these passengers, reducing the likelihood of spillage in the event of turbulence, the carrier said.\nUp until now, the Korean carrier had been providing the noodles for free to passengers on longer routes.\nBut this will now be replaced with sandwiches, corn dogs, pizza and \"Hot Pockets\" - crusty turnovers filled with cheese, meat and vegetables.\nThe move sparked discussion on social media. Some users expressed relief, while others pointed out that the carrier was still serving other items that could cause burns.\n\"Aren't coffee and tea hot?\" said one comment.\nHowever, another called it a \"very good decision\", saying they had always been \"nervous\" that they would be scalded. \nOne user said they had hoped the instant noodles would be removed \"because of the smell\".\nKorean Air said it will \"continue to seek service methods that are safe while increasing customer convenience and satisfaction\".\nEarlier this year, Singapore Airlines said it would stop serving hot drinks and meals during turbulence as part of a \"more cautious approach\".\nA 73-year-old British passenger died and dozens more were injured when flight SQ 321 encountered turbulence over Myanmar and was diverted to Thailand in May.\nTurbulence is one of the most unpredictable of all weather phenomena, with severe turbulence becoming more likely with climate change, recent research shows.",

    "The Daily Telegraph leads with Sir Keir Starmer blaming the far right for organising violent protests that have broken out across the country since the multiple stabbings in Southport. The paper says the demonstrations have been fuelled by online speculation about the attacker's motives, including false claims he was an asylum seeker. The Daily Mirror says the prime minister has promised to take on the \"far-right thugs\". It reports that under the bid to stamp out what it calls \"the mob violence plaguing Britain\" - known agitators will be stopped from travelling, in a similar way to how football banning orders stop hooligans attending matches.\nPolice have been urged to step up patrols outside mosques and asylum seeker accommodation, according to the Guardian. It says at least 19 far-right rallies are being planned across England in the coming days. It says community leaders are increasingly fearful after attacks on mosques in Southport and Hartlepool and because of the actions of \"intimidating\" activists. \nThe Daily Express and The Metro picture the 17 year-old accused of murdering the three girls at a children's dance class after a judge ruled he could be named. Both use headlines declaring he has been \"unmasked\".\nThe Times is one those to report that prisoners serving whole life terms will be banned from getting married under a fast-tracked law. The paper has been told it has been brought in by the justice secretary to stop an application by the serial killer Levi Bellfield for a civil partnership. Bellfield, who murdered three people including 13 year-old Millie Dowler, had previously won a case to be allowed to marry, but the wedding was called off.\nThe first cut in interest rates in four years is the lead story in the Financial Times. It says the decision came in a \"knife-edge vote\" that marks a boost to the Labour government's promise to kick-start economic growth. It adds that the move is the latest sign of growing confidence among central banks that the \"post-Covid price jump has been vanquished\". The i notes that the interest rate cut will lead to a \u00a33bn drop in the government's own debt repayments. But economists have told the paper the move comes too late to ease the chancellor's plans for a spending squeeze.\n\"Say Goodbye to your doctor's appointment\" is the headline in the Daily Mail. It claims that patients face \"months of misery\" after GPs launched industrial action that will see some doctors drastically reducing their appointments.

A spokesperson for the doctors' union, the BMA, tells the paper GPs are \"at the end of their tether\".\nAnd there are plenty of tributes to Sir Andy Murray, whose defeat with Dan Evans at the Paris Olympics marks the end of his career.

    "There were \"missed opportunities\" to intervene before a toddler was murdered by her mother's boyfriend, a review has found.\nChildren\u2019s services at Pembrokeshire council were \"overstretched and morale was low\" prior to the death of two-year-old Lola James, a child practice review said.\nThe toddler died from \"catastrophic\" brain injuries in July 2020 after being attacked by Kyle Bevan at the family home.\nPembrokeshire council said its safeguarding duties were taken \"extremely seriously\" and had developed an action plan.\nSuch a review is held when abuse or neglect is known or suspected and the child dies or suffers serious harm. \nIt looks at the role of a number of agencies and bodies.\nKyle Bevan, 31, was jailed for life in April 2023 for Lola's murder, while her mother Sinead James, 30, was sentenced to six years for causing or allowing her daughter's death at her home in Haverfordwest.\nLola was left with 101 injuries on her body and Bevan tried to convince the jury she had fallen down the stairs after tripping over the family dog.\nThe report, commissioned by Cysur, the safeguarding board for mid and west Wales, covered the 17-month period leading up to her death.\nIt outlined seven \"learning points\" for the agencies involved and 11 action points.\nAn assessment of Lola by children's services in March 2020 \"lacked detail and analysis\", partly because her social worker was off sick. \nThe team leader acknowledged the assessment team was \"struggling under the pressure of the relentless workload\u201d.\nThe last home visit by a health visitor was on 15 February 2020, five-and-a-half months before her murder.\nJames repeatedly declined requests for visits, including two days before Lola\u2019s murder, when she instead had a phone call with the team.\nWelsh government guidance at the time stated health visitors should prioritise face-to-face contact for vulnerable families with safeguarding concerns, but the report said James's decision \"was not challenged or probed\" by the health visitor.\nIndependent reviewer Emma Sutton KC concluded the health visitor could have taken \"further steps to seek agreement for a home visit\", calling it a \"missed opportunity\".\nA home visit may have revealed \"concerning home conditions\" and been an opportunity to see if Bevan was living there.\nMs Sutton said it was only when all the different agencies involved were around the table that the chronology \"became particularly clear\".\n\"Had a true picture of everybody\u2019s organisations and what they were doing been there, then the circumstances and the level of risk would have been a lot clearer and different steps could have been undertaken,\" she said.\nShe added that the risk assessment process in Lola's case was \"inappropriate\".\n\"There absolutely is a need to not just accept at face value that matters are being dealt with. You need to be able to get through the front door,\" she said.\nHywel Dda health board said during the review that a health visitor at the time had an average caseload of 250 children and there were significant staff shortages and sickness due to Covid.\nThere was also a lack of \"information sharing\" between agencies.\nLola's older sister told her teacher about home life, but there was no \"ability to share sibling information between the respective educational settings\".\nBevan was known to the police after domestic incidents relating to his mum, as well as substance misuse.\nHe made a report to police in June 2020 that a threatening letter had been delivered to him at James's home and Dyfed-Powys Police knew three young children were living there, but the \"dots were not joined by police\" and a referral was not made to social services.\nMs Sutton said it was vital there were \"adequate staffing levels and resources\" and the children's services assessment team was able to \"respond to and fulfil safeguarding responsibilities\" going forward.\nThe report said several requests were made for more resources to be allocated for several years, \"including for the recruitment and retention of social workers\".\nBut it added the situation was now \"more positive\", with an extra \u00a3611,640 made available during June and July 2024.\nIt suggested professionals should be supported in asking \"probing questions of families\" and not simply accept what is being said.\nPolice should also establish a \"flagging mechanism\" for specific addresses where there is a wider history of safeguarding concerns.\nCysur said it hoped the report would \"contribute to wider ongoing learning and improvement in relation to a number of key safeguarding issues across all agencies with safeguarding responsibilities\".\nThe council\u2019s cabinet member for social care, Tessa Hodgson, said safeguarding was the authority's \"key priority\" and an action plan had been developed to deal with the issues in the review.\nNSPCC Cymru said the findings highlighted \"yet again the need for greater investment in children\u2019s services in Wales to provide comprehensive support to any child at risk of harm and to be better eq",
    "A helicopter pilot from New Zealand has been killed in the Indonesian region of Papua, police have said.\nGlen Malcolm Conning, 50, was killed by a pro-independence group known as Free Papua Organisation (OPM), according to police.\nOPM spokesman Sebby Sambom told the BBC that he had not been able to verify the Indonesian authorities' claim.\nIt comes nearly a year and a half after the abduction of another pilot from New Zealand, Phillip Mehrtens, who remains in captivity.\nAuthorities say the group responsible for Mr Conning's death is the same that is holding Mr Mehrtens.\nMr Conning was killed when rebels rounded up those on board the helicopter, including four passengers, after they landed in an isolated area in the Central Papua province, police said in a statement. The passengers are reported to be safe.\nThe spokesperson for the police special operation in Papua, Bayu Suseno, claimed the pilot's body was taken to the helicopter and then burned along with the aircraft in Alama District, which can only by accessed by helicopter.\nMr Conning was shuttling passengers for a private company.\nOPM spokesman Mr Sambom told the BBC that despite being unable to verify the claims, \"if it was true, then the pilot is a spy because we have declared that the area is a war zone\".\nIn February 2023, separatist fighters in Indonesia's Papua region took another New Zealand pilot hostage. Phillip Mehrtens, 37, was captured shortly after landing his plane in the remote mountainous area of Nduga to drop off passengers. \nSince then, Mr Mehrtens has been held captive by West Papua National Liberation Army fighters (TPNPB) - the armed wing of the OPM - who also attacked a number of Indonesian troops sent to rescue him, killing at least one.\nThese hostile acts come in the context of a long-running, often brutally violent conflict between the Indonesian government and West Papua's indigenous people.\nPapuan rebels have been seeking independence from Indonesia for decades, and have previously issued threats and attacked aircraft which they believe are carrying personnel and supplies for Jakarta, the country's capital.\n\nThe region is divided into six provinces and is separate from independent Papua New Guinea.\nPreviously a Dutch colony, West Papua declared independence in 1961. However, Indonesia took over two years later and was formally given control in a UN-supervised vote in 1969.\nThe UN vote is widely considered illegitimate as only about 1,000 Papuans took part in it.

I called the police to alert them that there were people there that need someone to pick them up.\u201d\nMarble and stone merchant Thanassis Kevezes had to leave his business in Vrilissia on Monday as the smoke and flames took hold.\nReturning to his yard the next morning he estimated that the fire had caused \u20ac30,000 (\u00a325,000) in damage.\nA major problem, he said, was the highly flammable pine trees that populated this area and much of Greece: \u201cWe love them as Greeks but at the same time I personally hate them now.\u201d\nIn the suburbs of Vrilissia and Nea Penteli, and further to the north-east in Varnavas and the ancient town of Marathon, residents and business owners are counting the cost. \nA pine forest burnt near Varnavas went up in flames and thousands of acres of farmland have been lost. Burning pine cones sent fizzing into the air made the task of fighting the fires that much harder.\nSotiris Evangelopoulos came to check the damage at his father-in-law\u2019s house on the very north-eastern outskirts of Athens.\nThe property, thankfully, was fine but for some damage to the front yard.\nOver his lifetime he has seen the summer temperatures soar higher and higher, and the season last even longer, while the winters have become warmer and shorter.\nMr Evangelopoulos criticises authorities for allowing the capital to expand further into the pine forests surrounding Athens, leaving people who live there more exposed to wildfires.\nKostas Lagouvardos, Research Director at the National Observatory of Athens, agrees that has complicated the situation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to find a solution because you have an expansion of the city towards an area where you have trees and forests.\n\u201cOn the other hand you have climatic conditions that change from one year to the other. We\u2019ve had three summers which are very hot and very dry and you have very large fires, not only in Athens, but in many other areas in Greece.\u201d\nFor now the firefighters are focusing on scattered hotspots rather than one major fire front.\nA fresh evacuation order was issued on Tuesday for part of the seaside town of Nea Makri, and flames approached homes in the nearby town of Erythros. The strong winds of Sunday and Monday were not as fierce on Tuesday morning, but forecasters warned they would build up again during the afternoon.\nMr Lagouvardos believes policymakers and engineers need to work with national and local authorities to find a solution. But he is pessimistic for the future, and not just because of the increased risk of forest fires.\n\u201cYou have implications for agriculture and health. You have a very long period of high temperatures in Athens this summer. You have many areas in the centre with high temperatures also at night which is a very bad problem for human health.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Daphne Tolis",
    "A woman has received \u00a335,000 in compensation after her rape case was dropped amid claims she could have had an episode of \u201csexsomnia\u201d.\nJade Blue McCrossen-Nethercott, 32, contacted police in 2017, telling them she thought she had been raped while asleep. She said she had woken up half-naked, finding her necklace broken on the floor.\nBut charges were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) days before a trial was due to begin after lawyers for the alleged perpetrator claimed Jade had sexsomnia - a medically recognised, but rare, sleep disorder that causes a person to engage in sexual acts while asleep.\nJade has now received compensation from the CPS, which said it has \u201capologised unreservedly\u201d.\nIt added that it was \u201ccommitted to improving every aspect of how life-changing crimes like rape are dealt with\u201d.\nJade said the CPS had \u201ctaken me to the darkest points of my life\u201d, and that it felt \u201clike a big triumph to be able to hold them accountable\u201d.\nHer lawyers, from the Centre for Women's Justice, said it was \"extremely rare\" for the CPS to make a payout like this.\nIn 2017, after a night out with friends, Jade woke up on a sofa with a feeling she had been raped while she slept. Within hours, she had reported it to the police. The suspect offered no comment when questioned and the CPS made the decision to charge him with rape.\nBut in 2020, just days before the trial was due to start, Jade was told by the CPS her rape case would not be taken to trial because the defence had claimed she had experienced an episode of sexsomnia.\nThe CPS explained that two sleep experts had given their opinion on the case after a police interview with Jade where she was questioned about her sleep habits. Neither expert had met or spoken to Jade.\nJade said she did not have sexsomnia, however, sleep experts were not able to rule out the possibility that she could have had an isolated episode on the night of the incident.\nDespite never appearing before a jury, the defendant was formally acquitted, leaving the case unable to be reopened without compelling new evidence.\nIn 2021, Jade lodged an appeal via the CPS victim\u2019s right to review system. In response, she received a letter of apology from a chief crown prosecutor, independent of the CPS department that made the original decision to close her case. \nThey admitted the CPS was wrong in closing her case, saying it should instead have been taken to trial.\nJade described the CPS decisions during this time as \u201cmore damaging\u201d to her than the night of the incident, saying the legal process had turned her world \u201cupside down\u201d.\nShe said her decision to sue the CPS was motivated by wanting accountability and to ensure \u201csimilar mistakes [were] not made again in these kind of rape cases\u201d.\n\u201cFor me it's not about the financial side of things. I'm very much wanting to push for systemic changes with the CPS and the legal system advocating for better training, policies, procedures and practices,\u201d she said.\nShe added: \u201cIt has taken a lot from me, but I held on to a lot of positives. I am really proud of the work that both myself and the Centre for Women's Justice have done to get to this point.\"\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, help and advice can be found here.\nKate Ellis, joint litigation lead at the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, said claims brought by victims against the CPS are legally \"difficult\", with payouts \u201cextremely rare\u201d.\nShe said Jade's was the first case she was aware of in which a rape victim had been awarded compensation by the CPS over a decision to discontinue a case before trial.\n\u201cIt's a testament to how severe the failing was on the part of the CPS that we have been able to bring this claim,\u201d she added.\nIn the year to March 2024, 65,913 rape cases were recorded by police in England and Wales (excluding Devon & Cornwall police). Of these cases, just 2.6% have so far resulted in a suspect being charged, or receiving a summons, according to Home Office figures.\nA spokesperson for the CPS said: \u201cA settlement has been reached with Ms McCrossen-Nethercott, to whom we have apologised unreservedly, and we continue to wish her the very best going forward.\n\u201cWe remain positive about the progress being made and recognise there is still a long way to go to improve outcomes for victims, so more people can come forward and report with confidence.\u201d\nJade said she was still waiting to hear from the CPS about the lessons it has learned from her case. She said she hoped her story would empower others to raise their voices.\n\u201cWe must hold these agencies accountable and we've done it now,\u201d she added.\nSexsomnia: Case Closed?\nWhen unexpected sleepwalking claims turn a rape case on its head, Jade fights back.

    "A man has been arrested after about 600 protesters from opposing sides gathered on the seafront in Dorset.\nSome 200 Stand Up to Racism demonstrators were on a different part of the Weymouth Esplanade than a larger group of about 400 anti-immigration protesters on Sunday.\nAround 30 officers from Dorset and the neighbouring counties of Devon and Cornwall were managing the two groups.\nAssistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan said there had been a \"small number of low-level incidents\", with one man arrested for a public order offence.\n\"This type of behaviour is not acceptable within our communities,\" he said.\nBoth sides were chanting at one another, with one shouting \u201csave our streets\u201d and the other \u201cshame on you\u201d.\nPolice built a physical wall, using themselves and about five riot vans to stop the two groups meeting on the road and the esplanade.\nThe anti-immigration group had been slowly moving towards Stand up to Racism Dorset, which officers were trying to stop.\nShortly before 19:30 BST, buses and cars that were at a standstill had moved on, with the road fully open around the King\u2019s Statue.\nMr Callaghan said he wanted to reassure residents and visitors that the demonstrations were well resourced with a strong police presence, \"including dog units, police liaison officers and evidence gathering teams\".\nHe said: \"The majority of people are behaving within the law and I would like to thank them for their conduct.\n\"Officers will seek to de-escalate disorder as quickly as possible and we will not hesitate to take necessary action against anyone who deliberately chooses to act outside the law.\"\nEarlier, one side had been chanting \"Tommy Robinson\", waving Union Jack flags and holding signs that read \"I [love] my country\".\nThe other group were chanting \"Weymouth and Portland welcome refugees\" and carrying placards reading \"Nazis go home\".\nOfficers were keeping people off the beach because some anti-immigration protesters pushed through the police line and ran up the seafront.\nAhead of the protests, Mr Callaghan said the force had liaised with protest organisers to \"ensure people can exercise their right to protest legally and safely\".\nHe said: \"We will seek to enable peaceful protests but, let me be clear, if people are intent on committing public order or criminal offences, they will be dealt with robustly as such behaviours will not be tolerated.\"\nHe said Dorset Police had increased resourcing for the demonstrations.\nThe Weymouth protests are the latest in a number of protests in towns and cities across England since the killing of three young girls in Southport, Merseyside, on Monday.\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who was born in Cardiff, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court earlier this week and was charged with murdering the three girls.\nHe was also charged with 10 counts of attempted murder after eight other children and two adults were seriously injured in the attack.\nHe was remanded into youth detention accommodation.\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned what he called \"far-right thuggery\" in the form of violent demonstrations.\nSpeaking to reporters at Downing Street, he said those involved would feel the \"full force of the law\".\nThere have been tensions over immigration here in Weymouth since April last year, when it was announced that the Bibby Stockholm barge would house asylum seekers waiting for their applications to be processed.\nThat caused a divide in the community and two groups formed - but both opposed the barge that is now berthed at Portland Port.\nOne saying they did not feel safe with around 500 foreign men, aged 18 - 65, being brought in to the community.\nThe other group felt it was inhumane to house people on a barge that they say is similar to a prison.\nIt has been protest after protest here since summer last year, with both groups clashing, so today is nothing different for the community of Weymouth and Portland.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "When Frank Sinatra sang about \u201ca city that never sleeps\u201d, he probably wasn\u2019t thinking about the economic boost that busy nightlife can provide to a metropolis.\nYet a growing number of cities around the world are increasingly homing in on ways to strengthen their night-time economy. \nAround 100 cities now have some form of \u201cnight mayor\u201d or \u201cnight tsar\u201d in place, to spur this work.\nBut most of those cities, including London, Sydney, and Sinatra\u2019s beloved New York, are not up all night. In other words, they don\u2019t allow bars and nightclubs to remain open, and serve alcohol, 24 hours a day.\nNonetheless, later this year, Montreal - Canada\u2019s second-largest city - is planning to take the leap into 24-hour nightlife. \nFollowing in the footsteps of Berlin and Tokyo, venues in a new all-night district in Montreal's city centre will be licensed to remain open, and serve alcohol, throughout the night.\nCity officials say the move will bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue. Currently bars and clubs in the city have to close by 3am.\nMontreal will become the first city in Canada to allow 24-hour drinking. In Toronto venues have to close by 2am, and it is 3am in Vancouver.\nIn the US, Las Vegas and New Orleans have long allowed bars and clubs to stay open all night. While in New York the cut off time is 4am, and in Los Angeles it is 2am.\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, pubs in London still typically close at 11pm. The city does, however, have a handful of nightclubs and bars that stay open all night, thanks to flexible licensing laws.\nOn a warm Friday evening in July, the centre of Montreal is bustling; busy bars and restaurants line the wide, pedestrianised streets.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for economic growth,\u201d says Ericka Alneus, the city councillor behind the 24-hour plan. \n\u201cBut it\u2019s also to present, and reinforce, the cultural scene.\u201d\nIn 2022, the annual financial value of Montreal\u2019s nightlife was estimated to be worth C$2.25bn ($1.6bn; \u00a31.3bn), according to advocacy group MTL 24/24. It says that from this, C$121m went in tax to the government.\nClearly, Ms Alneus hopes those figures will increase when venues are allowed to stay open all night.\nBut not everyone is supportive of the change: \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough security for it,\u201d says one concerned reveller.\nA fellow citizen is worried about the practical implications: \u201cIt\u2019s nice for people who like to party, but the Metro closes at 1.30am,\u201d she says. \u201cThere has to be some kind of way people can go back home.\u201d\nSergio Da Silva\u2019s live music bar, Turbo Haus Club, is located on Saint Denis Street in Old Montreal. He says the planned changes haven\u2019t been sufficiently considered.\n\u201cYou can't just say, 'here are some 24-hour bars, go nuts!'. \n\"There's no infrastructure to uphold it. There's no 24-hour public transport, there's no extra security.\n\u201cThen, there\u2019s the cost of living. If people can't afford to go out, no matter what 24-hour policy you put in, it doesn't change anything,\u201d he adds.\nAs the sun sets outside a different bar, L'ile Noire, owner Michel Lavall\u00e9e disagrees - he has a different take on the closing-time situation. \n\u201cIn Montreal, we close at 3am. People are drunk at 1am - and they're super-drunk at 3am.\n\u201cOne of the problems we have is, at 3am it's like madness. But if you expand the hours, there\u2019s less problems, less demand for security,\u201d he explains.\nMs Alneus agrees. She says the fact that so many bars and clubs all currently close at 3am presents problems for the police. \nShe believes by allowing 24-hour drinking, those venues that don\u2019t wish to stay open all night will be able to close at different times across the night. \nShe maintains staggering closing time will bring \u201ca bit more safety in nightlife areas\u201d.\nMirik Milan, a club promoter and festival organiser, was appointed as night mayor for Amsterdam in 2012.\nHe says that during his six years in charge, alcohol-related violence and reports of nuisance fell by 20% and 30% respectively. Those statistics, he says, were vital for local politicians to demonstrate to voters that \u201cwe really managed the night in a better way\u201d.\nMr Milan has gone on to co-found VibeLab, a nightlife consultancy advising governments around the world. \nHe says that when a city embraces nightlife as one of its key cultural assets, it can have billions of dollars of positive impact on the local economy.\n\u201cIt drives tourism. It brings in a lot of creative operators and businesses that want to be located in that city. And that has a huge impact on the city as a whole.\"\nLutz Leichsenring, co-founder at VibeLab, has been instrumental in promoting nightlife as part of Berlin\u2019s Clubcommission - the organisation which, since 2000, has represented approximately 280 nightclubs in the German capital.\n\u201cOne of the strongest arguments for nightlife is that it attracts talented and skilled workers,\u201d he says. \n\u201cIt's just a very important factor why people would relocate to a city, or would like to stay in a city and not move a",
    "The family of a modern pentathlete have paid tribute to a hard-working \"very genuine young man\", after he missed out on a place in an Olympic final by one place and two seconds.\nCharlie Brown, 21, had been called up as a late replacement for injured team-mate Myles Pillage. \nBrown, a University of Bath student, said he was putting his Shropshire hometown \"Cleobury Mortimer on the map\" and Team GB had been \"amazing\".\nFather Martin Brown stated his son was almost \"a competition animal\".\nThe student, who also has connections with Kidderminster in Worcestershire, began studying and training at the university in 2021 and studies sports management and coaching. \nThe five sports are shooting, running, swimming, fencing and showjumping.\nFollowing the Olympic semi-final, mother Liz Brown said: \"[He] absolutely loves people, noise.

    "A village in Nottinghamshire that became cut off by major flooding is to get a raised access road. \nHawton near Newark, was effectively turned into an island during Storm Henk in January.\nNow planners have agreed to modify the Southern Link Road being built nearby to ensure the village is protected. \nIt means a stretch close to the village junction will be raised with embankments on either side to maintain access if flooding returns.\nThe village is considered high risk due to its closeness to the River Devon, Middle Beck and Car Dyke, which all feed into the Trent.\nMichael Hirschl, who had lived there for about two years when the floods hit, said he was \"a little nervous\" about what would happen in an emergency with his 85-year-old mother-in-law living with his family. \n\"It felt really weird because it really felt like Hawton was an Island,\" he said.\n\"We've had flooding before when maybe one road was unpassable or just had a couple inches of water coming over the road. \n\"But this time it felt really strange and quite threatening so we were watching it on a daily basis, and on a WhatsApp group with the village, making sure everyone was OK as it came closer and closer.\"\nMr Hirschl added he felt \"confident\" about the flood alleviation work.\nAnn Sowerby, 81, has lived in Hawton since 1972 said flooding had never previously threatened housing but things were becoming \"worrying\".\n\"We were cut off three times this last winter all the roads were flooded - it was possible for big vehicles to get out but I didn't want to risk it,\" she said. \n\"It wasn't difficult as it was for a short time and I don't have to go out, but it is just worrying [thinking] about it getting worse.\" \nAnother resident, Mary Swindles, welcomed the prospect of a higher access road.\n \"I think it's going to be better for the village because we are getting a new road surface and a new footpath, and I'm hoping it's not going to flood anymore,\" she said.\nWork is currently under way on the Southern Link Road, a three-mile (5km) stretch of highway connecting the A1 at Balderton to the A46 at Farndon, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. \nNewark and Sherwood District Council recently approved the modifications, with the project being delivered in stages by developer Urban and Civic. \nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

The 24-year-old uniformed policeman had just come on shift.\nCCTV pictures show him strolling out past a guard post, his rifle slung casually at his side.\nSeconds later, a man in jeans and a dark T-shirt emerges from the direction of the white van, uniformed Israeli soldiers behind him.\nHe raises a handgun and shoots Abdel Nasser dead.\nSoon, the street is full of Israeli soldiers. They retrieve Abdel Nasser's rifle and, as his colleagues try to retrieve his body, continue to shoot \u2013 all captured on CCTV. \nWhen we visited Tubas the following morning, in late July, we found a makeshift memorial of stones and wilting flowers on the ground where Abdel Nasser fell.\nThe guard post and adjacent walls were riddled with bullet holes, each marked with a yellow tag. Fading bloodstains smeared the ground and doorway.\nIn a statement released on the day of the incident, the Israeli army said the shooting occurred in the course of an operation to detain two wanted men.\nAbdel Nasser\u2019s colleagues in Tubas said those arrests took place at a nearby house.\nThe army said that soldiers had \u201cencountered armed terrorists\u201d and that \u201ca customs officer of the Palestinian Authority was killed during exchanges of fire\u201d.\nFrom the evidence of the CCTV footage, this last statement is demonstrably false.\nAn Israeli security official contacted by the BBC two weeks later said the incident was \u201cone of hundreds, if not thousands of special activities that are planned and carried out very precisely\".\nThis one was being reviewed, he said, \u201cbecause it didn\u2019t go as planned\".\nIt seems clear that this was an operation that went badly wrong.\nNo-one has suggested that Abdel Nasser or the customs office were the target of the operation.\nThe young guard appears to have had the misfortune to stumble across an undercover Israeli operation, during which he was shot and killed. \nBut for Abdel Nasser\u2019s colleagues in the customs police, this tragic episode is part of a wider pattern of behaviour that is making it harder than ever for the Palestinian Authority \u2013 theoretically responsible for security in areas not under direct Israeli military control \u2013 to do its job.\n\u201cThis rings a warning bell, especially for us in the security services,\u201d Lt Ibrahim Ayyash, spokesman for the Palestine Customs Police, told us.\n\u201cHow can we enforce law and order and offer services to the people and protect them while you\u2019re obstructing my work and killing my officers?\u201d\nCustoms officers, he said, were increasingly reluctant to pull over suspicious vehicles, for fear of stumbling across Israeli soldiers operating under cover.\n\u201cIt now falls on you, as a custom officer, to take a decision about stopping a vehicle or not,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf you stop it and it has Special Forces [inside], they could kill you.\u201d\nAs fans of the Israeli TV show Fauda will know, undercover operations were already a regular feature of life in the West Bank long before the war in Gaza broke out last October.\nRecent evidence suggests the frequency of such operations have increased, with multiple cases of CCTV pictures showing Israeli units, dressed as civilians, and even medics, snatching wanted Palestinians from city streets and hospital beds.\nBut such clandestine operations are part of a much bigger picture.\nWith all eyes focused on Gaza, another war is raging in the West Bank, as the Israeli military cracks down on armed groups that it says are being bankrolled by Iran.\n\u201cThe situation on the ground is very, very complicated,\u201d an Israeli security official told me, on condition of anonymity.\n\u201cYou might say that it's on the verge of an explosion.\u201d\nThe emergence of a new generation of local armed groups, mostly in the refugee camps of the northern West Bank, dates back to about 2021, with the first group appearing in Jenin.\nBut the war in Gaza has fanned the flames of rebellion in other cities, from Tulkarem to Qalqilya and, more recently, Tubas.\nIsrael\u2019s security crackdown, the actions of violent groups of Jewish settlers and the belief that the Palestinian Authority is powerless to protect them have all added to an atmosphere of mounting tension.\n\u201cThey're very frustrated with Israel, they're very frustrated with the Palestinian Authority and they're looking for an outlet to this frustration,\u201d the Israeli security official said.\nThe PA health ministry says more than 600 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since last October. As many as 10,000 have been arrested, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society.\nAt least 18 Israelis, including 12 security forces personnel, have also been killed in the West Bank.\nOn Saturday, one Israeli was killed and another injured when Palestinian gunmen opened fire near the ",

    "Home Office minister Jess Phillips says she made a \"mistake\" in her response to a video showing masked men confronting a reporter last week.\nThe footage showed a Sky News broadcast in her Birmingham Yardley constituency cut short after men in masks surrounded a journalist.\nResponding to the clip on social media at the time, Ms Phillips said the gathering had been due to \"misinformation\" spread in the area.\nHer comments have been criticised by political opponents, including Tory leadership candidates Tom Tugendhat and James Cleverly.\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Ms Phillips admitted she \"would choose my words more carefully\" in the future.\nBut she added that she was \"trying to get across that this gathering of people had been manufactured by misinformation\".\nA clip of the broadcast, shared by Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice, showed a group of men gathering in the Bordesley Green area of Birmingham last week.\nPolice said \"a large number of people\" gathered in the area on Monday amid reports of a far-right march that did not take place.\nAccording to some social media posts, that crowd of mainly young Asian men was nearly 300 in number.\nThe clip shared by Mr Tice showed a man on a motorbike driving up to the Sky reporter, before swearing about the English Defence League (EDL) and shouting \"Free Palestine\".\nOther masked men then surrounded the reporter before making gestures to the camera, prompting Sky to bring the broadcast to an end.\nSharing the video on X, Mr Tice said: \"[Keir] Starmer and Labour no doubt think these pro-Gaza masked folk are far-right too?\n\"All violence, rioting and assault is totally unacceptable. Two tier policing must stop.\"\nIn response, Ms Phillips replied: \"These people came to this location because it has been spread that racists were coming to attack them. \n\"This misinformation was spread entirely to create this content. Don't spread it Mr Tice!\"\nAsked whether she regretted her response to the video on Wednesday, Ms Phillips told reporters: \"I think I almost certainly could have phrased it better.\"\nShe added that \"intelligence being spread amongst the community\" that \"people were coming to harm them\" had caused \"upset and fear\".\n\"Anybody, regardless of who they are, whichever flag they wish to wave, anyone being a thug on our streets should not be tolerated.\n\u201cOf course I would choose my words more carefully. I\u2019m more than happy to say that when I make a mistake, absolutely\u201d.\nMs Phillips's comments have been criticised by shadow home secretary and Tory leadership hopeful James Cleverly.\nHe wrote on X: \"Home Office ministers should not be making excuses for masked men shouting, abusing, and intimidating members of the media.\n\"Ministers are not commentators or casual observers, they are decision makers and need to think about the consequences of their words and actions.\"\nOn Tuesday shadow security minister Tom Tugendhat said Ms Phillips had chosen to \"justify\" the men's behaviour \"instead of condemning it,\" adding that Sir Keir Starmer should have sacked her for the comments.\nMs Phillips, who has represented Birmingham Yardley since 2015, has one of the biggest followings on X among Labour MPs.\nShe resigned as a shadow minister to call for a ceasefire in Gaza during a vote in Parliament last November.\nBut she returned to the Labour frontbench after the party's landslide election victory last month, when she was appointed Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls Minister at the Home Office.",
    "Thousands of young people in the UK were tricked into paying money for non-existent Premier League football tickets last season, according to an estimate by Lloyds Bank.\nIt said that football ticketing fraud against its customers was up by around a third compared with the previous season, and warned fans to be on their guard.\nBanking industry group UK Finance said that tickets sell out quickly, and criminals can take advantage of people looking for offers.\nIt urged social media firms to take more action to stop fraud, and asked customers to be vigilant.\nAbout 6,000 UK football fans fell victim to fraud last season, Lloyds Bank estimated.\nIt analysed its own fraud figures, and made the estimate about fraud suffered by customers of all banks based on Lloyd's market share - it has about a fifth of UK current accounts.\nThat means at least 1,200 Lloyd's customers were scammed last season.\nMore than half of the people getting scammed were between 18 and 34 years old.\nIts customers lost \u00a3177 on average, but for some people it was more than \u00a31,000.\nCriminals were most likely to target fans of the biggest teams, and supporters of Arsenal and Liverpool fell victim most often.\nAbout 56% of the scams started on Facebook Marketplace, and a further 26% began on X (formerly Twitter).\nEarlier this year Lloyds Bank estimated that Taylor Swift fans lost more than \u00a31m to ticket scammers ahead of her UK tour.\nCriminals create fake posts on social media or online marketplaces to advertise tickets that do not exist, often with pictures of real tickets to convince the buyer they're genuine.\nThe victim is then tricked into making a payment, usually by bank transfer.\nOnce the money has been transferred, the fraudster just disappears, and the victim gets nothing in return.\nThe problem with bank transfers is they are not designed for online transactions, so it is more difficult to get your money back once it has gone.\nThe banks can pay victims back, but the transactions don't have the same protections as buying something with a bank card, for example.\nLiz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds Bank, said \"missing out on the big match after falling victim to a ticket scam can be devastating\".\nShe advised fans to stick to official ticketing channels and to avoid deals that look too good to be true.\nUK Finance said fans should stop and think before parting with any money.\nIt said it was fine to refuse requests, and fraudsters will probably try to rush you or panic you into making a decision.\nYou get extra protection if you use a credit card to make a purchase between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000.\nPremier League advises fans to buy directly from clubs or authorised ticket partners.\nA spokesperson for the banking industry body said that last year customers lost nearly \u00a386m to so-called \"purchase scams\", with nine out of ten scams starting online.\n\"Tech and social media companies need to step up and tackle the criminality which is taking place on their platforms and contribute to cost of reimbursing victims,\" the spokesperson said.\nFacebook owner Meta and X were contacted for comment.",

    "Ben King was baffled when parking tickets started arriving in the post in December 2022.\nHe had allegedly been recorded parking in various locations across central London, racking up hundreds of pounds in fines.\nBut Mr King had never driven in London. On those dates, his hire car had been parked outside his house in Reading, nearly 40 miles away, and he had been one of the many victims of vehicle identity theft - known as \"car cloning\".\nA BBC investigation has uncovered a sharp rise in penalty charge notices (PCN) cancelled due to car cloning, with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) saying it is working with the National Police Chiefs' Council and other government departments to improve identification and enforcement of number-plate crime.\nCar cloning involves criminals stealing or copying another car's registration plates, often choosing plates from a vehicle that looks similar to theirs. \nThe scam allows unscrupulous drivers to accumulate fines while the innocent owner of the original vehicle receives the penalties. Victims usually do not realise they have been targeted until fines start arriving in the post.\nThe BBC investigation, based on a freedom of information request sent to all London councils, revealed a 64% surge in car cloning leading to fines being cancelled over three years. It found the number of cases rose from 22,450 in 2021 to 36,794 in 2023. \nOverall fines issued went up by 20% over the same period. All London councils responded, with the exception of Richmond and Havering councils.\nSome councils saw more than 1.5% of all their traffic fines linked to cloned vehicles. Hackney topped the list with nearly 2% of tickets issued attached to cloned cars.\nFor Mr King, the ordeal spiraled into a six-month nightmare that nearly cost him \u00a31,000 and brought threats of bailiffs to his door. \n\"I started getting these parking notices through from Redbridge Council, five more from the Newham Council,\" said Mr King. \"I've never driven in Redbridge or Newham, in fact, I've never driven in London before. I always take public transport.\"\n\"It was so, so stressful,\" Mr King recounted. \"We were up late at night, worrying about having to find a thousand pounds to pay these fines, what to do, how to appeal.\"\nProving innocence can be challenging for some victims. Mr King struggled to provide evidence of his innocence. \"I work from home, so I didn't have any proof that I'd been to an office,\" he explained. \n\"I submitted doorbell camera footage of the car on my drive, but they wouldn't accept that evidence.\"\nA spokesman for Newham Council said they had \"great sympathy\" with those who fell victim to vehicle cloning and said the authority would always cancel PCNs when drivers were able to provide evidence.\nA Redbridge Council spokesperson said: \"Motorists can always appeal and challenge a penalty charge notice if they believe their vehicle number plate has been cloned.\n\"In Mr King's case, he failed to provide the necessary evidence to support the claim that his vehicle was cloned.\"\nThe surge in car cloning is particularly evident in the context of London's Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez), a controversial scheme charging for high-emission vehicles to be driven in the capital. It was expanded last August to include all of outer London.\nA freedom of information request to TFL revealed a 69% increase in Ulez fines being cancelled due to cloning in the five months following the zone's expansion, which one expert believes may suggest more criminals could be using cloned plates to avoid charges.\nProf Jonathan Grigg, an expert in pediactric respiratory and environmental medicine at Queen Mary University of London, who is also a member of the UK Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution, noted what he assessed to be a clear link between the Ulez expansion and the figures obtained by the BBC.\n\"There is a moderate and significant correlation between the two variables for the years,\" he stated.\n\u201cIt likely that the introduction of Ulez has increased the number of cloning activities across London. One would imagine that people are trying to avoid paying the Ulez charges by cloning their plates.\u201d\nThe ease of obtaining fake plates is alarming. \nBBC London successfully ordered a plate from a UK-registered supplier online on Amazon, without providing any proof of ownership, receiving it within two days.\n\nRob Laugharne, chair of the British Numberplate Manufacturers Association (BNMA), warns of a growing crisis in traffic enforcement. \nHe describes the current situation as a \"wild west,\" with compromised integrity of vehicle identification systems as a result. Mr Laugharne highlights the increasing prevalence of Ulez zones and reliance on remote policing as exacerbating factors.\n\"It's a huge problem because that is the only way we're able to remotely monitor mobility in society,\" Mr Laugharne says, emphasizing the wide-ranging impacts of fake number plates on policing, counter-terrorism, and various systems including",
    "St Andrews University's rector has been removed from her role on the university court in a row over comments she made on the Israel-Gaza war.\nStella Maris sent an email to all students referring to \"genocidal attacks\" by the Israeli government, shortly after she was elected in October.\nAn investigation found she had \"breached her responsibilities\" to students, but Ms Maris said it set a \"dangerous precedent for freedom of speech\".\nShe will no longer sit as president the university court - its highest governing body - but will remain in a pastoral care role for students.\nMs Maris, a former St Andrews student, will retain the title and office of rector until her term expires in October 2026.\nThe university said the decision came after she repeatedly declined to accept the conclusion of an independent investigation into her comments. \nIt found she had made some students \u201cfear for their safety\u201d and failed in her responsibilities and legal obligations as a court member.\nBut Ms Maris said her removal showed \"a lack of respect\" for the rector's role in speaking independently for students.\nShe added: \"It is clear that I have been removed from court because I called for an end to Israel\u2019s war crimes against Palestinians, and I will not apologise for doing so. \n\"As a young, neurodiverse Black woman with limited financial resources, I have faced the full force of the university, including a KC investigation, all because I made a statement supported by the overwhelming majority of students, calling for an end to a genocide.\"\nChair of the university court Ray Perman, said Ms Maris was in \"serious and persistent breach of her responsibilities\" after emailing all 10,000 St Andrews students with her personal opinions on the Gaza conflict.\nHe added: \"We recognise that parts of the rector\u2019s statement were an important source of comfort to students affected by the conflict in Gaza.\n\u201cWe also wish to stress most explicitly that the rector has never been asked to diminish or change her support of the Palestinian cause, only to acknowledge that in her handling of this matter, she caused distress and fear to some students, whom it was her duty to support and represent.\"\nUniversity principal Prof Dame Sally Mapstone, said: \"We can disagree passionately on the most difficult issues, but it should always be with courtesy and respect for those whose views may differ from our own.\"\nMembers of the university court are also automatically trustees of the university - a registered charity.

He was cleared of all charges the following year after arguing self-defence. \nInstead of Trump, he said he planned to write in former Libertarian presidential nominee Ron Paul on the ballot. \nTrump has repeatedly vowed to protect Americans' right to own guns and to roll back Biden-era restrictions on firearms. \nMr Rittenhouse - who became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among some US conservatives during his trial - met Trump just a week after being cleared of charges in November 2021, with the president calling him a \"fan\". \nIn an online post early on Friday, Mr Rittenhouse - now outreach director for the group Texas Gun Rights - said that \"unfortunately, Donald Trump has bad advisers, making him bad on the Second Amendment\", which protects gun ownership in the US. \n\"If you cannot be completely un-compromisable on the Second Amendment, I will not vote for you,\" he said on X, formerly Twitter. \"We need champions for the Second Amendment or our rights would be eaten away and eroded each day.\"\n\"I support my decision and I have no take-backs,\" he added. \nIn a later post, however, he wrote that in the last 12 hours he had had \"a series of productive conversations with members of the Trump's team and I am confident he will be the strong ally gun owners need to defend our Second Amendment rights\".\nHe called his comments from the night earlier \"ill-informed and unproductive\".\nSoon after his original post, Mr Rittenhouse shared another post from the leader of the National Association for Gun Rights outlining the group's criticism of Trump's record.\nIt cites his support while president for raising the minimum age for gun purchases and openness to expanded background checks. Trump quickly backed away from those ideas at the time.\nThe list also included Trump's  2018 ban on bump stocks, an accessory that allows semi-automatic rifles to fire hundreds of bullets per minute, similar to a machine gun. The Supreme Court overturned the prohibition two months ago.\nMr Rittenhouse's video drew the ire of some Trump supporters, some of whom responded with expletive-laden tirades. \n\"The left hates you and now Maga will shun you,\" one user wrote. \nBut the former president's political opponents celebrated what some termed a \"break-up\" between Mr Rittenhouse and Trump. \n\"When you've lost Kyle Rittenhouse... Trump campaign is in trouble,\" posted the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group. \nTrump, now the Republican nominee for president, has repeatedly vowed to protect gun rights if elected in November's election. \nIn February, he told a meeting of the National Rifle Association that \u201cevery single Biden attack on gun owners and manufacturers will be terminated on my very first week back in office\". \nIn 2021, the most recent year for available data, almost 49,000 people in the US died of firearms-related injuries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe figure includes both murders and suicides.

    "Bangladesh is at a historic turning point.\nWeeks of anti-government protests have toppled its long-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina, and an interim government is expected to be formed.\nAfter Ms Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday, huge crowds stormed her official residence in Dhaka amid reports of looting and disorder in the capital.\nAt least 20 people were killed in the violence, adding to the more than 90 deaths on Sunday \u2013 which already marked the worst single-day casualty figure from any demonstrations in Bangladesh\u2019s recent history.\nNow, Ms Hasina \u2013 a former pro-democracy icon, who critics say had become increasingly autocratic during her 15-year reign \u2013 is in India. It's not yet clear if she will stay there or head elsewhere. \nThe protests began in early July as peaceful demands from university students to abolish quotas in civil service jobs - a third of these are reserved for relatives of veterans from Bangladesh\u2019s war for independence from Pakistan in 1971.\nThe campaigners had argued the system was discriminatory and needed to be overhauled. Although their request was largely met, the protests soon transformed into a wider anti-government movement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not [just] students anymore, it seems that people from all walks of life have joined the protest movement,\u201d Dr Samina Luthfa, assistant professor of sociology in the University of Dhaka, told the BBC last month.\nAs the movement expanded, clashes followed, and over 300 people were killed in the unrest.\nBangladeshi media and protesters blamed police for the spiralling death toll. The government, though, maintained that officers only ever opened fire out of self-defence or to protect state property.\nMs Hasina repeatedly cut off internet access in parts of the country, imposed a nationwide curfew, and described those demonstrating against her as \u201cterrorists\u201d seeking to \u201cdestabilise the nation\".\nBut the campaign of civil disobedience that had taken hold showed little signs of abating. And there were growing fears that a prolonged standoff could lead to more bloodshed.\nDiscontent was brewing for a long time in Bangladesh, and the protests didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum.\nThough the South Asian nation - which is home to 170 million people - was one of the fastest growing economies in the world, experts pointed out that growth had not translated into jobs for university graduates.\nEstimates suggested that around 18 million young Bangladeshis were looking for jobs and university graduates faced higher rates of unemployment than their less-educated peers.\nBangladesh had become a powerhouse of ready-to-wear clothing exports. The country sold around $40 billion worth of clothes to the global market. The sector employed more than four million people, many of them women. But factory jobs were not sufficient for the aspiring younger generation.  \nAnd that's partly why they wanted the quotas in government jobs to go - because that meant there would be more jobs for them.    \nEven after the top courts scrapped the quotas, the protests continued, spreading beyond students, because the brutal crackdown unleashed more anger against Ms Hasina's government.  \nHer rule had transformed Bangladesh with new roads, bridges, factories and even a metro rail, but there were also allegations of rampant corruption. \nPer capita income tripled in the last decade as more than 25 million people were lifted out of poverty over 20 years, accordng to the World Bank. But many felt that the growth was mostly helping those close to the PM's Awami League.\n\"We are witnessing so much corruption,\" Dr Luthfa said. \u201cEspecially among those close to the ruling party. Corruption has been continuing for a long time without being punished.\u201d\nSocial media in Bangladesh in recent months was dominated by discussions about corruption allegations against some of Ms Hasina\u2019s former top officials \u2013 including a former army chief, ex-police chief, senior tax officers and state recruitment officials.\nThe anti-corruption commission had began investigating former police chief Benazir Ahmed \u2013 once seen as a close ally of Ms Hasina \u2013 for amassing millions of dollars. He denied the allegations.\nEven as Ms Hasina promised to tackle corruption, she admitted that she had sacked  a household assistant for allegedly stealing $34 million of state funds. \nSuch shocking revelations didn\u2019t escape ordinary Bangladeshis, who had been struggling with the escalating cost of living.\nRights activists pointed out that space for democratic activity too had shrunk on Ms Hasina\u2019s watch - the government was accused of stifling dissent, silencing the media and government critics, and jailing or disappearing its strongest critics. But ministers denied the charges.\n\u201cThe anger against the government and the ruling party have been accumulating for a long time,\u201d Dr Luthfa said. \u201cPeople are showing their anger now. People resort to protest if they don\u2019t have any recourse left.\u201d\nIt's too early to say what Bangladesh's immediate future",

    "A homeless outreach service has expressed its concern after archways were fenced off at Bradford's Forster Square railway station. \nMany of them were being used by rough sleepers until they were blocked off sometime between Thursday night and Friday morning.\nHomeless Not Hopeless said it had asked Bradford Council what had happened to those who were sleeping there. The authority has not responded to a request for comment.\nThe council wants to install gates on the 10 railway arches, which are owned by Network Rail, to provide space for art installations as part of City of Culture 2025.\nSteve Richardson from Homeless Not Hopeless said: \"We're trying to speak to the council to find out what actually happened to those people who were still living there. \n\"Were they relocated or re-housed? We suspect that they were dispersed into Bradford city centre.\n\"There doesn't seem to have been any consultation with those people. It feels a bit heartless to us.\"  \nHe said Homeless Not Hopeless would continue to hold its Wednesday outreach service next to the arches as \"people know that's where we will be\".\nBradford Council has previously said its Homeless Outreach Partnership continued to visit the Forster Square arches on a daily basis ahead of access to the area being withdrawn.\nThis included drug, alcohol, and complex needs workers alongside specialists in housing options who are able to offer \"wraparound care to those who need it and to support them off the streets.\"\nIt had also offered accommodation to 225 people over the past year.\nThe arches are a surviving part of the original Victorian station, which was demolished and reduced in size in the 1990s.\nUnder the plans, the arches along the walkway between Cheapside and Forster Square Station would have 3m-high (9.8ft) decorated panels, with new lighting inside.\nThe council said the changes would lead to a \"much improved public realm\" around the station.\nNetwork Rail owns the arches and will fund the work, which was scheduled to start in May and be completed by late August but has been delayed.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "A man has been found guilty over the death of an Ecuadorian politician's daughter who was killed while crossing a west London road with her fianc\u00e9.\nVanessa Sagnay de la Bastida, 28, was holding hands with partner Michael Williams as they walked home near Wandsworth Bridge, when she was hit by Octavian Cadar's car just after 22:00 GMT on 16 March 2022.\nThe Old Bailey was told the 39-year-old had been driving at more than twice the 20mph (32km/h) speed limit, causing Ms Sagnay to somersault in the air and land on a railing.\nCadar, of Bexley, south-east London, was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.\nHe had previously admitted causing death by careless driving but denied the more serious offence.\nMs Sagnay, who was known as Charlotte, suffered a head injury and died at the scene about 13 minutes later despite the efforts of an off-duty doctor, the Old Bailey heard.\nIn a police interview the defendant, who was driving a Mercedes, suggested Mr Williams caused the crash by \"messing around in the road\" and pulling Ms Sagnay backwards and forwards on the crossing.\nHowever, when asked in court why he had chosen to blame Mr Williams, he said \"I was wrong.\n\"I was in shock during the interview. I said Mr Williams stopped and waved his hands about.\"\nMr Williams told the jury the couple had been holding hands as they began to cross Bridgend Road, having checked it was clear at the pedestrian crossing.\nHe said they got halfway across the road when they heard a \"loud revving\" sound of a car accelerating and backfiring.\nProsecutor Amanda Hamilton told the court the couple had then panicked and fled in different directions.\nMs Hilton told the court a forensic expert had concluded Mr Cadar's car had travelled at an average speed of 55mph (88km/h) from a McDonald's drive-through to Bridgend Road.\nShe said he was doing 48mph (77km/h) just before impact in the 20mph zone.\nMr Cadar accepted he had been speeding but said he had been focused on avoiding the couple who were crossing the road.\nThe jury deliberated for 42 minutes to find him guilty of causing Ms Sangay's death by dangerous driving, which carries a maximum life sentence.\nJudge Anuja Dhir KC granted the defendant continued bail until he is sentenced on a date to be confirmed.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Bangladesh\u2019s new leader is clear: this was not his revolution, and this was not his dream.\nBut Muhammad Yunus knew the second he took the call from the student on the other end of the phone last week that he would do whatever it took to see it through.\nAnd the students had decided that what they needed was for Prof Yunus - an 84-year-old Nobel laureate - to step into the power vacuum left by the sudden resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and lead the new interim government. He accepted immediately.\n\u201cI'm doing this because this is what the youth of the country wanted, and I wanted to help them to do it,\u201d he explains during a private briefing for select journalists at his office in the Jamuna State House.\n\u201cIt's not my dream, it\u2019s their dream. So I'm kind of helping them to make it come true.\u201d\nProf Yunus was sworn in on Thursday after months of student-led protests culminated in the fall of the government, and is still trying to gauge the scale of the job in front of him.\nMost pressing, he says, is the security situation. In the wake of the violence which left more than 400 dead, the South Asian country\u2019s police had all but disappeared - the country\u2019s police union had announced a strike, and traffic was being guided by the students, while hundreds of police stations had been gutted by fires.\n\u201cLaw and order is the first one so that people can sit down or get to work,\u201d Prof Yunus says.\nMonday saw the first glimmers of progress as officers returned to the streets. It is a first step, but security is far from the only problem.\nThe government entirely \u201cdisappeared\u201d after Sheikh Hasina fled the country, Prof Yunus says.\nWhat was left behind after 15 years of increasingly authoritarian rule is \u201ca mess, complete mess\u201d.\n\u201cEven the government, what they did, whatever they did, just simply doesn't make sense to me\u2026 They didn't have any idea what administration is all about.\u201d\nAnd yet in the face of the chaos is \u201clots of hope\u201d, Prof Yunus emphasises.\n\u201cWe are here: a fresh new face for them, for the country... Because finally, this moment, the monster is gone. So this is excitement.\u201d\nReform is key, according to Prof Yunus. It was a simple demand for reform of a quota system which reserved some public sector jobs for the relatives of war heroes, who fought for the country\u2019s independence from Pakistan in 1971, that sparked the protest movement in the first place.\nBut it was the brutal and deadly crackdown by security services which followed that saw it grow into demands for Sheikh Hasina to stand aside.\nReform is desperately needed, says Prof Yunus, pointing to freedom of speech - heavily restricted under Sheikh Hasina\u2019s government, the prisons filled with people who sought to speak out against her.\nHe himself alleges he was a victim of the crackdown on freedom of speech. An outspoken critic of Sheikh Hasina\u2019s government, Prof Yunus - lauded for his pioneering use of micro-loans but regarded as a public enemy by the former prime minister - was sentenced to six months in jail in what he has called a politically motivated case.\nBut there are other, more radical, ideas in the pipeline.\nEach ministry will have a student seat in it, an acknowledgement of the role they played in bringing the previous administration to an end.\nAlready, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, students who led the anti-government protests, sit in his cabinet.\nAnd then there is reform of the judiciary. Already, the students have put pressure on the chief justice to resign.\nProf Yunus argues the judiciary was failing to act independently - instead allegedly taking orders from \u201csome superior authority\u201d.\n\u201cIn the technical terms, he was the chief justice,\u201d he says. \u201cBut actually, he was just a hangman.\u201d\nThere will, he acknowledges, be decisions made that not everyone agrees with, but he hopes it will be better than what has come before.\n\u201cWhatever experience I have in my work... So I'm not saying I can run a government. I'm saying that I have some experience of running some organisations. I'll bring that as much as I can. There will be people who like it, people who dislike it. But we have to go through with it.\u201d",

    "Tens of thousands of women in West Bengal state marched through the streets on Wednesday night in protest against the rape and murder of a trainee doctor at a state-run hospital in Kolkata last week.\nThe Reclaim the Night march was the culmination of nearly a week of frenzied protests ignited by the brutal killing of the 31-year-old at the RG Kar Medical College last Friday.\nAfter a gruelling 36-hour shift, she had fallen asleep in a seminar room due to the lack of a designated rest area.\nThe next morning, her colleagues discovered her half-naked body on the podium, bearing extensive injuries. A hospital volunteer worker has been arrested in connection with the crime.\nResponding to calls on social media, women from all walks of life marched across Kolkata city and throughout the state on a rainy Wednesday night.\nThough protests were largely peaceful, they were marred by clashes between the police and a small group of unidentified men who barged into the RG Kar Hospital, the site of the doctor\u2019s murder, and ransacked the emergency department.\nPolice fired tear gas to disperse the unruly crowd. Some police vehicles were also damaged.\nSmaller protests were also held in many other Indian cities like Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune.\nIn Kolkata, women marched resolutely, holding placards of protest, their faces illuminated by the glow of mobile phones, candlelight and flaming torches. Some carried India's flags. They were joined by men, both young and elderly.\nDuring the marches and at many gatherings near a university, theatre hall and bus terminus, they stood united, holding hands as the humid air echoed with loud and powerful chants of \u201cwe want justice\u201d. Protesters blew conch shells - the sound is considered auspicious.\nAt the stroke of midnight, as India completed 77 years of Independence, the soundscape of protest changed.\nThe air filled with a spontaneous chorus of the national anthem. Then it began raining, but the protesters walked in the rain, or holding umbrellas over their head.\n\u201cWe have never seen anything like this before in the city, such a huge gathering of women marching at night,\u201d a reporter belonging to a news network said.\nIt was a night of barely concealed rage and frustration.\nA woman, who joined the march well after midnight with her 13-year-old daughter said: \u201cLet her see whether a mass protest can set things right. Let her become aware of her rights\u201d.\n\u201cWomen have no respect!\u201d said another. \u201cOur worth is less than cows and goats.\" \n\"When do we get our independence? How long do we have to wait to work without fear? Another 50 years?\u201d asked a student.\nSanchari Mukherjee, editor of a digital magazine, said she marched with thousands of others from a bus terminus in Jadavpur, undeterred by the rain.\nShe met \"people of all ages, from all classes, the well-to-do, the middle class and the poor\". \n\"I saw an elderly couple, the husband helping the woman to walk,\u201d she said.\n\"One family brought their little girl along, perhaps so the memory of this event would be etched in her mind - how her parents stood up against injustice, and how she, too, can protest one day.\"\nMs Mukherjee said the entire city seemed awake as the marchers passed by illuminated homes, with people peering out of windows and crowding verandahs to watch.\n\u201cThey may not have participated but they were with us in spirit,\" she said.\n\n\"'We want justice' had become the anthem of the march, and it didn\u2019t feel like just a slogan,\" Ms Mukherjee said. \n\"It felt like every young woman was deeply hurt and determined, frustrated that they still face these issues in 2024.\"\nMs Mukherjee added that she had to walk a few miles to join the march because the streets were gridlocked late at night.\n\"I was instantly swept up in a sea of people heading to the protest site. There was no excitement, just a stoic determination to create an event which would become a symbol for the times to come.\"\nThe protests have been fuelled by anger over local authorities\u2019 handling of the young trainee doctor's rape and murder.\nPolice later arrested a hospital volunteer worker in connection with what they said was a case of rape and murder. \nBut there have been accusations of cover-up and negligence. The case has since been transferred from local police to the federal Central Bureau of Investigation. \nDespite scant resources, Kolkata\u2019s Reclaim the Night march appeared to have been meticulously organised. In an advisory, organisers welcomed women and people from marginalised sexual and gender identities to the march.\n\u201cMen are welcome as allies and observers,\u201d the advisory added.\nThey also emphasised that politicians were not welcome and requested that no party flags be brought to the protest.\nIt was not the first time that a Reclaim the Night march has been staged in India. \nInspired by similar marches elsewhere in the world by women to assert their rights to walk in public areas without fear, a march was held in 1978 in Bombay (now Mumbai) in protest against the rape of",

All things we've come to expect during the Olympic Games.\nBut if you've wondered why two famous faces have been missing this time around, you're not alone.\nYou might even be one of the 300,000 people who saw Lee Cocker's post on X about them.\nMario and Sonic.\nSince the Beijing Olympics, the former video game rivals have joined forces in a series of tie-in titles starring characters from both franchises.\nThe mascots have sprinted, jumped and thrown their way through a collection of summer and winter Olympic events every four years, and their most recent outing took them to their home country, Japan.\nBut the world's favourite plumber and Earth's fastest hedgehog haven't paid a visit to Paris in 2024.\nIs it the end of an era? BBC Newsbeat tried to find out.\nLee Cocker was an executive producer on the series for 17 years, and worked on every game from the 2008 edition to the Tokyo version.\nHe tells Newsbeat the idea of Mario and Sonic starring in a game together would have been unthinkable in the 1990s.\nBut by the early 2000s relationships between once-bitter enemies Nintendo and Sega had softened.\nLee says he presented a prototype of the game to bosses of both companies and the International Olympics Committee (IOC), and all of them were impressed.\nThe first game was a huge success, selling about 26 million copies, according to Lee.\n\"It was two of the most iconic video game characters coming together at the Olympics,\" he says. \n\"And it was on the Wii.\" \nAt the time, the Nintendo console with motion-control capabilities was a sensation, outselling rivals PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\nIt was also incredibly popular with families. So a game everyone could gather around the TV to play was an easy sell.\n\"It was a perfect storm,\" says Lee.\nWhile the sequels never quite matched the sales of the first game, they remained popular.\nAnd when Lee posted on X to confirm that there would be no Paris version the response was huge.\n\"My Twitter blew up, my social media blew up, my emails blew up,\" he says. \n\"Loads of people messaging me, saying: 'We love that game. We grew up on that game'.\"\nDespite this, Lee says the licence wasn't renewed for 2024, and the understanding was that the IOC wanted to work with a new partner.\n\"Think of it as a cake,\" he says. \n\"Everyone has to get a piece - the IOC, Nintendo, Sega - so if they're doing it with another company, they get a bigger percentage.\"\nLee says he had expected Ubisoft, the French gaming giant known for franchises including the family friendly Rayman and Rabbids series, to be chosen.\nIn the end the IOC went for nWay, a developer with offices in San Francisco and South Korea.\nThey've produced a mobile game, Olympics Go!, which Lee says is \"very good\", but would have been produced on a much smaller budget.\nLee says the IOC also wanted to explore the use of NFTs - the short-lived crypto-powered token - and esports.\nThere's been criticism of the sports body for this, but Lee says it's understandable that it would want to reach new audiences by using emerging technologies.\nBut he admits he'd have been keen to explore what could have been with a Paris 2024 edition of Mario and Sonic.\n\"What I always liked about Mario and Sonic and working on it was introducing new sports,\" he says. \n\"Breakdancing is an Olympic sport this year. \n\"How good would it have been to see Mario and Sonic doing breakdancing? Bowser spinning on his shell or something?\" \nAnother group of people upset by the lack of a new Mario and Sonic game are speedrunners - players who spend hours competing to log the best times in the games' different events.\nAlthough the series was a fun family hit, speedrunning has a dedicated community built around it.\nJH2000, who holds two world records in the Winter Olympics versions, says there's a surprising amount of depth to the titles.\n\"Each character has its own set of stats,\" he says. \n\"You've got your speed characters, the all-around characters, the technical characters and the power characters. \n\"And each one has their own feel in different events.\"\nJH says the speedrun community was \"gutted\" when they learned Mario and Sonic wouldn't be heading for Paris.\n\"When we heard nothing about it we were completely and utterly gutted,\" he says.\n\"We just thought, 'we can't just end like this'. \n\"We heard nothing, so we just thought, OK, maybe it's coming out later, until we found out it wasn't.\"\nAll hope might not be lost. When BBC Newsbeat asked the IOC for an explanation as to why there was no Paris version of Mario and Sonic, it blamed \"tight timelines after the postponed Olympic Games Tokyo 2020\". \n\"However the Tokyo edition is available and very popular. Watch this space for the future,\" they added.\nLee is less optimistic about the characters qualifying for another Olympics, but says the big thing for him is the legacy of the games he did get to make.\n\"These two videogame characters coming together for the Olympics, that's ",
    "In the hotly divided US presidential campaign, a rare area of agreement has emerged: Workers\u2019 tips should not be taxed.\nFormer president Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, was first out of the gate with the proposal, announcing it at a rally in June. \nVice-president Kamala Harris, the Democratic opponent, came out in favour of the plan this weekend, earning her the nickname \u201cCopy Cat Kamala\u201d from the Trump campaign. \nIt is a proposal intended to win attention for the candidates from Americans who work in service industries \u2013 restaurant workers, bartenders, hairdressers, manicurists, taxi drivers and others, who often receive a significant portion of their income in tips. \nBoth candidates announced their support for the idea in Nevada, a state seen as a toss-up in the election.\nRestaurants and hotels employ more than 20% of the workforce in the state, which is known for its Las Vegas casinos.\nMr Trump said he started to champion the policy after a waitress complained to him about her taxes.\nRepublicans, who have long favoured lower taxes, adopted it as part of their official party platform and several bills are now circulating in Congress, backed by restaurant lobby groups. \nSome Democrats also have voiced support - including President Joe Biden, whose press secretary said that he backed the idea a day after Ms Harris endorsed the plan.\nThe discussion comes as electronic payments make tips easier to trace, raising the risk of failing to report or under-reporting such income, an historically common problem.\nFor all the buzz that ending taxes on tips has generated, however, it is a relatively niche issue.\nNationally, an estimated 4 million workers regularly receive tips \u2013 less than 3% of the overall workforce, according to an analysis by Yale University's Budget Lab.\nWhat\u2019s more, a significant share of those workers \u2013 about 37% - earn so little that they do not currently pay income taxes to the federal government at all, the analysis found.\nUnder the current law, employees are required to disclose all tips over $20 per month to their employer.\nThe federal government then collects a share via income and payroll taxes, which fund programmes such as Social Security. (States also have their own rules about income tax.)\nAmericans reported $38bn in tip income to the federal government in fiscal year 2018, the most recent year for which there is data. \nOn average, that amounted to just over $6,000 in income per taxpayer. \nFor some servers, however, tips can account for more than half of their hourly earnings, according to estimates from the National Employment Law Project.\nThe financial impact is unclear: Some of the proposals in Congress focus exclusively on income tax; others would exempt tips from both income and payroll tax. \nThe candidates themselves have been vague. \nThe Tax Foundation estimates that any change would cost at least $107bn over a decade and other estimates are higher.\nBut though eliminating taxes on tips might sound straight-forward politically, some analysts say that does not make it good policy.\nThey argue that it would unfairly shift the tax burden to workers who do not receive tips.\nIt also could encourage tipping to expand to new professions, which could lead to a much bigger financial impact than expected.\nOthers argue that cutting taxes on tips would benefit employers more than workers by distracting from the real issue: that businesses do not have to pay minimum wage to staff who receive tips.",
    "A man who spent his youth training to work in occupational health before turning to gardening has won a prestigious award.\nChris Reeve, 50, from Ipswich turned his hobby into a career after he lost his mum to cancer.\nHis first job was working at Helmingham Hall near Stowmarket and he is still working there after 25 years, delighting visitors with his plant topiary sculptures.\nMr Reeve's creations - including a giant frog prince - led to him winning second place in the Henchman inaugural Topiary Awards for 2024.\nExplaining how he got into gardening, Mr Reeve said: \"I was actually going to go into a medical profession, I was studying to become an occupational therapist.\n\"I'd done physiotherapy at Ipswich Hospital, I'd done health care assistant work, caring for the elderly and that was the whole trajectory I'd have.\n\"Unfortunately in 1994 I lost my mum to cancer and it became increasingly hard to continue working in hospitals because I'd just see the patient in the bed as mum.\n\"It was a horrible time in my life.\"\nMr Reeve left his course and turned to gardening.\nDespite not being too keen to start with, he studied environmental landscape management, design and conservation at Otley College, which is now known as Suffolk Rural as part of Suffolk New College.\nAfter three years, his first job took him to Helmingham Hall where the former head gardener noticed Mr Reeve had \"an eye for topiaries\".\nHe developed his skill and has created several sculptures in the grounds, including a frog, an old work boot and even a snowman.\nMr Reeve found out about the Henchman Topiary Awards via a newsletter from the Professional Gardeners' Guild and said he thought: \"Why not?\"\nHe won second place in the professional gardener category and took home a bundle of Henchman prizes. \nAsked why he loved topiary so much, Mr Reeve added: \"It's just the creativity of it.\n\"You've got a standard hedge that most people will clip into a ball, a box or a small hedgerow but you can do so much more with it.\"\nMr Reeve and Helmingham Hall are working to create more topiaries on the grounds, as well as to inspire more children into gardening and horticulture.\nHe felt there was a lack of education around the career in schools.\n\"It's a big void, really. There's a skills shortage coming up behind the younger members of staff.\"\n\"It's such a valuable job, especially going forward into the future where nature and horticulture is so very important to us all.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Controversial plans to scrap free parking in parts of south Suffolk are to go ahead. \nBabergh District Council will bring in short-term parking charges in Sudbury, Hadleigh and Lavenham to help offset a \u00a36.7m budget gap predicted over the next four years.\nThe authority approved the plans after a review, following criticism from councillors. \nThe decision was made at a cabinet meeting with the council admitting that there was going to be some \"kick back\".\nThe plans would mean people having to pay \u00a31 for short-stay parking for the first hour, or \u00a31 for two hours in long-stay parking.\nThe council said the fees were lower than those of neighbouring authorities and there were no plans to introduce charges on Sundays or bank holidays.\nBlue badge holders will continue to be allowed to park for free for up to 3 hours in any bay of all public car parks.\nJohn Ward, the cabinet member for finance at the Independent coalition-led council, said he understands some people's concerns but that the authority could not afford to provide free parking.\n\"You're asking people to pay for something that they've never had to pay for before, naturally there is going to be kick back,\" he said.\n\"Nothing is for free, somebody, somewhere, sometime has to pay for it and why not the person who uses it at the point of use.\"\n\nHowever, there have been fears the charges would reduce the number of people heading to the town and village centres as well as putting off employees of retail businesses.\nA petition against the plans had more than 8,000 signatures.\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Conservative councillor Paul Clover told the cabinet that it was \"prepared to gamble with the livelihoods of the residents they represent and the economies of our local towns and stakeholders.\u201d\nGreen Party councillor Jessie Carter added: \u201cWe have the opportunity to help our businesses, to support our high streets, our community groups, and our residents, and that\u2019s what we should be doing.\u201d\nCouncil leaders said the money generated from the parking charges would not be enough to cover the budget shortfall and other savings would be needed. \nHowever, it could take six months for the charges to be introduced. \nThe council said it will be monitoring the impacts of the charges.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Tens of thousands of people participated in a \"Reclaim the Night\" march in the Indian city of Kolkata on Wednesday night to protest against last week's rape and murder of a trainee doctor. \nThe march, largely led by women, demanded justice for the 31-year-old victim who worked at the RG Kar Medical College. She was brutally attacked on Friday, sparking protests and anger across the country.\nDevalina Bose, 27, an intern at the same hospital, told the BBC that she joined the protest as she was hurt and angry because of what happened to her colleague.\nHere is Devalina in her own words.\nI\u2019m still traumatised by what happened to the victim. I struggle to sleep at night.\nI keep thinking about how just three weeks back, I had taken a short nap in a room just a few meters away from where the rape and murder happened.\nI was tired that night after being on my feet for hours and I just wanted to take a nap. But the room didn\u2019t have a lock and so I couldn\u2019t bolt the door shut.\nI was alone in the room and, for a second, I worried about my safety.\nBut then I pushed the thought out of my head because I told myself that my colleagues were close-by and nothing untoward could possibly happen to me in a hospital.\nBut now, I don\u2019t feel this way anymore.\nEvery time I\u2019m on shift, I catch myself looking over my shoulder, scanning the room for unsafe faces, voices\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for but I\u2019m always on the edge.\nWhat happened to her is just unimaginable. How could a doctor on duty be subjected to something so horrific? So inhuman?\nDoctors save people\u2019s lives. They give people a second - sometimes a third - lease on life.\nSo last night, I joined all my colleagues on the street. My parents didn\u2019t want me to participate in the march because they were worried about my safety.\nBut I told them that they should encourage me instead, because women have the right to be out in the streets at night and to feel safe.\nWomen have the right to be anywhere they choose to, doing whatever they choose to, without having to worry about their safety. We have a right to the night like anybody else.\nThat's why I joined the protest. To mark this idea and to force people to see it, understand it and believe it.\nI saw so many people, of all ages, participate in the march.\nThere were several generations of women out in the streets - grandmothers, mothers, daughters - holding placards, candles, shouting slogans for justice and change. Some were just walking along silently, perhaps soaking it all in.\nMy female professors and staff from the hospital were also out to protest.\nPeople from the building I stay in were also participating in a march organised by our society.\nIt was the first time I saw people I never thought would participate in a march in the night.\nI thought it was so special and so powerful.\nI walked along with my female friends and even though I attended just one protest march, I felt connected to the hundreds of marches being held simultaneously across the state.\nMy friends from other places shared videos of their marches with me. I shared photos and videos of mine.\nIn those few moments, we all felt connected - united in our anger and desire for change.\nI think this incident has ignited so much rage and touched so many people.\nOften in our society, many people tend to blame the victim. They say 'why was she out with a guy?' or 'why was she wearing that dress?' or 'why was she out at that hour in the night?'\nIt is reprehensible to hold a woman accountable for the man's actions in any case. Now many of us are wondering who will people blame?\nIt\u2019s time we as a society took a step back and asked ourselves this question: whose fault is rape, really?\nAs told to Cherylann Mollan\nDevalina didn't want her photo to be used in this piece",
    "In a country where women still find it challenging to reach high office, the swing state of Michigan is an outlier.\nIts three most senior elected officials are all women - nationally women fill only around a quarter of senior political roles.\nWith no woman having ever served as president, the state run by women could offer pointers for a route to the White House for Democrat Kamala Harris.\nOpinion polling does not offer a clear answer on whether people are less willing to vote for a woman, but they certainly end up electing fewer overall.\nAnd you don\u2019t have to look far to find the perception that women still have to fight harder to get elected.\nRobyn Kepplinger may be one of the few in her pro-gun, anti-abortion rural western Michigan town who is thrilled at the chance to vote for a Democratic woman for president.\nThe 33-year-old says she could not imagine a better candidate to lead the country \"in the direction that we need to go\".\nListen to Madeline read this article\nMs Kepplinger, a resident of Jenison, has thrown her support behind Vice-President Harris. On Friday, the 59-year-old secured enough delegate votes to become Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to drop out of the race on 21 July.\nBut even some Harris fans worry that being a woman could be a significant obstacle between her and the presidency. \u201cFor anyone to be doing something that has not been done before, it's difficult,\u201d Ms Kepplinger said. \u201cI don't think that most people are behind a change as drastic as a female leader.\u201d\nSuch a change, however, has proven possible in the key battleground state of Michigan, where three female Democrats now hold the top positions: Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and Attorney General Dana Nessel. In fact, Michigan has had two female Democratic governors in the past 20 years, Jennifer Granholm and Ms Whitmer.\nOnly around a quarter of senators and state governors in the US are women. The figure for representatives is slightly higher at 29%.\n\u201cWomen are still underestimated,\u201d said Marcie Paul, the chair of Fems for Dems, an advocacy group for liberal women in Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be no different for her [Ms Harris], I believe, than it was when they said three women on the top of the ticket cannot possibly win in Michigan.\u201d\nMs Harris, however, shares some of the traits that made women in Michigan successful candidates, according to Kim Gates, Democratic chair of Kent County, Michigan.\nMs Harris, Ms Whitmer and Ms Granholm managed to strike a balance between compassion and strength as \u201cstraight-talking, strong women\u201d, Ms Gates said.\n\u201cThey have great speaking skills. They\u2019re able to sound like they\u2019re talking to the average person,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re compassionate.\u201d\nCombining straight-talking, strength and compassion is easier said than done, but if Ms Harris can, it may bode well for her.\nFemale candidates may also prove more adept than men at galvanising voters around the issue of reproductive rights after the fall of Roe v Wade.\nVoters nationwide cite abortion rights among the most important election issues, with one recent poll from KFF finding 1 in 8 voters saw it as a top priority for November. The issue has been relevant at the polls, with anti-abortion advocates losing a series of contests in Republican states since the federal right to abortion was overturned in 2022. In the past two years, a handful of states have passed ballot measures protecting the right to abortion, including in the Republican strongholds of Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio.\nThe cause helped propel Ms Whitmer to victory in her race for re-election in Michigan in 2022, the same year Michigan residents voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution. During Ms Harris\u2019 tenure, she has shown a strong focus on reproductive rights, recently visiting a clinic that provides abortions.\nIt\u2019s an area where her gender could prove an advantage, said Adrian Hemond, a political strategist in Michigan.\n\u201cVice-President Harris is a much better messenger on that issue than Joe Biden,\u201d he said.\nAs concerns grew around 81-year-old Mr Biden\u2019s ability to beat Trump in November, some major donors paused funds when the president\u2019s poll numbers were falling in swing states, including Michigan.\nMeanwhile, Trump, 78, also saw a boost in personal ratings after a gunman attempted to assassinate him at a rally in Pennsylvania last month.\nBut after Mr Biden stepped down, Ms Harris received a record level of donations - $81m (\u00a363m) within 24 hours. Since then, a Morning Consult poll released on Tuesday showed Harris\u2019s approval rating at 50%, up from 43% a week previously, and a separate poll from Reuters/Ipsos found Ms Harris was supported by 43% of registered voters, and Trump supported by 42%.\nSome Democratic campaigners in Michigan say that her background as a black woman has helped Ms Harris reach some voters.

    "The first four people to be convicted for their part in a violent protest in Sunderland a week ago have been jailed.\nUp to 700 people were involved in a night of violence on 2 August, in which police officers were repeatedly attacked, a building burnt out and businesses looted, Newcastle Crown Court heard.\nA woman who pushed bins at officers and a man who threw missiles were among those jailed for more than two years, while three more men are now awaiting sentencing.\nJudge Paul Sloan KC said they had brought \"shame\" upon Sunderland and were part of an \"orgy of mindless, destructive violence\".\nProsecutor Omar Ahmed said a \"planned protest\" started at about 16:00 BST in Sunderland city centre, but it \"very soon turned into widespread violent disorder\".\nHe said at its peak about 700 people were thought to be involved, with multiple police officers subjected to \"serious and sustained levels of violence\" over the course of several hours.\nFour officers needed hospital treatment, while many others were not yet fit enough to return to frontline duties, Mr Ahmed said.\nHe said the officers' families had to watch in \"fear for their loved ones\" as the attacks were shown on the news and social media.\n\"It was simply not safe for ordinary members of the public to be in the city centre at that time,\" Mr Ahmed said, adding a police office on Waterloo Place was set on fire, businesses were damaged, shops looted and numerous windows smashed.\nOne officer said it was the \"worst and most frightening\" disorder they had experienced in 27 years of service, Mr Ahmed said.\nThe first defendant to be jailed was Andrew Smith, 41, of High Street East in Sunderland, who threw a can of alcohol at officers before being taken down by a police dog at about 19:30.\nIn mitigation, Helen Towers said Smith was \"deeply ashamed of what he did to his own community\" and wanted to apologise to everyone impacted and the police.\nSmith, who had numerous previous convictions including for racially aggravated criminal damage, was jailed for two years and two months.\nJosh Kellett was reported to police by a member of the public who recognised him from a live stream on social media, Mr Ahmed said.\nIn the footage, Kellett, who was wearing a balaclava, repeatedly threw rocks and stones at officers during the \"violent and chaotic scenes\", the prosecutor said.\nIn mitigation, Andrew Espley said Kellett had anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and, like most people in the country, wished \"the clocks could be turned back\" to before the disorder.\nKellet, 29 and of Southcroft in Washington, was jailed for two and a half years after Judge Sloan said footage from the scene showed him \"revelling in the mayhem\".\nLeanne Hodgson, 43 and of Holborn Road in Sunderland, was first seen by officers in Keel Square at about 15:30 where she shouted racist abuse at an officer, Mr Ahmed said.\nLater she barged into an officer and was seen pushing bins at police, as well as pulling up paving stones for other people to throw, the court heard.\nHodgson, who was wearing distinctive bright pink shorts during the melee, also smashed a police car windscreen by throwing an object through it, the court heard.\nShe was jailed for two and a half years.\nBradley Makin filmed himself cheering on attacks on police and buildings and shared it on his Instagram page, the court heard.\nHe was heard shouting slogans associated with the English Defence League and yelled encouragement as items, including metal beer kegs and scaffolding poles, were hurled through windows of an office building and at officers, Mr Ahmed said.\nIn mitigation, Peter Thubron said Makin had gone to the scene out of curiosity and \"and got sucked into it\", adding he \"didn't touch anyone, didn't touch anything, didn't pick anything up\" and did not realise the connotations of what he was chanting.\nMakin, 21 and of Simonside Road in Sunderland, also admitted possession of cocaine and heroin which police found at his home when they went to arrest him and was jailed for two years.\nJudge Sloan said the rioters had \"brought shame upon the city of Sunderland\", telling them: \"For no justifiable reason whatsoever you and many more gathered in the city centre and participated in an orgy of mindless destructive violence and disorder.\"\nIn a statement read to the court, Northumbria Police chief constable Vanessa Jardine said the estimated policing cost of the riots was more than \u00a31m, while the cost of repairing all the damage caused would \"likely be in the hundreds of thousands of pounds\".\nShe said officers suffered fractured fingers and head injuries during \"ferocious\" attacks and the actions of those in Sunderland \"fuelled and encouraged\" other violent mobs around the country.\nMeanwhile, three other men have admitted their parts in the Sunderland disorder at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court.\nDean Groenewald, 32, of no fixed abode, Paul Williams, 45, of Esdale, Sunderland, and Liam Doeg, 33, of Tatham Street, Sunderland, all plea",
    "Drones have been buzzing over Welsh wetlands this year as researchers try to find curlew nests and save the upland wader from extinction.\nThe Eurasian curlew could be gone in Wales as a \"viable breeding species\" by 2033 if a 6% annual decline continues, experts warn.\nThe thermal imagine drones spot heat from nests hidden in deep grass and bogs.\nElectric fencing, as well as fox and crow culls, can then be used to protect the curlew's chicks.\n\"If we don't start doing it now, it's going to be too late,\" said Tony Cross, an ornithology consultant working with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) on a curlew recovery plan.\nIt cites habitat loss, farming practices and predation as the main pressures on an estimated breeding population of between 400 and 1,700 birds, down by up to 90% in the past three decades.\nHe said it would be \"horrifying\" to lose \"that evocative, bubbling call up in the hills\", describing it as a \"symbol of wilderness\". \nMr Cross added technology was helping, including a \"massive advance\" in GPS trackers, which are now small enough to \"strap on the back of a curlew\".\nNRW fitted 15 curlew in Wales with GPS tags in 2022, giving researchers a real-time view of their migration from across Europe to important breeding and wintering areas in Wales.\nThe most recent data shows seven birds returned to Wales this year - six to breed after wintering in Ireland and one that bred in Sweden but wintered on the Dyfi Estuary near Aberystwyth in Ceredigion.\nOne place the Welsh curlews came back to this year was near Fenn's, Whixall & Bettisfield Mosses, a nature reserve straddling the Wales-England border near Wrexham.\nBea Eade helped to set up electric fences in the reserve to try to protect the young from predators.\n\"I saw my first ever curlew yesterday and it was quite special,\" she said.\n\u201cIt would be a shame if future generations didn\u2019t have that,\" the 19-year-old from Telford in Shropshire added, describing the bird's curved beak as \"cute\". \nDaniel Johnson, 22, from Wem in Shropshire, is also volunteering to try and help save the curlew. \n\"It's important for people to know that this beautiful species that is quite iconic in Wales is under threat,\" he said. \n\"I really hope my children and grandchildren will be able to see them.\"\nOne in six of the nearly 4,000 animal, plant and fungi species in Wales face extinction, with the curlew described as the country's \"most pressing bird conservation priority\". \nThe decline of their natural habitat means curlew often breed in farmers' hayfields where their nests can be destroyed if the grass is mown in May or June, before chicks have had time to fledge. \n\"The thing we have to get right in the next decade is integrating curlews with farming,\" Mr Cross said, suggesting a new agricultural subsidy deal that rewards farmers for protecting curlew habitats. \nBut wildlife habitat measures in the Welsh government's Sustainable Farming Scheme were widely criticised by farmers and the scheme has been delayed until 2026.\nFarmers who want to help curlew on their land now face the same problem as researchers - their nests are notoriously difficult to find. \nThe bird has a long history in Welsh folklore. \nSt Beuno, a seventh century abbot, was said to be so grateful to a curlew for rescuing his prayer book after it fell into the sea that he asked for all curlews to be protected. \n\"Now we have the benefit of modern technology to help us identify those nests a little more easily,\" said Bethan Beech, from NRW, adding that their nests give off heat, which is visible to thermal imaging cameras. \nMs Beech is leading curlew recovery projects in 12 locations across Wales, including near Whixall where NRW and Natural England are using drones as part of a nest-finding trial. \nShe said locating breeding sites could help researchers find out where the birds are, as well as \"how many chicks they are likely to be producing\".\nResearchers can also put electric fencing around the nests to keep out predators and pinpoint the best places to reduce fox and crow numbers by culling.\nDrones could one day be used to help farmers find and protect nests on their land, Ms Beech added. \n\"Technology is allowing us to more easily identify where the curlew is on their land and once they know that [farmers] can adjust. \n\"That's usually by agreeing to mow the fields a little later than they may do usually and also create suitable habitats in terms of small wetlands and other important features for curlew throughout the year.\u201d\nMs Beech, who runs a farm herself, said farmers are \"keen to help\". \n\"It\u2019s a species they recognise and it's part of their culture,\" she said. \n\"We've got time [to save the curlew], so now is the time to act so we can ensure that future generations get to hear that fantastic call when the bird arrives back in the uplands in the Spring.\u201d",

More comfortable seating was added in the 1930s.\nHaving stayed open during World War Two, it survived the bombing of Liverpool, but was devastated by fire in the summer of 1958. It reopened three months later.\nIn 2006, the sudden deaths of its chief projectionist and owner saw it closed again.\nLater that year it was used for filming for the 1920s themed BBC drama Lilies.\nIt reopened again in March 2007 and went on to feature in the 2009 John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy.\nIt also hosted the red carpet premiere of Indian blockbuster Madrasapattinam a year later.\nOn 18 March 2020, during the Covid-19 lockdown, it closed and remained shut ever since.\nIn a post on Facebook the cinema said: \"We know you have all been awaiting a further update regarding the progress of Woolton Picture House and we are appreciative of your patience.\"\nAdding they had been \"working behind the scenes on exciting plans\" to make \"a range of enhancements and improvements to our building\".\n\"We plan to create a vibrant, accessible and inclusive space that may be enjoyed for many years to come,\" they said.\nMr Kelly added: \"We need to move forward and now and this is the perfect opportunity and the perfect time.\"\nThe BBC has approached Woolton Picture House for comment. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Five people have died on the streets of Belfast since charity the Welcome Organisation was forced to close its headquarters after an arson attack.\nA car was rammed into the shutters of the Welcome Organisation's Townsend Street centre on 23 July before being set on fire.\nThreatening graffiti was then sprayed on a wall warning workers they would be shot if they repaired the west Belfast building. \nThe charity has now said the centre will be closed \"indefinitely\" due to the danger to staff and service users.\nThe Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) has been blamed for the attack.\nAs the organisation tries to adapt to its new circumstances, the reality for those who are homeless has not changed.\nBBC News NI spent 24 hours with the outreach team at the Welcome Organisation to understand how the charity is coping as demand for homeless services surge.\nOutreach manager Ellie Hippsley works with her team to support the most vulnerable people living on the streets in the city.\nHer job is very complex and the rise in homelessness and drug use has made the role even more difficult.\n\"We are seeing a real increase in homelessness and in drug taking,\" she said.\n\"We have met that increase with the same resources we had available to us 10 years ago.  \n\"We have the same staffing numbers, we have the same finances coming in and we're still responding.\"\nThe change in the types of drugs people are using in Belfast is very obvious.\nCocaine is the drug of choice now due to its availability, and most people are injecting it.  \nThe UK government previously said 84% of those injecting drugs in Northern Ireland were injecting cocaine. \nThat's compared to just over 5% in 2018.\n\"People are injecting 20 to 30 times a day - that's 20 to 30 new holes in your body,\" Ellie said.\n\"People are more confident when they are using cocaine, they're more brazen.\"\nProf Anne Campbell, from the Drug and Alcohol Research Network at Queen's University Belfast, told BBC News NI there are \u201cincreasing concerns\u201d for intravenous drug users with a notable rise in those injecting cocaine.\nOne method of monitoring drug use is through needle exchanges.\n\u201cWe count how many people come in and what type of needle they request and that can often dictate\u2026 we will know what type of substance they will use,\" Prof Campbell said.\n\u201cVery small needles, 0.5 mls, are usually used for cocaine and there\u2019s been a 40% increase in the handing out of those specific needles, to our people who use in services, in the last quarter in comparison with this time last year.\u201d\nVariables within the market, such as a shortage of poppies - used in the production of heroin - due to the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan, has seen the stimulant surge in popularity, she explained.\nPurity of cocaine and the way the drug is sold has also impacted local markets.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday, Jude White, chairperson of the Welcome Organisation said: \"As I was informed last night by one of my senior staff, there has actually been five deaths now since last Tuesday and before the sun goes down tonight there will probably be another death. \n\"The public have a right to know, is the closure of a day centre directly related to these five deaths? One has to be speculative here, the likelihood is yes, but it\u2019s by no means absolutely certain.\"\nThe five people were all known to services - four were homeless.\nHe described the situation has \"the biggest crisis\" the organisation has \"ever faced\". \nWith five people dying on the streets in a week, the outreach team are concerned.\n\"Not all of these were drug-related deaths, one was a blind man with quite complicated health issues,\" Ellie said.\n\"He was released from Maghaberry [prison] with no GP, no medication and a long history of heart attacks.\n\"He died in his tent.\"\nThe issue is complex, and many members of the team stressed that a home would not solve everyone's problems.\nThat is the case for one woman we met sleeping in a shop doorway in the city centre.\nSusan (not her real name) has a tenancy in Belfast, but she chooses to sleep in a sleeping bag in the city centre.\nShe has complex needs and is also dependent on drugs.\n\u201cI know it sounds mad to people but I just can't settle in a house,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s too quiet, I don\u2019t like being alone.\n\u201cI am used to sleeping on the streets, I\u2019ve been doing this for 13 years\u201d.\nAlthough many living on the streets have complex lives with drug and alcohol dependencies, others just need a home.\nAmanda and Ronnie McCracken missed two payments on their rent and were made homeless.\nThey spent three weeks in temporary accommodation, but are now living on the streets after that fell through.\nAt the time of speaking, they were living in CS Lewis Square in east Belfast.\n\"I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, it's a nightmare,\" Ronnie said.  \nThe couple spent two nights in Belfast city centre, but said the experience was \"terrifying\".\n\"The first night we didn't sleep, we sat up on a bench cold and afraid",
    "Two roads in Salisbury are set to be closed whilst improvement work is carried out. \nIt comes as part of Wiltshire Council's \u00a39m investment from the government's Future High Streets Fund (FHSF), which is split between three projects. \nSalisbury Station Forecourt was allocated \u00a35.3m, while Fisherton Gateway was allocated \u00a33.2m. The remaining \u00a3800,000 will be used for Heritage Living, in a project to redevelop a vacant listed building to create apartments.\nWiltshire Council said the projects aim to \"reinvigorate\" the city. \nFisherton Street will be closed between 19:00 and 06:00 BST from 5 to 8 August for improvements which aim to make pedestrian travel into the city centre easier, safer and more convenient. \nThe area will also have new landscaping, widened footpaths and continuous footways at junctions to provide a level crossing and priority for pedestrians. \nThe road will also be closed to traffic for resurfacing work between 12 and 23 August. \nDuring the closure, Central Car Park and The Maltings Car Park will remain open for free parking between 18:00 and 08:00 for all users of Fisherton Street. \nWork began in August 2023, and is expected to finish by the end of this month. \nChurchfields Road will be closed between 20:00 and 05:00 from 8 to 9 August for station forecourt improvements. \nUnder the enhancement plans, pedestrian and cycle access to the station will be created as well as a new crossing point. \nNew landscaping, modern street furniture and more sustainable travel facilities are all planned, according to the council. \nLighting will also be installed, to ensure security. \nWork began in June and is expected to take about a year to complete. \nWiltshire Council apologised in advance for any inconvenience caused by the work and said disturbance will be kept to a minimum. \nCouncillor Nick Holder said: \u201cOne of our Business Plan priorities is to have vibrant well-connected communities and we are well on our way to achieving this in Salisbury.\n\u201cWe would like to thank businesses and residents for their patience and continued co-operation in delivering these important schemes for Salisbury.\u201d\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Warning: This article contains details which some readers may find upsetting\nIsrael\u2019s leading human rights organisation says conditions inside Israeli prisons holding Palestinian detainees amount to torture.\nB\u2019tselem\u2019s report entitled \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d, contains testimony from 55 recently released Palestinian detainees, whose graphic testimony points to a dramatic worsening of conditions inside prisons since the start of the Gaza war 10 months ago.\nIt's the latest in a series of reports, including one last week by the UN, which contain shocking allegations of abuse directed against Palestinian prisoners.\nB\u2019tselem says the testimony their researchers have gathered is remarkably consistent.\n\u201cAll of them again and again, told us the same thing,\u201d says Yuli Novak, B\u2019tselem\u2019s executive director.\n\u201cOngoing abuse, daily violence, physical violence and mental violence, humiliation, sleep deprivation, people are starved.\u201d\nMs Novak\u2019s conclusion is stark.\n\u201cThe Israeli prison system as a whole, in regard to Palestinians, turned into a network of torture camps.\u201d\nSince the deadly Hamas attacks of 7 October, in which around 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, the number of Palestinian detainees has doubled to around 10,000.\nIsrael\u2019s prisons - some run by the army, others by the country\u2019s prison service - have become overwhelmed.\nJails are overflowing, with a dozen or more inmates sometimes sharing cells designed to accommodate no more than six.\nB\u2019tselem\u2019s report describes overcrowded, filthy cells, where some inmates are forced to sleep on the floor, sometimes without mattresses or blankets.\nSome prisoners were captured in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks. Others were rounded up in Gaza as Israel\u2019s invasion got under way, or were arrested in Israel or the occupied West Bank.\nMany were later released without charge.\nFiras Hassan was already in jail in October, held under \u201cadministrative detention\u201d, a measure by which suspects \u2013 though it has overwhelmingly been applied to Palestinians - can be detained, more or less indefinitely, without charge.\nIsrael says that its use of the policy is necessary, and compliant with international law.\nFiras says he saw with his own eyes how conditions quickly deteriorated after 7 October.\n\u201cLife totally changed,\u201d he told me when we met in Tuqu\u2019, a West Bank village south of Bethlehem.\n\u201cI call what happened a tsunami.\u201d\nMr Hassan has been in and out of jail since the early nineties, twice charged with membership of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel and much of the West.\nHe makes no secret of his past affiliation, saying he was \u201cactive\u201d.\nFamiliar with the rigours of life in prison, he said nothing prepared him for what happened when officers entered his cell two days after 7 October.\n\u201cWe were severely beaten by 20 officers, masked men using batons and sticks, dogs and firearms,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe were tied from behind, our eyes blindfolded, beaten severely. Blood was gushing from my face. They kept beating us for 50 minutes. I saw them from under the blindfold. They were filming us while beating us.\u201d\nMr Hassan was eventually released, without charge, in April, by which time he said he had lost 3 stone (20kg).\nA video filmed on the day of his release shows a gaunt figure.\n\u201cI spent 13 years in prison in the past,\u201d he told B\u2019tselem researchers later that month, \u201cand never experienced anything like that.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not just Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank who talk about the abuse in Israeli prisons.\nIsraeli citizens, like Sari Khourieh, an Israeli Arab lawyer from Haifa, say it has also happened to them.\nMr Khourieh was held at the Megiddo prison in northern Israel for 10 days last November. The police said that two of his Facebook posts had glorified the actions of Hamas \u2013 a charge quickly dismissed.\nBut his brief experience of prison \u2013 his first \u2013 nearly broke him.\n\u201cThey just lost their mind,\u201d he says of the scenes he witnessed at Megiddo.\n\u201cThere was no law. There was no order inside.\u201d\nMr Khourieh says he was spared the worst of the abuse. But he says he was stunned by the treatment of his fellow inmates.\n\u201cThey were hitting them badly for no reason,\u201d he told us. \u201cThey were screaming, the guys, \u2018we didn't do nothing. You don't have to hit us.\u2019\u201d\nSpeaking to other detainees, he quickly learned that what he was seeing was not normal.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best treatment before 7 October, they told me, but afterwards everything was different.\u201d\nDuring a brief spell in an area of isolation cells known by the prisoners as Tora Bora (a reference to al-Qaeda\u2019s network of caves in Afghanistan), Mr Khourieh says he heard a beaten inmate pleading for medical help in an adjacent cell.\nAccording to Mr Khourieh, doctors tried to revive him, but he died shortly afterwards.\nAccording to last week\u2019s UN report, \u201cannouncements by IPS (Israel Prison Service) and prisoners organisations indicate that 17 Palestinians have died in the custody o",

In their second innings the British players declared on 145 for five, bowling the French out for 26 to win the match by 158 runs.\nAt the time the visiting players were given a silver medal and the hosts a bronze, with these converted to gold and silver 12 years later.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "A boss of a scrap metal yard that was ravaged by a fire has said the cause of the fire was \"totally expected\".\nSackers scrap metal recycling yard at Great Blakenham near Ipswich was engulfed by a major fire on Thursday.\nSuffolk Fire and Rescue Fire Service concluded the blaze was caused by a discarded battery.\nDavid Dodds, chief executive at Sackers, said more education was needed about the proper way to discard of batteries. \n\"They are the scourge of the recycling industry,\" he explained to BBC Radio Suffolk.\n\"We process 125,000 tonnes a year - a battery that can cause damage like it did weighs 500g.\n\"It is really difficult to look at every piece of metal that comes through our yard at that volume.\"\nMr Dodds added that there needed to be more public awareness around lithium-ion batteries that cannot be discarded in normal waste. \nThe National Fire Chiefs Council said in May that lithium-ion batteries thrown in household rubbish bins had led to more than 1,200 fires in the UK waste system in the past 12 months, compared to 700 in 2022.\n\"It's all down to the general public not educated enough in the danger that these lithium-ion batteries can cause,\" Mr Dodds continued.\n\"There isn't enough recycling centres that can take all these batteries.\"\nFollowing the fire, which saw 80 firefighters attend, nearby residents expressed concerns.\nLast year saw two other fires happen at the site. \nMr Dodds explained the company had \"invested a lot of money\" in its safety procedures.\n\"There will be further investment into firefighting equipment that we have on our site,\" he said.\n\"[A fire] is the last thing we want on our site.\n\"We are a production-based business, we want to be producing. \n\"We do not want these fires, we do not want lithium-ion batteries on our site full stop.\n\"We want to be good neighbours.\"\nMr Dodds said the company would \"continue to improve\" and was investing in more fire safety equipment including thermal imaging fire retention equipment. \n\"It's a serious amount of money but we're a serious business and we intend to do the job properly,\" he added.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "When Jean Frickel fell ill, her family called an ambulance so she could get the crucial life-extending help she needed. \nBut she died before it arrived. She had waited for 13 hours. \nThe head of Wales' ambulance service said the number of hours lost while crews waited to hand over patients had quadrupled since 2018. \nOne patient in Wales waited 46 hours and 46 minutes - almost two days - for an ambulance after a fall.\nJean's case is one of 39 across England and Wales over the past two years where coroners have called for changes to the system to prevent these avoidable deaths. \nThe Welsh government said it had invested more than \u00a3180m in improving patient flow and managing people safely in the community.\nA coroner ruled Jean's 13-hour wait was because ambulances were queuing to offload patients and unable to answer 999 calls. \nJean's daughter, Helen Underhill, 62, said: \"It\u2019s unforgiveable that an ambulance should be waiting outside hospital for someone to be seen, when somebody else is sitting at home, like my mum, in need.\n\"It\u2019s not the doctors, it\u2019s not the nurses, it\u2019s not the paramedics. It\u2019s getting the ambulances back on the road.\"\nShe explained her mum, a former retail worker from Buckley, Flintshire, had suffered increasingly poor health after a heart attack at the age of 52, but it prompted her to live life to the full for the next 20 years.\n\"I knew that the time my mum had was limited,\" said Ms Underhill, who lives in Stourport-on-Severn, West Midlands.\n\"So you grasp at every hour and keep them for as long as you can.\"\nOn the night that Jean died, the Welsh Ambulance Service was in the middle of its busiest period to date, but the issue is felt across Wales, as well as England. \n\"It just leaves you feeling, what is going to happen if I get ill?\" said Helen. \"If I need somebody to be there instantly, I dread it.\"\nIn analysis of prevention of future death reports issued by coroners, BBC Wales found one coroner in north Wales said he had raised these issues in March 2013 and the problem had become \"significantly worse rather than better\" in the past 10 years. \nOf the 39 reports issued since 2022 the longest wait in Wales was 34 hours, which included a wait for the ambulance to arrive and an additional wait outside hospital.\nIn England this was 16 hours.\nJason Killens, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Services University NHS Trust, said avoidable harm was happening \"every day\" because of pressure on the system. \nHe said it had left him feeling \"deeply frustrated, concerned and sad\". \n\"In 2018 when I joined the services here in Wales, we were losing about 6,000 hours a month to delays in handing over to emergency departments,\" he said. \n\"Now, in June just gone, that\u2019s just over 22,000 \u2013 10% up on last year, and four times what we were seeing six years ago. It\u2019s a significant problem for us.\"\nHe said even the 400-plus additional staff, funded by Welsh government, were not enough to meet the growing demand.\n\"The answer is not hundreds more paramedics and hundreds more ambulances, because what we will do is continue to convey patients to emergency departments to join queues, which will get bigger.\"\nHe said clinical advisers had been added to the contact centres, to give advice and triage calls, as well as advanced paramedic practitioners to treat more patients at home.\n\"We\u2019re seeing examples across Wales where there is a recognition of the risk which we\u2019re carrying on behalf of the system \u2013 but these are NHS patients, not ambulance service patients.\"\nThe Welsh government said while handovers were the responsibility of health boards,  more than \u00a3180m in additional funds had been invested this year, . \nIt said this was \"to help safely manage more people in the community, avoid ambulance transport and admission to hospital, and work with social care services to improve patient flow through hospitals\".\nMonthly performance data in June showed nearly 21,900 hours were \"lost\" to handover delays by ambulances waiting more than 15 minutes outside major A&Es in Wales. \nA freedom of information request said more than 2,000 ambulances waited more than four hours outside major A&E units in May alone. \nWhile 45% of Welsh ambulances are taking an hour or more to hand over a patient at major emergency unit, compared with 10% in England.\nLucille Strachan, 79 and her husband Dave had been married 52 years when he died in March 2022, at the age of 76, of a heart attack.\nThe retired engineer woke just after 23:00 with chest pains and difficulty breathing, but Lucille was told it would be a four hour wait for an ambulance to their home in Llangollen, Denbighshire. \n\"We just waited and waited,\" said Lucille. \"I didn\u2019t realise he was dying \u2013 that was the hardest thing.\"\nLucille and Dave waited nine hours and 52 minutes, but she was told by a consultant at his inquest that if they'd had a response within 120 minutes \"he\u2019d probably be alive today\".\nAn ambulance even arrived on their driveway, but was diverted away to a mor",

    "A group of runners have worked hard to restore an eight-lane athletics track that had been in a state of disrepair for 30 years.  \nThe 400m \"cinder\" circuit on the Temple Newsam estate was once Leeds' main athletics facility, and the first in the city to be available for public use when it opened in 1954.\nIt hosted prestigious meets, but local running clubs believe it has not been regularly maintained since the 1990s.\nAfter being told that Leeds City Council could not fund rejuvenation work, volunteers from Crossgates Harriers decided to uncover the track themselves.\nThey have spent months improving the track, which was described as being in \"terrible\" condition, alongside runners from St Theresa's Athletic Club.\nVolunteer Sarah Marquis-Linley said: \"If, as a community, we didn't come together, everyone else would assume someone else is doing something, when in reality they're not.\"\nCrossgates Harriers member Graham Wilson said that with \"cuts here and cuts there\", public funding was \"just not available\" for the project. \n\"Sometimes if you want something doing and you want to use it yourself, then you've got to muck in and get the job done,\" he added. \nRunner Andy Darby added that the Temple Newsam track was one of the last of its kind in Leeds that was still publicly accessible. \n\"That's why we want to support it and rebuild it,\" he said.\n\"It's really popular, loads of communities groups come out, it's fabulous.\"\nThe area in the middle of the track used to be a football pitch and tennis court.

    "A Muslim woman living in Northern Ireland says nowhere feels safe for many families after recent racist attacks.\nJane, not her real name, says rising Islamophobia means parents are afraid to bring their children to play parks during the summer holidays.\nSimilar fears have been expressed by a Nigeria-born community worker in Belfast, Israel Eguaogie.\nHe said a summer scheme in the city had to be cancelled for security reasons.\nThere have been a series of racially-motivated attacks and violent disorder since Saturday, following an anti-immigration protest in Belfast.\nJane, who wears a hijab, told BBC News NI nowhere felt safe any more.\n\u201cThe prominent narrative has been against Muslims but it\u2019s also people who are visibly different,\" she said.\n\u201cVisible minorities - whether that\u2019s black families, Asian families, anyone with a different skin colour, different accent - I think are thinking twice today about where they\u2019re going to take their children \u2026 even to the park.\n\u201cEven in the small regional towns that we haven\u2019t heard so much about there\u2019s been added graffiti, there\u2019s been things said, there\u2019s been maybe comments made that have just made people a little concerned \u2026 is there anywhere safe in Northern Ireland?\"\nJane said some families were considering moving to Scotland, Wales or parts of England where there has not been unrest in recent days.\nShe said there had been an escalation in racism in Northern Ireland in recent months, not just the past week.\nAt the same time, she said she had been encouraged by offers of support.\n\"Don\u2019t underestimate the small gestures, the people who have sent messages just saying: \u2018I hope you\u2019re safe, I hope your family are safe', offering to go to the shops with someone if they don\u2019t feel safe,\" she said.\n\u201cThose neighbourly, beautiful moments. \n\"They mean a lot in a period like now.\u201d\nMr Eguaogie is involved with a number of organisations including Belfast City of Sanctuary and Diverse Youth NI, and has been in Northern Ireland for 14 years.\nHe said the recent trouble had been \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d and \u201cshocking\u201d.\n\u201cIt has put everybody including myself in a state of fear and panic where people do not know what else to do,\u201d he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra.\n\u201cYou have lived in a community for quite a long time that has been very peaceful and welcoming and all of a sudden your door is smashed in, that\u2019s shocking.\u201d\nHe said a number of activities planned for young people from ethnic minorities had had to be cancelled.\n\u201cWe have had to reassure parents, please keep your children at home and Muslim women should stay at home because they are a target because of the hijab,\u201d he added.\nOn Wednesday, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister said people involved in recent disorder in Northern Ireland were \"causing destruction to their own communities\".\nThe Democratic Unionist Party Emma Little-Pengelly told reporters at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine that nothing was achieved by violence.\n\nPolice have made a number of arrests since the weekend.\nThere has been widespread disorder across the UK - which erupted after the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport - with unrest fuelled by misinformation online.",
    "The fast-food giants are falling over themselves in an increasingly competitive race to offer you the best deal.\nWhether that\u2019s low-price breakfasts at McDonald\u2019s or at bakery chain Greggs, or lunch offers from KFC and Domino\u2019s, promotions are surging in popularity.\nSo why the sudden splurge in special offers? \nPut simply, customers are being more thrifty and the chains want to tempt you back, though critics worry about the health impacts of this buffet of fast-food deals.\nThe number of promotions on offer at fast-food restaurants, bakeries and coffee shops between April and June this year jumped by a third from the same period last year.\nThis is according to data from Meaningful Vision, which tracks the sector. \n\u201cThe use of promotions is growing as a key tool to generate additional traffic, which has not been growing,\u201d says chief executive Maria Vanifatova.\nFootfall was in decline over the year to May, and only now is 1% up on a year ago, she says.\nFast-food operators, like other businesses, put their prices up sharply during the cost-of-living crisis.\nBut prices in fast food on average increased slightly more than prices in grocery chains, points out Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert at consulting firm Roland Berger, who used to be an executive at KFC.\n\u201cThis unprecedented speed of change has not really given businesses or consumers time to get used to the new price levels,\" she says.\nThis is making customers either trade down to cheaper menu items or eat at home instead, Ms Gehin adds. \nAs such, fast-food companies are \"using the promotion lever to try to stimulate demand\".\nLet\u2019s not forget that firms have a bottom line to think about. \nMcDonald\u2019s saw its first fall in sales since the pandemic in the second quarter of this year, forcing the company into a \"comprehensive rethink\" of pricing.\n\u201cIt used to be quite good value, but is now seen as quite expensive,\u201d says independent retail expert Clare Bailey, whose first job was working in a McDonald\u2019s.\nShe says you can have a sit-down plated meal in a pub for not much more than a meal deal from a fast-food chain.\nBut there are reasons the sector has had to put prices up, she says.\nHigh energy costs, packaging costs, the increase in the minimum wage for staff, and in McDonald\u2019s case, the commitment to locally source its beef, have all played a part.\nAlistair Macrow, chief executive of McDonald's UK and Ireland, says people face difficult decisions about where and when they spend their money and that value is \"more important than ever\".\nHe says the firm listens to customer feedback when it comes to considering what offers to run.\n\u201cOur 3 for \u00a33 Deal first ran at the end of the month, when our customers tell us they need help most, and across school half-terms, allowing more families to come together for a meal out. \n\"We heard it worked, so we have just brought it back to coincide with school summer holidays.\"\nHe adds that McDonald's introduced a breakfast deal in the spring - which brought it into direct competition with Greggs - because \"customers told us they need to prioritise value at breakfast\". \nThat deal has also been brought back for a limited period.\nMaria Vanifatova says lunches have become particularly competitive.\nFor example, KFC launched a \u00a35.49 lunch deal in March, which gets you a fried chicken wrap, side and drink.\nA month later, Domino\u2019s revealed its lunchtime \u00a34 Cheeky Little Pizza, and Pizza Hut and TGI Friday\u2019s have also recently joined the mix.\nHowever, while these chains say they are seeking to offer value for money to their customers, Katherine Jenner, director of the Obesity Health Alliance, is cynical and worries about the health impact.\n\u201cMulti-buy offers are not designed to save people money - companies are not doing them to be nice,\" she says.\n\"They are a marketing tactic designed to get people to buy things they weren't otherwise going to.\"\nMs Jenner says the portion sizes in fast-food places are much larger than you would make at home. There is also more sugar, salt and fat, she says.\n\"You can't even make informed decisions about what you\u2019re buying as the information isn\u2019t easily available.\u201d\nSo how long can we expect this proliferation of promotions to last?\n\u201cOnce consumers come to expect discounts and vouchers and so on, it\u2019s hard to take it away because a lot of shoppers will come to rely on it,\" says Ms Bailey.\n\"They may never have gone there for full price.\"\nSiobhan Gehin isn\u2019t so sure, though.\n\u201cI would expect discounting to continue for at least the rest of this year, but to gradually ease off as consumer sentiment continues to improve and as interest rates ease.\u201d\nBut one trend that looks like it is here to stay is that of offering deals via apps.\nMcDonald\u2019s Mondays and Burger King\u2019s Whopper Wednesdays are both examples of app-based promotions. KFC and Subway also offer new deals every few weeks for their app customers.\n\u201cMore and more companies are approaching their loyal clients and offering them deals to keep them loyal,\u201d says Me",
    "Millions around the world paused to recall the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings on 6 June.\nPoliticians and the few remaining veterans gathered in France to pay tribute to those who fought and died on the Normandy beaches during World War II.\nNo international celebrations will be staged this week to mark the 80th anniversary of the death of the 23-year-old son of a rag-and-bone man who was born in Camberwell, south London, and fought with the Royal Norfolk Regiment.\nBut the name of Sidney Bates VC, a real-life comic-strip hero who made the ultimate sacrifice in a bid to protect his comrades, lives on.\nCpl Bates, who was known as \"Basher\", was a member of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Norfolk Regiment and landed in Normandy, on Sword Beach, on D-Day.\nHe survived the initial onslaught, but there was a battle beyond D-Day, and Cpl Bates, who turned 23 on 14 June 1944, had only weeks to live.\nHe was wounded on 6 August 1944 when he staged a lone charge near the village of Sourdeval, dying two days later.\nHe was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross (VC) in late 1944, and 20 years later became the star of one of Britain's most popular comics.\nThe Victor, printed and published by D.C. Thomson & Co and John Leng & Co, told  of Cpl Bates' heroism in a front- and back-page illustrated story headed, \"The Charge of Basher Bates\", on 22 February 1964.\nIt explained how Cpl Bates was in command of a section of the Norfolk Regiment as British troops tried to break out of the \"Falaise pocket\".\nCpl Bates charged the enemy after his friend was killed, said the strip.\nCpl Bates has not been forgotten in Camberwell\nSouthwark Council's archivists have paid tribute in an online blog.\nIt tells how Cpl Bates was born on 14 June 1921, in Crown Street, Camberwell.\nHe worked as a carpenter's labourer after leaving school at 14 and joined the Army  in 1940, entering the 1st Battalion Royal Norfolk Regiment.\n\"On 6 August 1944, the 1st Norfolks were relieving the 3rd Monmouthshire Regiment near the village of Sourdeval,\" says the blog.\n\"They were attacked in force by the 10th SS Panzer Division.\"\nThe blog adds: \"Eventually, Sidney\u2019s section came under attack by 50 to 60 Germans armed with machine guns and mortars and supported by panzers. \n\"(Jonathan) Tojo Tomlin, Sidney\u2019s close friend, was the section\u2019s Bren gunner. \n\"He died in Sidney\u2019s arms, hit in the face by machine-gun fire.\n\"That\u2019s when Sidney acted.\"\nThe blog went on: \"He picked up Tojo\u2019s Bren gun, got up, and advanced into the hail of bullets and mortars, firing from the hip. \n\"He was struck by machine gun fire and fell to the ground.\n\"He got up, and continued advancing and firing. He was hit, and got up again, twice more.\n\"The fourth time, Sidney was hit by mortar shrapnel. \n\"This time, he couldn\u2019t get up. \n\"Instead, he wrapped himself around his gun, firing at the enemy for as long as his strength held out.\n\"But that was long enough. \n\"The Germans \u2013 perhaps shaken by Sidney\u2019s determination \u2013 retreated to the sound of his gunfire, leaving the position in the hands of the British.\"\nThe blog said Cpl Bates' grave was plot XX 14E in the Bayeux War Cemetery.\nHe is also remembered on a memorial bench on Camberwell Green.\nCouncil archivist Patricia Dark said she would lay flowers at the site of the bench this week.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The daughter of a man believed to be affected by the infected blood scandal said the discovery of his medical records was the \"greatest gift anyone could have given us\". \nCheyenne Usher was 16 when her father, Gavin Usher, 48, died from liver disease in 2013. \nHe contracted hepatitis C after he received a blood transfusion in 1984, however, Ms Usher and her brother Queste had struggled to get the paperwork to prove their father had received contaminated blood. \nThe Hepatitis C Trust said eight out of 10 people affected by the infected blood scandal could have difficulty proving  a case for compensation due to medical records not being kept. \nContaminated blood has led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people -  30,000 were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being given blood and blood products in the 1970s and 1980s.\nMr Usher from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, had received a transfusion at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage after suffering serious injuries in an assault. \nAt first his family thought his medical records had been lost, but after the hospital was contacted by the BBC, the trust that runs it said his records had been located in storage and were \"still available\". \nJustin Daniels, medical director of the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, said: \"Whilst it is standard practice to destroy adult medical records eight years after a patient's last treatment, in April 2019 the Infected Blood Inquiry requested that trusts do not destroy the medical records of relevant patients who have died.\n\"Mr Usher\u2019s medical records are still available, and we encourage the family to get in touch.

    "Thousands of people gathered in Old Market in Bristol to counter a rumoured anti-immigration rally. \nPeople began assembling in the late afternoon and by 19.00 BST the road was closed by huge crowds holding up anti-racism placards and chanting.\nHundreds of police officers were deployed in the city and Avon and Somerset Police said it had been given enhanced stop and search powers under Section 60 and Section 60AA of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. \nThe powers will last until 07:00 BST on Thursday, the force said. \nA Section 34 dispersal zone is also in place, granting officers the power to move groups or individuals causing - or who they believe are likely to cause - harrassment, alarm or distress to others.\nThe rally was prompted over claims on social media that protestors were planning to target an immigration lawyer's business premises. \nMany businesses closed and sent staff home early as a precaution, following on from the \"violent\" scenes of disorder seen in the city on Saturday. \nMany premises along Old Market were also boarded up earlier in the day.\nAvon and Somerset Police officers were supported by specialist resources from mounted, dog and drone units, as well as officers from other forces.\nOfficers are also working 12-hour shifts to \"help keep the city safe\", the force said.\nMany counter-protestors in Old Market carried placards showing their support for the city's diverse community. \nThey also chanted \"refugees are welcome here\". \nHabib, who is originally from Gambia but now lives in the city, said he saw \"unity\" on Wednesday evening.\n\"Like the old saying says - divide and we fall, together we stand.

    "The number of unlawful crossings by migrants at the US southern border has dropped for the fifth consecutive month, according to official data.\nUS Border Patrol agents apprehended around 57,000 migrants along the border in July - the lowest recorded since September 2020. \nThe numbers are down significantly from December, when around 250,000 migrants were caught crossing the border.\nPresident Joe Biden's administration has credited the decrease to recent actions by him to tackle illegal immigration into the US, an election-year political vulnerability for the Democrats.\n\"This is the product of a number of actions this administration has taken,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in an interview with CBS this week.\nMr Mayorkas said those actions include an executive order signed last month by President Joe Biden that allows US immigration officials to deport migrants without processing their asylum claims.\nThe measure has been called one of the most restrictive border policies by a Democratic president in recent times, and was criticised by left-wing members of the party.\nAt the time, the president vowed that his executive order would \"help us gain control of our border\". He added that \"doing nothing is not an option\".\nGovernment data shows that the number of migrants stopped at the US-Mexico border had dropped even before the order.\nBorder Patrol recorded 141,000 apprehensions in February, 137,000 in March, 129,000 in April, 118,000 in May and 84,000 in June.\nThe figures do not include official border crossings, where the Biden administration has been processing around 1,500 migrants each day through a smartphone app that schedules appointments between migrants and US border agents.\nOn the other side of the border, Mexican officials have also been working to curb illegal migration, including stopping people before they attempt to cross on to US soil.\nThe southern border has been a political headache for the Biden administration heading into November\u2019s election.\nMr Biden has been repeatedly criticised by Republicans and their party\u2019s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who said last month that the president had \u201csurrendered our southern border.\u201d\nThe president hit back, accusing the Trump camp of an \"extremely cynical political move\" by pressing Republican politicians to block a proposed border plan in Congress earlier this year.",
    "The dramatic resignation of Bangladesh\u2019s long-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her flight to India ironically underscore the close ties between the two countries.\nMs Hasina ruled Bangladesh, a nation of 170 million, for close to 15 years until a protest by students to abolish civil service quotas snowballed into a broader and violent anti-government movement. At least 280 people have died in clashes between police and anti-government protesters so far.\nBack in June, Ms Hasina visited India twice in two weeks.\nHer first visit was to attend Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's oath-taking ceremony. After that, she made a two-day state visit, the first by a head of government to India after Mr Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition's third consecutive victory in parliamentary elections.\n\"We have met 10 times in the last one year. However, this meeting is special because Sheikh Hasina is the first state guest after the third term of our government,\u201d Mr Modi said at a joint news conference.\nThe bonhomie was unmistakable. \u201cBangladesh greatly values its relations with India,\u201d said Ms Hasina. \u201cCome to Bangladesh to witness what all we have done and plan to do\u201d.\nIndia has a special relationship with Bangladesh. The neighbours share a 4,096km (2,545 miles)-border and linguistic, economic and cultural ties. Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, was born after a war in 1971 with West Pakistan (now Pakistan), with India supporting Bengali nationalists. Bilateral trade between the two countries is around $16bn (\u00a312bn), with India being Bangladesh\u2019s top export destination in Asia.\nTo be sure, the ties are not perfect: differences arise over Bangladesh\u2019s close relationship with China, border security, migration issues and some Bangladeshi officials' discomfort with Mr Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist politics.\nAfter Ms Hasina's resignation, Bangladesh's army chief Waker-uz-Zaman has announced plans for an interim government. He will meet President Mohammed Shahabuddin and reports say he's hoping for a solution by the day's end after speaking with opposition parties, led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Leadership of the interim government remains unclear.\nSo far, India has only described the violent protests as an \"internal matter\" of Bangladesh. Can it say - and do - more about the unfolding developments? \n\"NOTHING. Nothing for now,\" wrote Happymon Jacob, an Indian foreign policy expert, on X (formerly Twitter) on what India should be doing. \n\"It is still unfolding. And, it's not about India; it's about politics in Bangladesh. Let them figure it out.\"\nMichael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, believes Ms Hasina's resignation and flight are \"close to a worst-case scenario for India, as it has long viewed any alternative to Ms Hasina and her party as a threat to Indian interests\".\nMr Kugelman told the BBC that Delhi will likely reach out to Bangladesh's military to convey its concerns and hope its interests are taken into account in an interim government.\n\"Beyond that, India will have to watch and wait nervously. It may support free and fair elections in the interest of stability, but it doesn\u2019t want the BNP - even if it has grown weak and divided - to return. Delhi likely wouldn\u2019t oppose a long period of interim rule for that reason.\"\nMs Hasina's sudden downfall would have caught her allies off guard.\nThe daughter of Bangladesh's founding president and the world\u2019s longest-serving female head of government, Ms Hasina led her country for nearly 15 years. She had overseen one of the world's fastest-growing economies and a major boost in living standards in South Asia.\nBut her rule had also been marked by accusations of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings and repression of the opposition. She and her party Awami League denied these charges, while her government blamed opposition parties for fuelling protests.\nIn January, Ms Hasina won her fourth consecutive term in a controversial election. The opposition BNP boycotted the vote, and allegations of a rigged poll were compounded by mass arrests of its leaders and supporters.\nSome of the anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh stems from India's support for Ms Hasina's government, which critics view as interference in domestic politics. Historical grievances and accusations of overreach also contribute to some of the negative perception. \nAli Riaz, a Bangladeshi-American political scientist at Illinois State University, told the BBC that India's silence is \u201cnot surprising as it has been the principal backer of the Hasina government for the past 14 years and practically contributed to the erosion of democracy in Bangladesh\".\n\u201cThe unqualified support to Sheikh Hasina has acted as a bulwark against any pressure on her for human rights transgressions.

The then SNP minister also highlighted senior positions in the health sector and the trade union movement.\n\"That is a collective failure that includes every single one of us,\" he told MSPs. \"I hope that we are sitting uncomfortably, because those should be uncomfortable truths for us all.\"\nAn edited version of the lengthy speech was widely shared by right-wing accounts on social media.\nBy October 2023, it had reached the attention of Mr Musk on X, which he had rebranded from Twitter three months earlier.\nHe called Mr Yousaf - who had become the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party - a \"blatant racist\". \nA fact check by the Reuters news agency concluded that the clip misrepresented Mr Yousaf's comments by suggesting he had been arguing that Scotland contained too many white people \u2013 when he had been complaining about racial injustice and a lack of people of colour in positions of power.\nShortly afterwards, Mr Yousaf posted: \"Racists foaming at the mouth at my very existence.\"\nHe then added: \"Me:\" and shared a gif from the BBC comedy Still Game, featuring the character Navid dancing in his shop.\nThe then first minister's spokesperson said Mr Yousaf had suffered racist abuse his whole life, adding: \"Mr Musk should use his position to tackle racism and hatred that goes unchecked on the social media platform he owns.\"\nTensions between the pair flared again following days of far-right violence in cities in England and Northern Ireland in recent weeks. \nMr Musk was highly critical of the UK authorities and the way the disorder has been handled.\nHe suggested that \"civil war is inevitable\" and promoted a conspiracy theory that far-right agitators were treated more harshly than minority groups. \nA spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was \"no justification\" for the comments. \nMr Musk and other social media owners have been urged by regulator Ofcom to protect users from content likely to incite violence or hatred.\nMr Yousaf was asked about the tech businessman's intervention during an LBC event at the Edinburgh Festival last Thursday. \nHe branded the X owner \u201cone of the most dangerous men on the planet\u201d, adding: \u201cHe is not accountable to anybody, he has vast wealth at his fingertips and disposal and he uses it for some of the most wicked evil I have seen.\"\nMr Yousaf accused Mr Musk of using his wealth to amplify the far right and white supremacists.\nAfter the ex-SNP leader made similar comments to CNN, Mr Musk described him as \"super, super racist\".\nHe posted on X: \"Scotland gave him everything and yet he loathes white people.\u201d\nThe row escalated further when it was reported Mr Yousaf could take legal action. \nHis lawyer, Aamer Anwar, told the Sunday Mail that Mr Musk had \u201ceffectively painted a target on Humza Yousaf\u2019s back with his completely unacceptable, untrue and inflammatory comments\u201d.\nMeanwhile, Mr Yousaf posted on X: \u201cElon Musk is a dangerous race baiter who must be held to account for his actions.\n\u201cI can't think what it is that upsets him so much about a Brown, Muslim, progressive politician? But his billions won't stop me calling out his support for the far-right.\u201d\nThe tech entrepreneur responded by claiming Mr Yousaf was \"obviously super racist against white people\".\n\"I dare that scumbag to sue me,\" he posted. \"Go ahead, make my day\u2026\u201d\nMr Musk added: \u201cLegal discovery will show that however big a racist he\u2019s been in public communications, he is vastly worse in private communications.\u201d\nHe did not elaborate on what that comment referred t",

    "Businesses in Pontypridd had seen a \u201cslow start\u201d when the National Eisteddfod began in the town last weekend, but \u201cthings have built every day since then\u201d, said a shop owner in the indoor market.\n\u201cInitially people were bypassing the town, and going straight to the maes [field site], but things have really improved in the last few days,\u201d said Angela Robinson, who runs Hulaballoo, a vintage clothing store.\nBusiness owners also said they hoped the event would create a \u201clegacy\u201d and help the town recover from devastating floods brought about by Storm Dennis in 2020 that saw a number of businesses close. \nThis year\u2019s main event is being held in Pontypridd\u2019s Ynysangharad Park, with other \u201cfringe\u201d events taking place throughout the town.\nPontypridd, in Rhondda Cynon Taf, last hosted the Welsh cultural event in 1893, narrowly defeating the US city of Chicago, which had been considered as a location to increase Wales\u2019 international profile.\nAn estimated 3,000 Welsh people lived in and around Chicago at the time, mainly working in the farming and mining industries of the American Midwest.\nAhead of this year\u2019s event, there was initially scepticism from some about Pontypridd hosting the event, but Angela, speaking to the BBC alongside her husband Greg, said this had largely been a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d and down to a lack of communication about the benefits the event could bring to the town.\n\u201cI think this is one of the first eisteddfods that\u2019s actually been held in the middle of a town, and there are some lessons to have been learned there, that they can utilise the town as well, and not just send people straight to the maes,\u201d said Greg.\nHe said organisers and local people had made an effort to advertise the town to visitors, which has had a \u201cmassive impact\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s now been really embraced in the town,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe weather has really helped - until today,\u201d Angela added, laughing, as rain hammered on the market roof during a washout on Thursday.\nShe also said she hoped the event would bring longer term benefits to Pontypridd, which \u201creally suffered\u201d after the 2020 floods.\n\u201cAs business owners, we hope the eisteddfod will leave behind a bit of a legacy, so that people come here and enjoy it, but also come back to visit us afterwards,\u201d said Angela.\n\u201cWe love our town and we want to show it off \u2013 the eisteddfod has given us the chance to do that,\u201d she said.\nKeith Woods has spent several decades as the manager of Pontypridd Market, which has been under private ownership since the 1870s.\nHe said the market has seen a \u201cmassive change\u201d over the years, and was a source of pride for Pontypridd residents.\nHe added that there had been a \u201cbig surge in business\u201d during the eisteddfod, particularly for restaurants and cafes.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just about this week. We hope it\u2019ll create a legacy about the town and encourage people to come back,\u201d he said.\nAs well as the main festival \u2013 which includes talks, live music and performances \u2013 there are also other \u201cfringe\u201d events taking place in Pontypridd, including one near Martha\u2019s Homestore, a retail store run by Jayne Coleman.\nShe said local businesses had benefited from a map \u2013 \u201ca work of art really\u201d - created by local artist Becky Davies that showcases independent businesses in the town.\n\u201cYesterday was my second busiest day ever,\u201d she told the BBC on Thursday. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic \u2013 everyone has said they have loved having the maes, but also the town nearby.\u201d\nA key aim of the eisteddfod is to encourage the growth of the Welsh language, and organisers hope it will contribute to increased use of Welsh in and around Pontypridd, an area that would not be considered a heartland for the language.\nWalking around Pontypridd this week, the BBC overheard a number of conversations of people asking those they were with to teach them a few words in Welsh.\n\u201cSee, you\u2019re basically fluent now,\u201d joked one woman to an older relative after teaching them a few words as they walked away from the festival site.\nKathy Jones, a Welsh language tutor, said the town had \u201cembraced\u201d the festival, with many shops putting up Welsh language signs.\n\u201cYou can really see the benefit of having the eisteddfod here. People come here and they\u2019ll go away and want to learn more about [the Welsh language],\u201d she said.",

    "A Belfast doctor who was convicted of sex offences has been erased from the medical register by a medical tribunal.\nAndrew Gibson, from Marcus Ward Street in the city, has convictions for paying for sex and possessing an indecent photograph of children.\nThe General Medical Council referred Mr Gibson to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS).\nThe tribunal determined that his fitness to practise is impaired by reason of his convictions.\nIt also imposed an immediate order of suspension to cover the 28-day appeal period.\nThe 40-year-old studied medicine at Queen's University, Belfast, from where he qualified as a doctor in 2012.\nOn 7 December 2023, Gibson was convicted of obtaining sexual services from another person in exchange for payment and being in possession of an indecent photograph of children and two extreme pornographic images.\nHe was convicted at Laganside Magistrates' Court of paying for sex on dates between 15 and 18 June 2021, and again on 19 July of that year.\nHe was sentenced to a Probation Order for eighteen months and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for five years.\nThe PSNI wrote to the General Medical Council (GMC) in April 2022 to inform it of the allegations against Gibson.\nThe doctor's licence to practise medicine has been suspended since 31 August 2023, according to the GMC website.\nThe GMC is the independent regulator of doctors in the UK.\nIt referred Gibson's case to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) for it to decide if he should face sanctions.\nThe three-day tribunal opened on Wednesday, but Gibson did not attend, and he was not legally represented.\nThe tribunal concluded that \"suspension would be inappropriate and insufficient to mark the seriousness of Dr Gibson's behaviour, protect the public, uphold proper standards of conduct and behaviour and maintain public confidence in the medical profession\", said Mrs Remi Alabi, MPTS tribunal chair.\nShe described Gibson's convictions as \"very serious matters\" and said his actions \"breached both fundamental tenets of the medical profession and individual paragraphs of good manufacturing practices (GMP).\"\nThe tribunal chair said Gibson did not provide any evidence to \"demonstrate that he has attempted to address the concerns identified in this case or the root cause of his behaviour\".\nShe said, \"remediation in this case is likely to be particularly difficult in light of the nature of the offences under consideration\".\nMrs Alabi said Gibson had not \"demonstrated an understanding of the impact of his actions on patients, colleagues, the medical profession, the wider public interest or public confidence in the medical profession\" and had \"not engaged\" with his regulator or these proceedings.\nIt was noted that, in the pre-sentence report prepared for his criminal case, Gibson was assessed by probation services as \"posing a medium risk of reoffending in a two-year period\".\nIn the circumstances of this case, the tribunal considered that the \"only proportionate and appropriate sanction\" is one of erasure.\nThe tribunal chair said it considered that Gibson's convictions, in particular those relating to possession of one class C indecent image of children and two images of extreme pornography, are \"incompatible with continued registration as a doctor\".",
    "St Johnstone FC are investigating after midfielder Cammy MacPherson shared a post on social media by far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\nThe 25-year-old retweeted a film made by the English Defence League founder, in which he repeats false claims he made about a refugee that led to him losing a libel case in 2021.\nFans of the club voiced anger over the post on social media - after which MacPherson removed the retweet and made his X profile private.\nThe BBC understands St Johnstone has been made aware of the matter and is dealing with it internally.\nIt comes after violent unrest involving far-right groups in cities across England and Northern Ireland over the last week.\nPolice officers have been injured, places of worship attacked and businesses set on fire - including a Holiday Inn Express in Manvers, near Rotherham,  used to house more than 200 asylum seekers.\nThe disorder began the night after three young girls were killed in a knife attack at a dance class in Southport.\nConvicted criminal Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has since posted about \"pro-UK\" rallies in cities including Glasgow next month, saying \"the British are rising\".\nMacPherson reshared a post by Yaxley-Lennon from 27 July, two nights before the stabbing, promoting his film as \"Britain's banned documentary\".\nSt Johnstone supporters were quick to voice their disapproval.\nOne fan wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"When you\u2019ve got lots of good people as Saints do trying to build an inclusive club, having your starting midfielder retweeting [expletive] Robinson is absolutely minging.\"\nAnother said: \"Seeing Cammy MacPherson retweeting bile from Tommy Robinson confirms the boy\u2019s an absolute clown as well as a hopeless footballer, quicker he is out the team the better.\"\nYaxley-Lennon - an anti-Islamist activist - is the subject of an arrest warrant after leaving the country on the eve of a major legal case against him.\nHis Twitter account was suspended in 2018 as the company accused him of breaking its rules on hateful conduct.\nHowever he was reinstated on the platform last year after it was bought by Elon Musk.\nEarlier former Twitter executive Bruce Daisley said that Mr Musk was \"largely responsible\" for bringing Robinson back onto the platform.\nHe said this had amplified Robinson's voice \"to the extent that he has gone from really the bargain basement of politics to being one of the biggest names orchestrating potentially this ongoing racial conflict\".\nHe added: \u201cSo I think Elon Musk is playing a pretty pivotal role, and it's why it's such a challenge to try and to prohibit or to regulate what he's actually doing right now.\u201d",
    "Missing the sun this summer? It turns out we're not the only ones.\nButterflies need dry weather and heat to flourish, something they just have not been getting enough of this year.\nAnd that has conservationists worried.\nWith just one day left to go in the annual Butterfly Conservation\u2019s Big Butterfly Count, participants have so far recorded the lowest number ever in the 14-year history of the biggest citizen science project in the UK.\nInge Muller combines her love of moths and butterflies with her day job.\nAs a butterfly and moth recorder, she makes a mental note of the butterflies she sees as she does her County Londonderry postal round and fills in the results when she clocks off.\nShe says this year\u2019s results are not promising.\n\u201cIt is definitely not good,\" she tells BBC News NI.\n\"In three weeks in July and August, there are so many days that there is nothing to report.\u201d\nButterflies aren't the only insects which are absent.\n\u201cWe see the same in the numbers of moths,\" Ms Muller explains.\n\"We monitor some species that are very numerous that you would expect to see 30 or 40 in one night in your moth trap, you are only seeing two or three.\n\u201cThat tells you something, that some of the common species are not doing well.\u201d\nRosie Irwin of Butterfly Conservation says habitat loss, pesticide use and climate change are all impacting the population numbers.\nThis year\u2019s fall in numbers has been exacerbated by the wet spring and late arrival of summer temperatures.\nButterflies also need some warm and dry conditions to be able to fly around and mate.\nIf seasonal weather conditions are not ideal, the knock-on effect on an already dwindling population becomes more evident.\nThe fact that butterfly numbers have already declined by 80% in the UK since the 1970s, according to the Butterfly Conservation, means the species is less resilient to other challenges like the weather.\nAll is not lost.\nMs Irwin says we can all do something that will encourage butterflies into our gardens - whether that is small urban spaces or larger rural areas.\n\u201cCreate a space where they can complete their life cycle if possible, it doesn\u2019t have to be everything,\" she says.\nA nectar source can also act as a feed for caterpillars.\n\u201cSimple ones to grow are nasturtium for those cabbage whites, the small white and the large white butterflies, and things like sweet rocket for the orange tip butterfly,\u201d she says.\nMs Irwin says butterflies act as an indicator as to how healthy our ecosystems are.\n\u201cWhen butterfly numbers start to fluctuate, it is a warning sign of changes in habitat, changes in land use and changes in climate,\" she adds.\n\u201cFeed, breed and shelter.

    "The family of a man who was shot dead in an industrial estate on Merseyside seven weeks ago are begging people to \"do the right thing and speak up\".\nPolice launched a murder probe after Ellis Cox, 19, was found critically injured on the Liver Industrial Estate in Aintree on 23 June and died a short time later in hospital.\nMerseyside Police believe Mr Cox was shot with a self-loading pistol as he made his way home through the estate after a day out in Southport with friends.\nMr Cox's family have appealed to the relatives of anyone involved in his death to come forward.\n\"No normal person could live with themselves but it seems they are not normal but are their families, their mum, dad, siblings?,\" they said.\n\"We have to pray that they are and that with each hour that passes they realise they cannot stay silent and come forward. \n\"We know our children.

    "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreaks in parts of Africa a public health emergency of international concern.\nThe highly contagious disease - formerly known as monkeypox - has killed at least 450 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nMpox is caused by a virus in the same family as smallpox but is usually much less harmful.\nIt was originally transmitted from animals to humans but now also passes between humans.\nInitial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain and aching muscles.\nOnce the fever breaks, a rash can develop. It often begins on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\nThe rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. It can cause scarring.\nThe infection can clear up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days.\nBut in some cases it is fatal, particularly for vulnerable groups including small children. \nSerious cases can see lesions attack the whole of the body, especially the mouth, eyes and genitals.\nMpox is most common in remote villages in the tropical rainforests of West and Central Africa, in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), where it has been seen for many years.\nIn these regions, there are thousands of infections and hundreds of deaths from the disease annually, with children under 15 worst affected.\nThere are currently a number of different outbreaks happening simultaneously -  mainly in the DRC and neighbouring countries.\nThe disease has recently been seen in Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya, where it is not normally endemic.\nThere are broadly two main types of mpox  - Clade 1, which is often more serious, and Clade 2. \nThe Clade 1 virus - that has for decades caused sporadic outbreaks in DRC  - is spreading. \nSome forms of Clade 1 seem to be affecting children more than adults. \nThere is also real concern because many people infected in the last year have had a relatively new and more severe type of mpox known as Clade 1b.  \nExperts say there is a lot to learn about the Clade 1b but it may be spreading more easily, causing more serious disease.\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says there were more than 14,500 mpox infections and over 450 deaths from mpox between the start of 2024 and the end of July. That is a 160% increase in infections and a 19% increase in deaths compared with the same period in 2023.\nA previous mpox public health emergency, declared in 2022, was caused by the relatively mild Clade 2.\nIt spread to nearly 100 countries which do not normally see the virus, including some in Europe and Asia, but was brought under control by vaccinating vulnerable groups.\nMpox spreads from person to person through close contact with someone who is infected - including through sex, skin-to-skin contact and talking or breathing close to the ill person.\nThe virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth.\nIt can also be spread through touching objects which have been contaminated by the virus, such as bedding, clothing and towels.\nClose contact with infected animals, such as monkeys, rats and squirrels, is another route. \nDuring the global outbreak in 2022, the virus spread mostly through sexual contact.\nThe current outbreaks in DR Congo are being driven by sexual contact and by other forms of close contact. \nIt has been found in other vulnerable communities, including young children.\nAnyone who has close contact with someone with symptoms can catch the virus, including health workers and family members.\nSexual contact between infected adults is thought to be one of the reasons cases are rising.\nExperts are studying the situation to understand more about who is most at risk. \nYoung children may be among groups who are particularly vulnerable because their immune systems are still developing and many in the region have poor nutrition, making it harder to fight off disease.\nSome experts suggest younger children may be at risk because of the way they play and interact with each other closely. \nThey will also not have had access to the smallpox vaccine, discontinued more than four decades ago, that may offer older people some protection. \nAnyone with a weakened immune system may also be more prone to the disease and there is concern pregnant women may be at greater risk.\nAdvice is to avoid close contact with anyone with mpox and clean your hands with soap and water if the virus is in your community.\nThose who have mpox should isolate from others until all their lesions have disappeared.\nCondoms should be used as a precaution when having sex for 12 weeks after recovery, the WHO says.\nVaccines exist but only people at risk or who have been in close contact with an infected person are usually able to have it.\nThere is real worry that there is not enough funding for vaccine",

    "A fine dining restaurant is set to serve its final meals and close on its 24th anniversary.\nWorld Service, in Nottingham city centre, announced the closure in June due to changes in people's dining habits and the impact of the cost-of-living crisis. \nCo-owner Dan Lindsay said the restaurant had been fully booked for weeks since the announcement, saying it had been \"absolutely flat out\".\nFormer members of staff have even returned to help World Service cope with increased demand before its distinctive red gate, which customers walk through to access the restaurant, shuts for good on Saturday.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Lindsay said: \"It's been a huge outpouring of emotion and love and support from so many people, it's been really humbling.\n\"We've had customers in tears and it's an honour to have people so appreciative of what we've done.\"\nMr Lindsay said tying the final service with the restaurant's birthday \"makes sense\".\n\"I can't imagine what it's going to feel like, we're all very emotional,\" he said.\n\"My general manager has been with me pretty much since we opened, so I'm going to give him the honours of locking the red gate after the last people leave and then we'll all sit down and take it in and have a few drinks, celebrate the good times we've had here.\n\"My team has been amazing, I'm so proud. Everybody has worked tirelessly and has that goal to give the restaurant the send-off it deserves and seeing it through to the end.\"\nMr Lindsay previously said fine dining was \"not as popular as it used to be\", but acknowledged that the cost of living was \"very real\", with no business immune.\nHe added: \"Fine dining is a challenge. It's labour-intensive if you're busy or not so busy, you need the numbers there and it is tricky, it's easier to manage costs in a simpler operation.\n\"With the demand we've had, it does show there is that passion for it but with less disposable income, people maybe don't come here twice a year, they come here once.\n\"But it's unusual for restaurants to last this long.

    "Fishermen in Thanet say they have been \u201cpushed to one side, forgotten about and ignored\u201d after money for new facilities was redirected to a plan to reopen a Kent port.\nThanet District Council (TDC) said it had no choice but to reallocate \u00a33.5m slated for fishing upgrades to reopening Ramsgate's port due to government rules.\nThe move has brought the total budget for the Port of Ramsgate project to \u00a37.2m.\nTwo of the major levelling-up projects in Ramsgate are the port works and upgrades to fishing facilities in the town.\nIn 2021, TDC received almost \u00a320m from the government's Levelling-Up Fund for local regeneration projects, of which \u00a39m was for the harbour.\nThe Port of Ramsgate in its current form was built from 1979, and ran passenger services from 1981\u20132013.\nThe ambitious scheme is intended to improve the infrastructure surrounding the berths, where the vessels are moored, to allow it to come back into use for passenger services to Europe.\nAt a meeting of TDC\u2019s cabinet, members met to decide on rearranging the budget from the project, by diverting money intended for the fishing facilities plan, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nOriginally the plan was to create a site where the local fishing fleet could unload, freeze, store and process their catch at the harbour.\nCouncil leader Cllr Rick Everitt said a contract to operate two of the berths will \u201cbe tendered on the open market next month\u201d.\nSome \u00a33.5m from the fishing facilities upgrade programme was proposed to instead be redirected to the port and for a \u00a34.5m grant to be given to any prospective operator of the port.\n\u201cIt is not the case that this project has been downgraded in order to transfer the money elsewhere,\u201d said Cllr Everitt.\n\u201cWe could not take on ongoing costs on behalf of the fishermen which the council has no ability to meet.\u201d\nJohn Nichols, a committee member and a former chairman of the Thanet Fishermen\u2019s Association, said the loss of funding was \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve told us we\u2019re going to get \u00a3100,000, which won\u2019t even scratch the surface of the basic facilities,\u201d he said.\nThe local fishing fleet comprises 13 vessels compared with 30 a decade ago, he added.\n\u201cWe need these very basic facilities, we don\u2019t need to be pushed to one side, forgotten about and ignored,\u201d he said.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "An actor has thanked the people of Eric Morecambe\u2019s adopted home town for their warm reception at the world premiere of a new play depicting the comedian, in the theatre named after him.\nBob Golding, who lives in Northamptonshire, played the comedy great in the award-winning play Morecambe, and is returning to the character in Paul Hendy\u2019s The Last Laugh.\nHe said it was \"surprisingly emotional\" to complete a pre-Edinburgh Fringe run at the Eric Morecambe Centre in Harpenden, Hertfordshire.\nHe praised audiences in the town that has a \"huge affiliation\" with Morecambe and also thanked Luton Town FC for help with his costume.\nEric Morecambe and comedy partner Ernie Wise's much-loved double act spanned TV, radio and film for about 40 years until Eric's death in 1984.  \nThe Last Laugh depicts him with fellow comedy greats Tommy Cooper and Bob Monkhouse in a dressing room, discussing life, comedy and what it means to be funny.\nWriter Hendy said the idea came from vivid memories of watching the comedians with his family and coming to love and appreciate their different approaches to comedy.\nThe fact he knew three actors who had portrayed the characters before was a \"perfect storm\" and an Edinburgh run was sealed.\nGolding first played Eric in Morecambe, a one-man show about the star\u2019s life, which won an Edinburgh Fringe First Award in 2009 and the Olivier award for Best Entertainment in 2010. It toured until 2014.\nWith a seal of approval from Morecambe\u2019s son Gary and a sculpted head of the comedian in pride of place in the living room of the boat he lives on, he said he thought the iconic star had \"taken over my life\".\nTen years on, he said he was \"a little reticent\" about coming back to him because the previous play had been \"so successful\" and he had \"either got to match it or be better\".\n\"I was a bit nervous, a bit scared and I still am. I still get the old jelly legs much like Eric used to get,\" he said.\n\u201cIn the play Eric talks about the constant nagging doubt in the back of his mind, this need to rehearse things and still be funny, thinking 'are they still going to laugh?' - and that\u2019s still there for me.\"\n\"But I\u2019m really proud and excited about doing it again.\"\nGolding said that the play depicts the comedian near the end of his life so is at a \"much slower pace\" than the previous play.\n\"It's a more reflective Eric that I get to play, which actually at nearly 54 I\u2019m grateful for,\" he said.\n\"It\u2019s like meeting an old friend that you haven\u2019t seen for a while and getting the chance to give them a hug.\"\nHe added that the premiere in the town where Morecambe lived for much of his life felt appropriate.\n\"The people of Harpenden had a huge affiliation with Eric because they got to see him walking to the bank in the morning and being involved with the community,\" Golding, who lived in nearby St Albans for 16 years, said.\n\"I thought, if I\u2019m going to do it anywhere, let\u2019s do it here.

It signed an agreement with Cala Homes in 2018.\nLib Dem councillor Adam Bermange, the council\u2019s cabinet member for planning, governance and asset management, said he had \u201cspent countless hours\u201d trying to find a way out of the contract but that it was \u201cwell and truly bound\u201d.\nThe authority said the site is not designated as \u201copen space\u201d because it was bought by the former Maidenhead District Council\u2019s mayor in 1953 and has always been a private members\u2019 club.\nBut Mr Singh said the mayor said the course \u201cwould be for the exclusive use of the public and future generations of Maidenhead\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cWe should not be held hostage by the previous Conservative administration\u2019s shenanigans.\u201d\nLib Dem council leader Simon Werner said he was \u201creally sad\u201d Mr Singh left the party.\n\u201cI thought of him as a potential mayor. I wish him well in his future endeavours,\u201d he said.\nMr Singh's defection means he is Labour's sole councillor on the authority. \nThe Lib Dems have 21 councillors and nine councillors belong to the Local Independents group. \nThe authority also has seven Conservative councillors and three independents. \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A police officer was taken to hospital after being hit with a sledgehammer while responding to reports of criminal damage.\nA vehicle was used to ram the entrance of the Bristol HQ of defence technology firm Elbit Systems on Bolingbroke Way in Patchway, on the outskirts of Bristol, shortly before 04:00 BST.\nEmployees and police officers who intervened were assaulted, Avon and Somerset Constabulary said, and six people were arrested.\nSledgehammers, axes, whips and other homemade weapons were seized, police added. \nDuring the incident, two officers were assaulted with a sledgehammer, police said.\nOne of the officers was taken to hospital with injuries to her back and has since been discharged, while the other officer received medical treatment at the scene after being struck on the back of his legs.\nAn employee of the business was also treated by paramedics for an injury to their head.\nPolice said six people aged 20-30 years old were arrested on suspicion of a range of offences including Section 18 wounding with intent, aggravated burglary, burglary and criminal damage.\nVideos shared to social media by campaign group Palestine Action showed people using tools to cut into the warehouse, damaging equipment inside the building and spraying red paint on the premises. \nThe direct action group says it aims to disrupt arms sales to Israel, and claims Elbit Systems UK sells equipment to the state's army. \nElbit Systems UK Limited has previously said in court it does not supply Israel with arms. \nSupt Deepak Kenth said officers remained at the scene of the incident, examining CCTV, speaking to witnesses and examining the vehicle used.\n\"These are not protests, these are criminal offences being committed - very serious criminal offences,\" he said. \nHe confirmed officers were looking to make further arrests \"in the coming hours and days\", and said anyone who carried out similar offences should \"expect to be dealt with robustly\". \nSupt Kenth described the actions of those who injured officers as \"disgraceful\". \n\"Police officers are mums, dads, uncles, aunties, brothers and sisters, like anyone else.

    "Looted shops have been repaired and replenished, fires put out and glass swept up. But for the communities left in fear by the riots, the return to normality is taking much longer. BBC News visits Hull, one of the numerous towns and cities affected.\nFrancis Ahiakpa is standing in the cramped kitchen of Humber All Nations Alliance (HANA), an organisation that has been supporting migrant communities for nearly 20 years.\nIn front of him are dozens of polystyrene containers where there should be stacks of plates. \n\"We hold a weekly breakfast food bank,\" explains Mr Ahiakpa, the organisation's chief officer. \"It's not just about feeding people; it's an opportunity to come together and talk.\n\"But people have been too scared to stay and eat with us, because they think someone will walk in and attack them, so we've been giving food out in takeaway containers.\n\"We've even been delivering to people's homes.\"\nNearly two weeks on from the 3 August riot, when shops were looted and police attacked with bricks and fireworks, there are few physical reminders of the trouble.\nBut fears linger.   \n\"The level of fear is still really high,\" says Mr Ahiakpa. \"People are still saying to me, 'I'm not sure I can come to your offices, can you please bring me [a food parcel] again?' That is the level of anxiety.\"\nIt is not the Hull that Mr Ahiakpa \u2013 who came to the UK from Ghana in 2002 to study for a masters degree in business management \u2013 knows and loves; the home of William Wilberforce, the MP who played a pivotal part in abolishing the British slave trade in 1807.\n\"That level of hatred,\" he says, shaking his head. \"I never thought I would see that here, in 2024. Not in my wildest imagination did I see it coming here. I was surprised, shocked and saddened.\"\nAngela Murden, of the Hull African Caribbean Association, says the riot has had \"a ripple effect\".\nHer organisation also runs a food bank. Last week, they gave out just 12 food bags when usually between 30 and 40 are distributed. \n\"People are keeping away,\" she says. \nUnlike Mr Ahiakpa, she saw the riot coming. \"It's the misinformation. Social media. Rumours.\n\"Look at the ease at which they rioted. They had no respect for people or property.\" \nAccording to Humberside Police, 29 people have been charged and more than 60 arrests made in connection with the disorder. Some of the rioters have already been jailed. \nMs Murden says she welcomes the custodial sentences, but believes that alone will not prevent a reoccurrence.\n\"There is a desperate need for education, it's a big problem,\" she adds. \nSyed Shah, from Humber Community Advice Services, which provides information and advocacy services to people from minority ethnic communities, takes a holistic view towards those responsible.\nHe refuses to label the rioters as \"bad people\".\n\"Things are never black and white,\" says Mr Shah, who moved to the UK from Afghanistan in 2022 with his wife and two children. \"You can't divide everyone into good and bad.\"\nIt is clear who Mr Shah blames for the disorder. \"People who are misinformed and are fed false information will do things they would not normally do,\" he says. \n\"If you are continually saying foreigners are coming over here and taking jobs, some will believe it.

She labels them \"bandits\".\nBack at HANA, Mr Ahiakpa believes \"a cultural conversation\" needs to be had and is vowing to arrange more visits to schools and colleges.\n\"Every time we go into schools we find children who are incredibly curious about different cultures,\" he says.\n\"The key to preventing future rioting is talking. We need to have honest conversations in our communities about race \u2013 and that needs to begin in our schools.\"\nMr Ahiakpa believes those who rioted need to consider the \"bigger picture\".\n\"A large number of staff in our hospitals are migrant workers,\" he says. \"Would they be prepared to wait longer to see a white doctor or nurse? \n\"When they go on their holidays, would they refuse to board the aeroplane if they discovered the pilot was black?\"\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0",
    "On 9 July, Diana Cazacu, a 19-year-old hiker, was mauled to death by a young female bear in the Bucegi mountains north of Bucharest. In response, the government overturned a 2016 moratorium on bear hunting - and reignited a fierce debate about what to do with Romania's growing bear population, the largest in Europe outside Russia.\nThe staff at the Salvamont headquarters, Romania\u2019s mountain rescue service, radiate calm and efficiency. \nWhen Diana and her boyfriend rang the emergency number, 112, in panic at 15:00 on 9 July, the call was transferred here.\nSergiu Frusinoiu, in charge that day, set out immediately with two teams. One approached the incident spot from above, the other from below. Bears rarely attack humans, except in self-defence - so Sergiu assumed this would be a simple rescue mission.\nAt the scene they found the woman\u2019s distraught boyfriend. The bear had grabbed Diana, and thrown her down the ravine. They descended by rope, and found the bear standing over the victim.\nThe bear attacked the rescue team, who defended themselves with pepper spray, firecrackers and rocks, until a hunter arrived and shot the bear. It was too late for Diana, lying on her stomach, her head in the stream.\n\u201cEven if the fall or her injuries didn\u2019t kill her, the water could have,\u201d Sergiu told me. \nHe said Diana's mistake had been to run away when faced with the bear. Sergiu grew up in these mountains, and has had hundreds of encounters with bears, without incident, he said.\nThe standard advice is to make noise in bear territory as you walk. If you encounter a bear, stand quiet and still, then back slowly away. As with a dog, the worst thing you can do is run away, as it is sure to follow.\nAt the base of the footpath which Diana climbed that day, it becomes clear why the bear was on the path. Three large municipal waste bins, the remains of a cage around one, stand open to the sky. One has been tipped over, and there is rotting food, tins and plastic strewn over a wide area.\nAround 8,000 bears live in the arc of the Carpathian mountains, one of Europe\u2019s last wilderness regions, their habitat constantly eroded by logging, the spread of towns, and tourism.\nIn the nearby town of Busteni, at seven in the evening, I get a bear alert on my phone, and rush to the scene, a residential street. \nAngry locals say they\u2019re afraid to walk home at night, because of the bears. \nThe police arrive, and the locals harangue them for doing too little. \u201cBut what do you want us to do?\u201d asks a young officer. \u201cKeep us safe!\u201d shouts one man.\nI get through to the hunter who shot the bear who killed Diana, but he says he will not speak until the inquest is over. \nFormer Environment Minister Barna Tanczos is the author of the new law, passed by the Chamber of Deputies and approved by President Klaus Iohannis in July, that allows people to kill up to 500 bears over the next 18 months .\n\u201cThe bear population is increasing daily, monthly, yearly in Romania, so if we don\u2019t do something we will have thousands, tens of thousands of bears, which is not good for humans, and not good for the bears,\" Mr Tanczos said. \n\"So we have to establish control, we need a balance in human - bear relations, and conflicts, and contacts.\u201d\nAccording to Cristi Remus Papp, head of the large carnivore department of the Worldwide Fund for Nature, the new law will do nothing to improve the situation, and could make it worse. \nThere is a growing number of \u201ctroublesome\u201d bears, he admits, but there are no accurate statistics for how many bears there are overall. \nIn any case, the number is not the point, he says: \u201cWe have to address the root causes of the conflicts, starting with the mass feeding of bears close to settlements, and along the roads in tourist areas.\u201d\nSince the communist era, hunters' associations are obliged by law to feed the bears - a practice initially meant to make them easier to shoot, and keep them out of towns, but is now partly done for tour operators, who want to guarantee a sighting of bears to their clients.\nSocial media feeds are full of video clips of tourists feeding bears from their cars. A future change in the law could be to fine those who do so.\nOther bear management methods have been tried with some success - like tranquillising and removing bears to wild areas of the mountains. But now that bears have got into the habit of raiding bins or begging for food, even conservationists say there may be no alternative to culling them.\nOne example of good practice is the town of Baile Tusnad.\n\u201cIn 2021 we had 220 bear alerts. This year so far, only 3,\u201d Zsolt Butyka, the mayor told me proudly. His municipality bought 14 neat, stainless steel bear-proof bins, cut down 50 fruit trees in the town, and ran regular bear awareness campaign for the public.\nA poster near the town hall reads: \u201cIf you feed a bear, you kill a bear.\u201d\nThe town is on a main migration route for bears, across the Olt river valley, but now they skirt round the edges. \u201cThey\u2019ve learnt there\u2019s no",
    "A Republican senate candidate in Minnesota has taken a meandering path from sport into politics, where he has earned support from the far-right fringes. \nNow he faces a difficult battle to enter Congress.\nRoyce White, a former standout basketball player, won the GOP primary on Tuesday, capturing 38.5% of the vote in a crowded eight-candidate field.\nHe was seen as an underdog before he won the endorsement of the state party delegates in May. But his fringe views and tough competition in the form of incumbent Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar mean that he is a longshot to win the general election.\n\nMr White, a Minnesota native, was a star high school player on two state championship teams before taking the court at Iowa State University.\nHe was drafted by the Houston Rockets in 2012 even though his severe fear of flying hampered his ability to travel.\nUltimately he saw little action in the league, playing in just three games, and later tried his hand at mixed martial arts and Big3, the 3-on-3 basketball league co-founded by rapper Ice Cube.\nMeanwhile, his openness about his struggles with mental health issues, including anxiety, gave him a wide public platform. \nAfter the murder of George Floyd in his home state in 2020, Mr White, who is black, organised and led protests, although he says on his web site these were separate from the larger Black Lives Matter demonstrations that swept through the country.\nSince then, Mr White\u2019s politics have taken an increasingly rightward and conspiratorial turn. \nA frequent guest on Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room podcast, he has occasionally slid into the hosting chair while Bannon \u2013 former chief strategist to Donald Trump \u2013 serves time in prison for contempt of Congress.\nIn 2022, Mr White tried to challenge progressive Democrat Ilhan Omar for her US House seat in Minneapolis, but he failed to make the first step, losing the Republican primary.\nAlong the way Mr White has racked up a list of controversies. \nWhile playing in Big3 games, he\u2019s written political slogans on his bald scalp including \u201cUnited States of the Federal Reserve\u201d, \u201cDeep state\u201d and \u201cAlex Jones was right\u201d \u2013 his campaign website currently includes an endorsement from the conspiracy theorist.\nA watchdog group has alleged in a complaint to the Federal Elections Commission that his House campaign spent more than $150,000 (\u00a3117,000) on White\u2019s personal expenses including gym fees, clothing and bills at a strip club.\nHe has repeated conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic and about \u201cJewish elites\", and also made public statements that have raised the ire of people in his party and out, such as saying that \u201cwomen have become too mouthy\u201d.\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition labelled him anti-Semitic and opposed him in the primary election after he made comments about Jewish people and supporting Kanye West.\nMr White has accused his critics of being in a \u201cwhite liberal ivory tower\u201d and argued that he is being attacked for holding conservative values.\nHis campaign \u2013 which the BBC reached out to for comment \u2013 has posted a long rebuttal of criticisms against him. Among them, Mr White says that he has accounted for most of his campaign funds and rejects charges of anti-Semitism.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr White was seen as highly unlikely to capture the Republican Senate nomination against his main opponent, Joe Fraser, a military veteran and businessman.\nHowever, his association with Bannon and his controversial statements \u201ccreated an explosion of enthusiasm and support for him at the Republican convention among the anti-establishment far-right,\" said Larry Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota.\nMr White won the endorsement of the state party at that meeting in May. \nMr Fraser briefly considered dropping out of the race but continued on to Tuesday\u2019s primary with the endorsements of a number of prominent Minnesota Republicans. The establishment support wasn\u2019t enough, and he garnered a little less than 30% of the vote.\nCelebrating his underdog victory, Mr White posted on X: \u201cI am committed to growing the base, bringing disenfranchised Democrats into the tent, and unifying all conservatives in Minnesota.\u201d\nBut now he faces a major challenge in trying to unseat Ms Klobuchar, a popular Democrat  who won her last re-election  with more than 60% of the vote.\nThe state Democratic Party called him \"a far-right extremist. \nAnd Mr Jacobs, the politics professor, gives Mr White \u201cno chance\u201d of winning in November.\n\u201cAmy Klobuchar is popular even among Republicans, she has $6m in the bank, and I doubt that Royce White is going to raise very much money at all,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s not one aspect of this race that favours Royce White.\u201d\nThe race, he says, is yet another indication of how the Republican Party is now dominated by Donald Trump and the Maga movement.\n\u201cSometimes Trump has been able to get behind candidates who prevail,\u201d Mr Jacobs said, citing JD Vance's victory in the Ohio senate race in 2022. \u201cBut you a",

    "The titan arum plant is famed for producing the stench of rotten meat and is ominously called the \u201ccorpse flower\u201d in its native Sumatra.\nYou might think this endangered plant is doing everything in its power to be as unpleasant as possible - but the smell is actually designed to lure carrion-eating insects for pollination.\nAnd crowds have flocked to catch a glimpse, and a sniff, of the \u201cworld\u2019s smelliest plant\u201d after it bloomed for just the fifth time at Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Botanic Gardens.\nMore than 2,500 people have crammed in to the institution\u2019s glasshouse over the last two days for a chance to see the 2.6m (8.7ft) tall bloom before it disappears for at least the next two years.\nNicknamed \u201cNew Reekie\u201d in honour of Edinburgh's former moniker, the plant is scientifically known as Amorphophallus Titanium.\n\u201cTo me it smells like a beach with rotting seaweed, it almost has a fishy sort of smell,\u201d said tropical plant expert Dr Axel Dalberg Poulsen - who cares for and studies the plant at the gardens.\n\u201cWhen the smell is really bad, at its strongest, it can stick to your clothes, you can be smelling it for days afterwards.\u201d\nThe plant was gifted to the Gardens in 2002 after being sown at the Hortus Botanicus facility in the Dutch city of Leiden.\nAt that stage the \u201ccorm,\u201d the underground structure from which the plant grows, was the size of an orange.\nEight years later, the gardens had to borrow scales used to weigh elephants at Edinburgh Zoo, after it grew to more than 150kg \u2013 making it one of the largest specimens ever recorded.\nThe corm spends long periods absorbing massive amounts of energy and nutrients from the soil before releasing it in a surge that creates one of the tallest flowering structures of any plant.\nIt did not flower for the first time until 2015, but has since steadily bloomed every two to three years.\n\u201cIn a sense, it might never die,\u201d said Dr Dalberg Poulsen.\n\u201cThe first time it flowered here in 2015, we thought it would die after it finished flowering, it would have exhausted itself but it didn\u2019t.\n\u201cTropical plants have a root that grows along the ground, they can do that theoretically forever.\u201d\nThe plant has been a popular attraction for horticultural enthusiasts in Europe since first being described by Italian botanist Odoardo Beccari in 1878.\nA specimen brought to London\u2019s Kew Gardens brought thousands of visitors to its first bloom in 1889 due to its strong smell and otherworldly appearance.\nRenovations to the glasshouses in Edinburgh meant visitor numbers were restricted and access to the plant was ticketed.\nSadie Barber, the gardens\u2019 research collections manager, said the scent is at its strongest just after the bloom and is usually emitted at night when pollinators in its native environment are most active.\n\u201cSome people have really sensitive noses and get really nauseous and have to leave,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPeople think it smells like cheese, rotten meat, fish, rotten onions, even some people smell sweetness, which is odd. But I think the most accurate one really is rotting meat, because that is what it is trying to mimic.\n\u201cThankfully, we haven\u2019t had anyone throwing up yet.\u201d\nHowever, not everyone is turned off by the scent.\nHorticulturist Paulina Maciejewska Daruk said one woman described it as \u201clovely\u201d when she visited the glasshouse during a previous bloom.\nShe said the plant once grew \u201cabundantly\u201d in Sumatra's remote, monsoon-soaked rainforests.\nHowever, deforestation caused by farming and logging on the Indonesian island had heavily restricted its environment.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ranked it as facing a \u201cvery high risk of extinction\u201d in the wild.\nShe said it was now far more common to see the plant in a botanical institution.\n\u201cThe steeper slopes in Sumatra were safe from being deforested and turned into fields for farming,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut the more gentle slopes were not. They are gone, and people are getting desperate for resources, so there is a lot of logging, that is why it is endangered now.\n\u201cIt is unusual to see the flower now if you were on holiday in Sumatra unless you go somewhere really remote in the right season.\u201d",
    "Model Chloe Ayling was kidnapped after being lured to a fake photo shoot in Milan. She was released six days later, but her ordeal was far from over - seven years on, she is still being called a liar.\n\"Headlines really stick in people's minds, even years later,\" Ms Ayling tells the BBC, explaining that she still receives online abuse from people questioning her account.\nHer story is being told in a new six-part BBC series, Kidnapped: The Chloe Ayling Story. The series, which follows Chloe's experience being kidnapped and the media storm that followed, is based on police interviews, court transcripts and personal accounts - with some scenes created for dramatic purposes.\nMs Ayling faced years of doubts about her ordeal with people accusing her of faking her abduction, profiting from it and being involved in a publicity stunt.\nBut she's since worked with the drama's writer Georgia Lester and producers to tell her story.\n\"All I wanted was [the] facts to be laid out and everyone to know what actually happened,\" Ms Ayling says.\nShe hopes her experience will help others. \"This should be a lesson for people not to judge victims based on the way they act or react,\" she adds.\nMs Ayling's ordeal began in July 2017 when she was lured from London to Italy on the promise of a photo shoot by Lukasz Herba, who drugged her and took her to a remote farmhouse in a holdall bag.\nLukasz Herba said she would be sold online if she could not provide a $300,000 (approximately \u00a3230,000) ransom fee. He released her to the British consulate in Milan six days later.\nWhen Ms Ayling, then 20 years old, returned to the UK she came under fire - she was accused of posing for the cameras and smiling.\nFinding herself at the centre of so much media attention, Ms Ayling remembers: \"It was just so big and overpowering. \n\"It was blown out of proportion, there were things that were missed out and it was going in a direction that was not true.\"\nOn the topic of smiling when she arrived home from Italy, Ms Ayling says: \"That was genuinely how I was feeling at the time. I was happy to be home. I was happy this was over, so why shouldn't I be smiling?\"\nEven after Lukasz Herba, a Polish national, was jailed for 16 years and nine months for her kidnapping, people continued to accuse her of not telling the truth.\nMs Ayling feels her work as a model contributed to how she was treated: \"I do believe if my job was different, it wouldn't be the same reaction,\" adding that the way a victim dresses, acts or shows emotion shouldn't be a reason not to believe them.\nAfter her kidnapping, Ms Ayling published a book and appeared as a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother.\nDespite the backlash she received, she wouldn't change anything about how she behaved, she says.\n\"I was true to myself and did what I want[ed] to do, so I don't have any regrets.\"\nThe BBC drama comes as her kidnapper's brother, Michal Herba, who was also involved in Ms Ayling's abduction, has been released from prison. He was sentenced to 16 years and eight months in prison but had his sentence reduced after an appeal.\n\"I think he should have been in prison for a lot longer,\" Ms Ayling says of Michal Herba. \n\"The fact that they still don't take accountability and still want to make lies and not be responsible for what they did [is] even more annoying,\" she adds.\nNow, years on from her abduction, Ms Ayling is trying to put what happened behind her.\n\"I don't get flashbacks or anything like that,\" she says, but in making this drama the 27-year-old had to relive the experience.\n\"I [had] to put myself back in that position to remember key details and how I felt at the time,\" she says.\nThe series writer, Georgia Lester - who has also worked on dramas Killing Eve and Skins - says: \"I think the wider story here is about how we treat victims, specifically women.\"\nShe adds: \"It feels like a timely and important drama.\" \nIn July, the National Police Chiefs' Council outlined the scale of violence against women and girls across the nation in a report - and the body estimates that one in every 12 women will be a victim of violence every year.\nAmanda Rowe, the lead for violence against women and girls at the Independent Office for Police Conduct, acknowledges some people \"do not have a good experience\" when it comes to reporting violence against women and girls.\n\"Fear of being made to feel responsible for what has happened to them can put people off reporting these crimes,\" she says.\nMs Lester says she was enraged to learn how Ms Ayling had been treated following her kidnapping. She hopes the BBC drama \"encourages people to believe women\" and that it will \"vindicate\" Ms Ayling in \"the eyes of people who judged her\".\nMs Ayling adds: \"I want the world to know that what I'm saying is true.\"\nYou can watch Kidnapped: The Chloe Ayling Story on BBC iPlayer on Wednesday 14 August.\nAdditional reporting by Sabrina Fearon-Melville.

    "About 145,000 pupils across Scotland are receiving their exam results.\nHere is everything you need to know on SQA results day.\nPupils in Scotland receive their results on Tuesday 6 August.\nThe results cover Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers, as well as the more vocational National Progression Awards, Skills for Work Awards, and National Certificates.\nThe results were sent out by first-class post but many students opted to receive their grades digitally.\nText messages and emails were due to be sent to candidates who had an activated MySQA account from 08:00 onwards.\nHowever, pupils received emails with a blank space where their results should be. Some candidates also failed to get texts initially, leading to anxious waits. \nIf you have opted to receive your results by post, it will depend on when your mail normally arrives.\nCourses at National 5, Higher, and Advanced Higher are graded A-D.\nNational 2, National 3, and National 4 courses are not graded \u2014 the units that make up these courses are assessed as pass or fail.\nGrade boundaries vary from year to year and the exact percentages for 2024 won't be published until results day.\nHowever, the SQA sets initial grade boundaries for their assessments at 50% for a C, 70% for an A, and 85% for an Upper A.\nThese boundaries are the starting point for deciding the final grade boundaries each year.\nA grade D is a pass.\nIf you receive a grade D result this usually means you scored between 40 and 49% in the course assessment.\nCandidates who score less than 40% are not awarded a national course and will receive a no award result.\nThe number of pupils achieving an A, B or C grade at National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher was down across the board.\nThe Higher A-C attainment dropped from 77.1% in 2023 to 74.9%, while the A-C attainment for National 5 exams fell from 78.8% in 2023 to 77.2%.\nThe biggest drop in A-C grades came from Advanced Highers, which fell from 79.8% in 2023 to 75.3%.\nThe SQA noted that there had been different approaches to awarding in each year since 2019 which did not allow for \"meaningful conclusions to be drawn on changes in education performance\".\nThere is lots of support available if you don't get the results you are hoping for.\nThe SQA's candidate advice line will open at 08:00 on results day and will stay open until 18:00.\nGuidance staff at your school will also be on hand to provide help.\nIf you have a conditional offer for university or college that you don't meet, you can apply to Ucas' clearing process which is used by universities and colleges to fill empty places.\nSkills Development Scotland (SDS), the agency which supports training and skills for work, will also operate an advice line from 6 to 9 August.\nIf you need help and advice about the next steps in your career or education or if you didn't get the results you hoped for you can phone the SDS results helpline number on 0808 100 8000.\nYes, and every year thousands of pupils do.\nBefore anyone sits an exam their school, college or training centre submits estimated grades for every candidate to the SQA.\nIf you don't think your grade is correct, you should first talk to your school or college.\nIt will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed.\nYou can also submit your own appeal.\nAppeals will be subject to a marking review - a check that marks have been added up and submitted correctly and a check that the marking meets the national standard.\nAn appeal can be prioritised if you have a conditional place at university or college, or are in training or employment that depends on your grade.\nThe deadline for priority appeals is Tuesday 13 August, or Tuesday 27 August for other appeals.\nIn 2023, over 39,000 of the 540,920 certificated grades were appealed.\nA total of 3,980 appeal requests resulted in an upgrade while five resulted in a downgrade.\nThis means the success rate is around 10%.",
    "Sir Andy Murray has been hailed as Scotland's \"greatest ever sportsman\", as the three-time Grand Slam winner's career came to an end at the Paris Olympics.\nTributes poured in from the world of sport and beyond, as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Scotland's First Minister John Swinney hailed the tennis star.\nMurray and partner Dan Evans were defeated in the quarter-finals of the men's doubles, losing in straight sets to the American duo Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul.\nIn a glittering career he won Wimbledon twice - in 2013 and 2016 - as well as the US Open in 2012 and two Olympic gold medals in London 2012 and Rio 2016. \nHe also played a key part in helping Great Britain win the Davis Cup in 2015 and spent 41 weeks at the top of the tennis rankings as world number one.\nThe 37-year-old announced prior to the Olympics that it would be his final tournament.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on social media that Sir Andy had provided \"two decades of phenomenal entertainment and sportsmanship.\"\nScotland's First Minister John Swinney also paid his respects to Dunblane-born Murray, who has struggled with injury problems in recent years.\nHe said: \"Sir Andy Murray is Scotland\u2019s greatest ever sportsman, and his achievements during one of the toughest eras in tennis history will mark him down as a true sporting legend.\n\u201cThe whole of Scotland is so proud of Sir Andy and while we are disappointed that we will no longer get to see him compete with his trademark fighting spirit, we thank him for the incredible memories he gave us over so many years.\u201d\nThe Scotland National Football Team wrote on X: \"Thanks for the memories, Andy Murray. All the best in retirement - you're welcome at Hampden Park any time.\"\nMurray's mum, Judy Murray, shared a photo of her son at the age of five during his first tennis match.\nMurray and Evans had already been part of two dramatic encounters n Paris, saving five match points in the first round tie against Taro Daniel and Kei Nishikori before winning, then defeating Belgian pair Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen in another three set encounter.\nHowever Fritz and Paul - the third seeds in the draw - proved too tough to overcome.\nSpeaking after the defeat to the BBC, Murray called it a \"great run\" and said he had been \"ready\" for retirement for the past few months.\nHe added he was looking forward to spending time with his family, while he drily posted a message on social media account X that simply read \"Never even liked tennis anyway\".\nOlympic gold medal cyclist Victoria Pendleton told BBC Radio 5 Live that Murray had been \"such a hero\" during his career.\nShe added:  \"I think he's given so much to British sport and the Olympics indeed. I've been lucky enough to meet Andy on a few occasions and he has always been humble, driven and kind and that speaks volumes.\n\"His legacy is undoubtedly enormous in the wake of him retiring from sport.\"\nTennis Scotland chief executive Blane Dodds said that Murray's play had \"inspired a generation with his excellence on court, extraordinary work ethic and resolve during difficult moments\".\nHe added: \u201cHis successes have motivated many people to get involved in helping to grow and develop tennis in Scotland, whether that\u2019s within Tennis Scotland or as a coach, official, volunteer or young player.\"\nSportscotland chief executive Forbes Dunlop said the tennis star's impact on Scottish sport as as whole \"can't be measured\".  \nHe stated: \"His dedication, performances and achievements mean he will rightly go down in history as one of Scotland\u2019s greatest ever athletes.\" \nAfter years of success Sir Andy's career was feared to be over in 2019, when a metal cap was inserted into his hip.\nHowever, he resumed his career later that year, before an emotional farewell at Wimbledon in July and his Olympics bow.",
    "The family of a carer who was stabbed to death say Scottish ministers have done nothing to create a high-security psychiatric facility for women.\nMichele Rutherford\u2019s daughter Amy says it is \"unacceptable\" that there is nowhere in Scotland for her mother\u2019s killer - who will be treated at a facility in Wales.\nMrs Rutherford, 54, was killed at Craighall Court supported accommodation in Stirling in March 2023, by resident Kellyanne McNaughton.\nAmy, her sister Lyndsay and their father William have raised concerns with the Scottish government and say they want to make sure McNaughton cannot harm again.\nAmy told BBC Scotland News: \u201cWe don\u2019t particularly care about that individual.\n\"But we want them to get the help and support they need, which will then make everyone else safer and not put anyone else at risk.\u201d\nThe family will meet Justice Secretary Angela Constance and Social Care Minister Maree Todd later to seek progress.\nMs Todd told BBC Scotland News that the Scottish government is in the \"very early stages\" of reopening Carstairs, Scotland\u2019s State Hospital, to female patients.\nThe facility currently only takes male patients.\nMrs Rutherford was care manager at the supported accommodation where McNaughton, 33, was a resident.\nMcNaughton was originally charged with murder but in January this year prosecutors accepted a plea to the lesser charge of culpable homicide.\nSentencing was delayed several times due to problems finding a secure hospital to accommodate her.\nMrs Rutherford\u2019s family attended multiple court hearings where they learned there had been failed discussions about transferring McNaughton to two clinics, as well as the Rampton Secure Hospital in England.\nAmy said the court process had been traumatic.\nShe said: \u201cWe\u2019re not really a priority and they don\u2019t really care what it\u2019s putting families through and kind of neglect that whole side of it.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t guided through it like we would like to be.\u201d\nIn June, it was confirmed that McNaughton would receive treatment at the Priory Hospital Llanarth Court in Monmouthshire, Wales \u2013 deemed a medium-risk facility.\nBut the family say McNaughton should only be in a high secure facility, the highest level of secure mental health care in Scotland. \nThis is for patients who pose \"a grave and immediate danger to others if at large\".\nHowever, there is no facility at this level for women in Scotland.\nMcNaughton stabbed Mrs Rutherford repeatedly during the attack in March last year.\nStaff had tried to get McNaughton psychiatric help after she reported hearing voices but were told she would have to go to a GP to get a new referral.\nMichele\u2019s husband William said sending McNaughton to the medium-risk facility in Wales was \"just endangering staff\".\n\u201cThey\u2019ve categorised these people for a reason,\" he said.\n\"To me, if you\u2019ve got a high-risk person they go into a high-risk facility \u2013 that facility is geared up to deal with that person. \n\"Why are you putting a high-risk person into a medium-risk facility that\u2019s maybe not geared up for them, the staff isn\u2019t trained to the right levels.\" \nIn recent years a small number of women in Scottish prisons with specialist mental health care needs have been sent to Rampton high-security hospital in Nottinghamshire.\nA review in 2021 said sending women requiring high secure psychiatric to England was \u201cindefensible\u201d and that Carstairs should be reopened to women within nine months. This did not happen.\nHowever, Ms Todd said that \"there will be forensic, high-secure care for women in Scotland in the future\" and that the Scottish government was committed to the issue. \nShe said \"a lot of collaboration within the system\" would be required for Carstairs to be used for women again, citing building work, staffing work and security issues as hurdles to be overcome.\nMs Todd added that the decision to place McNaughton in a medium-risk facility was made \"due to to a clinical decision\u2026 about the level of care that they need and the level of security that they need\".\nThe family said the timing of the proposal was suspicious and still \u201ctoo late for them\u201d.\nThey feel their mother has been lost in much of the media coverage about McNaughton.\nIn a statement issued through Victim Support Scotland, the family said: \"While the Scottish government are publicly stating that progress is being made towards the creation of a high-security female psychiatric unit in Scotland, we see little evidence of this. \n\"Having stated that \u2018doing nothing is not an option,\u2019 we were given no clear assurances regarding timescales and a roadmap for a high-risk female psychiatric unit in Scotland.\n\u201cFurthermore, should a high-risk facility eventually be introduced, we remain extremely concerned and distressed that there is no firm plan to automatically relocate women who have been placed out with Scotland due to lack of facilities.\"\nMichele Rutherford worked as a carer and care manager for two decades.\nShe loved family walks along the beach in Ayr and holidays together in Florida i",
    "Justin Timberlake had his driving licence suspended in the state of New York, as he pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving while intoxicated. \nThe pop star was arrested 18 June for going through a stop sign and failing to stay on the right side of the road.\nTimberlake, 43, appeared virtually from Europe where he is on tour as he was formally charged with the crime in Sag Harbor, New York. \nSag Harbor Village Justice Justice Carl Irace suspended Timberlake's driving licence for an undetermined period, as is standard after a DWI arrest. \nTimberlake's lawyer has denied he was under the influence at the wheel and says the charges should be dismissed.\nOn Friday, Timberlake wore a black-collared shirt and spoke twice during the virtual court hearing, answering \"yes\" to questions from the judge. \nHe was appearing from Germany, where he is preparing to perform in Antwerp, Belgium, this weekend. \nThe 10-time Grammy winner missed his first court hearing last week because of his world tour, called Everything I Thought It Was. \nThe court had to hold another hearing because of a paperwork issue to formally charge him with the crime. \nThe actor and pop star was stopped shortly after midnight in Sag Harbor in the Hamptons, a popular summer destination for celebrities on Long Island.\nWhen officers pulled him over, Timberlake's eyes were \"bloodshot and glassy\" and a \"strong odour of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath\", according to a charging document.\nHe refused a breathalyser test and performed poorly on sobriety tests, the police said. \n\"I had one martini and I followed my friends home,\" Timberlake allegedly told the officer who stopped him.\nDuring Friday's hearing, Judge Irace reportedly criticised the defence lawyer, Edward Burke, for making \"irresponsible\" comments to journalists outside court.\nHe said he would impose a gag order on the attorney if he continued to make such remarks, NBC reported. \n\"It comes off as an attempt to poison the case before it even begins,\" Judge Irace was quoted as saying.\nMr Burke told reporters last week that police had made \"a number of very significant errors\". \n\u201cThe most important fact to know about this case is that Justin was not intoxicated and should not have been arrested for DWI,\u201d he said.\nIn New York, penalties for charges related to driving while intoxicated include up to a year in jail, a $1,000 (\u00a3786) fine and the suspension of a driver\u2019s licence for at least six months.\nTimberlake - who has been open about struggles with excessive drinking in the past - referred to the arrest days afterwards at a performance in Chicago. \n\"It's been a tough week,\" the Cry Me A River singer told the crowd.

    "A rape survivor who received multiple letters from her jailed attacker has criticised a prison for failing \"to keep victims safe\".\nHMP Parc in Bridgend, south Wales, is already under pressure after 10 prisoners died in three months earlier this year.\nRieve Nesbitt-Marr, 21, waived her right to anonymity to tell the BBC she was sent seven letters from her rapist in 10 months, despite pleading with authorities to take action.\nHMP Parc said it takes public protection \"extremely seriously\" and that it had tried to stop the letters.\nWarning: This report contains detail some people may find distressing\nMs Nesbitt-Marr had been seeing John Harding, 28, for just 12 days when he imprisoned her in her flat and raped her in July 2023.\nAt one point during the prolonged attack, in which he also stood on her head and dragged her along the floor, he told her she was \"not scared enough\".\nMs Nesbitt-Marr escaped her flat in Newport the following morning and ran to a local Boots store where she told staff she had been raped.\nPolice arrested Harding the same day and he was taken to HMP Parc to await his trial.\nAround three weeks later, Ms Nesbitt-Marr received the first letter from Harding, sent via a fellow inmate.\nIn the letter, seen by the BBC, Harding said he missed the feel of her \"naked skin\" and said he wanted to be in a relationship with her when he \"gets out\".\nMs Nesbitt-Marr, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after Harding's violent attack, said it felt like he was handing her the letter himself.\n\"My mind just froze and I saw all of the events happening again,\" she said.\n\"It really did put me back in that moment.\"\nShe called Gwent Police, who gave her a crime reference number and suggested she contact the prison.\nThe prison told her to use a scheme, launched by the UK government in 2022, in which victims can ask for unwanted contact from prisoners to be stopped. \nMs Nesbitt-Marr did this, but the letters continued.\nIn total, she said she received seven letters, both before and after Harding's trial and conviction last year. \nHarding was found guilty in December of six counts including false imprisonment and rape against Ms Nesbitt-Marr.\nIn the same trial, he was also found guilty of four counts against a 16-year-old victim, including false imprisonment, strangulation and threats to kill.\nHe was jailed for 15 years and given a restraining order banning him from contacting Ms Nesbitt-Marr directly or through third parties, but the letters continued.\nEventually, she shared her story on TikTok.\nThe videos had hundreds of thousands of views and women messaged her to say they had experienced similar problems.\nBut months on, Ms Nesbitt-Marr said the privately-run prison had still not reached out to her or apologised, leaving her \"completely in the dark\".\nMs Nesbitt-Marr's dad, Paul, worked in prisons for 20 years.\nHe said preventing letters reaching victims was a \"basic\" part of a prison's duty to keep members of the public safe.\nAfter Harding sent a second letter to his daughter, he said he called the prison to explain the situation.\nHe said: \"I explained that my understanding was that the security manager should be briefing the staff who deal with post and telling them that no correspondence with the victim's name and address should be leaving the establishment, under any circumstances.\"\nHe said he was assured that would happen, but it did not.\n\"It makes me feel extremely angry,\" he added.\n\"When I was working in prisons, this would be one of the most basic duties.\"\nG4S, which runs HMP Parc, said it had taken \"all appropriate steps\" but acknowledged it had not been able to stop the letters.\nIt said it had taken action, including disciplining Harding and two other inmates, and reporting the letters to police.\nBut it said Harding \"chose to breach his restraining order by using third parties\".\nThe spokesperson added: \"We appreciate that these letters would have caused immense distress and express our sympathies to Ms Nesbitt-Marr.\"\nGwent Police said it was investigating the letters.\nViolence against women and girls campaigner Ellie Wilson, who waived her right to anonymity as a rape survivor to campaign for more support, praised Ms Nesbitt-Marr for speaking out and said survivors were treated as an \"afterthought\" by the justice system.\nMs Wilson's attacker, Daniel MacFarlane, was found guilty of two rape charges and sentenced to five years in prison in July 2022, after she gave police an audio recording of him confessing to raping her.\nShe has since successfully campaigned for a pilot scheme in Scotland to give victims free access to court transcripts.\nSpeaking about Ms Nesbitt-Marr's experience, she said: \"It's awful to hear what she's gone through, both at the hands of her perpetrator, but also at the hands of the system. \n\"We need to make sure that the justice system properly supports survivors, and ensures that justice is actually delivered.\"\nSara Kirkpatrick of Welsh Women's Aid said Ms Nesbit",
    "Taylor Swift fans came out in force on Vienna's streets to sing her songs and show their defiance, a day after her concerts there were cancelled because of a plot to attack them.\nHundreds of Swifties staged an impromptu open-air gathering to overcome the disappointment of not seeing the US superstar on her record-breaking Eras tour.\nThey also said they understood the decision to cancel the stadium shows on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and were grateful to the police.\nAustrian authorities said they had foiled a plan by a supporter of the Islamic State group to carry out a suicide attack.\nOne British fan called Becky said she felt \"sombre but also excited by the atmosphere\" on Corneliusgasse, a road whose name resembles Cornelia Street in New York, after which Swift named a song.\n\"It's a really strange situation and I think the ultimate thing we feel is just grateful that we're safe and that everyone else is safe,\" she told BBC News. \"A bit of a mixed bag of emotions.\"\nShe said the cancellation made her feel \"probably the most disappointed about anything I've ever been in my life\", but she agreed the decision had been made \"for the right reasons\".\nShe was one of almost 200,000 fans who were due to attend the three concerts.\nOthers included Jessica Holroyd, who had flown to the city from Bristol.\n\"I found out the news when I was in the airport, and I had a bit of a cry in the airport toilets,\" she said.\n\"It's all quite emotional. I've been a fan since I was 15 and I'm 32 soon, so it's just quite devastating, really.\"\nMs Holroyd said the gigs were \"such a momentous occasion for loads of people\".\n\"It feels like it might be the only opportunity to see her, particularly the Eras tour, so it just feels like a huge loss.\"\nHowever, she said she thought Austrian police had \"handled it really well\".\n\"And as sad as it is, it seems like the best decision for everyone's safety - the fans and the crew and Taylor, of course. It's not worth the loss of life.\"\nFans also traded friendship bracelets, some restaurants and coffee shops gave away free food and drink, several museums offered free admission, and a church opened its doors and played Swift songs all day.\n\"The way Vienna is responding to this and embracing Swifties is so, so, so incredibly beautiful,\" wrote one fan on X.\n\"I know it doesn\u2019t erase the sadness and fear from having the concerts cancelled for the reason they were cancelled, but by God is it a rainbow amidst this nasty storm.\"\nNatascha Strobl, an Austrian political scientist and author, was planning to go to two of the three gigs, and said she was \"absolutely devastated\" they were cancelled.\n\"I was looking forward to it for over a year, and made bracelets and planned outfits and planned the whole day,\" she told BBC News.\n\"There are people sitting in hotel rooms who don't know what to do, people who are supposed to fly over who don't know what to do now. They're in shock. There's a lot of crying, of course.\"\nBut she agreed that there could be \"no debate when it comes to security\".\n\"If it's not safe, it's not safe,\" she said, explaining that no-one could risk the prospect of a repeat of previous \"devastating and shocking\" atrocities like at Manchester Arena, when 22 people were killed in a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in 2017.\nLast week, three young girls were killed in a knife attack on a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport.\n\"Of course, safety is paramount,\" Ms Strobl said. \"But still, we're allowed to feel absolutely terrible about it.\"\nTwo suspects, aged 19 and 17, have been arrested.\nThe head of Austria's domestic intelligence service, Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, told a news conference the 19-year-old had planned to carry out an attack using explosives and knives.\n\"We have seized these weapons and he considered either possibility and his goal was to kill himself and a large number of people either today or tomorrow at the concert,\" Mr Haijawi-Pirchner said.\nAustrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said: \"The situation was serious, but a tragedy had been prevented.\"\nSwift said in a 2019 interview that an attack on one of her gigs was \"her biggest fear\".\n\"After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting [also in 2017], I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn\u2019t know how we were going to keep three million fans safe over seven months,\" she told Elle at the time.\n\"There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.\"\nShe has not yet commented on the Austrian plot and cancellations.\nThe next concerts in the singer's schedule are in London, with five nights at Wembley Stadium from next Thursday.\nA spokesman for the city's Metropolitan Police said it worked \"closely with venue security teams and other partners to ensure there are appropriate security and policing plans in place\".\nThey added: \"There is nothing to indicate that the matters being investigated by the Austrian authorities will have an impact on upc",
    "A couple say they are \"often afraid to cuddle\" their two-year-old son due to a group of genetic conditions that cause his skin to break and blister with minimal contact.\nDaniel and Sarah Statham say their son Leo has the \"most severe\" form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa (EB), an incurable condition that causes many babies to die within their first two years of life.\nThe couple, from Hinckley in Leicestershire, said they were given a prognosis of two years for their son, and are taking things day by day.\n\"His condition is so painful, and Leo doesn't understand,\" Mrs Statham said.\nYoung people with EB are sometimes called \"butterfly children\", due to their skin's fragility, like a butterfly's wing.\nLeo is being treated at Birmingham Children's Hospital, which has a specialist EB service.\nAnd his parents have found support from Loughborough-based Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People - a charity currently appealing for funds to continue providing its services.\nMrs Statham, 32, said: \"Just normal daily life is a minefield of dangers for Leo.\n\"We have to be so careful even picking him up and holding him.\n\"If he is lifted under his arms, that can shed his skin and cause open wounds.\"\nThere is currently no cure for the condition, or an effective treatment to prevent the skin problems caused by EB, according to the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children.\nIn severe cases of EB such as Leo's, blisters become widespread, and blistered areas develop into wounds that can be difficult to heal.\nLeo's parents said they had to be at his side constantly, as he could have flare-ups every 20 minutes.\nMr Statham, 35, added: \"The prognosis was two years. He's hit two years, but we've been told we've got to take it day by day.\"\nAlthough his parents said Leo had defied expectations of doctors when he was diagnosed, they \"still live in fear\".\nMrs Statham added: \u201cEvery time he closes his eyes, he is at risk. He has had corneal abrasions three times in his little life; once he couldn't open his eyes for two weeks.\" \nThe pair said Rainbows had been \"absolutely phenomenal\" since their son's diagnosis.\n\"In a life where we have nothing but uncertainty, we take solace at Rainbows,\" Mrs Statham said.\n\"There are parents who are in similar situations with poorly children, who just get it. We feel we have so much support there.\n\"We can just get a coffee and talk to supportive people, while knowing Leo is safe and cared for.\n\"We don't know our future and we all want to protect Leo.

    "A man has said his young family have been left terrified after racist graffiti was daubed on their home in Ballykelly.\nShinu Mathew, who lives with his wife and two children, aged seven and four, told BBC News NI that they considered leaving the area following the incident but neighbours had persuaded them to stay.\nGraffiti was painted on three homes in Fort Drive and Forest Drive in the County Londonderry village between 03:00 and 04:00 BST on Tuesday.\nPolice said it was being treated as a hate crime.\nThose targeted included an elderly woman and another couple, a Sinn F\u00e9in councillor said. \nMr Mathew said he could not sleep the following evening after the graffiti appeared, fearing his home would be targeted again. \n\"When I hear a car pass at night I am always going  to the window to check,\" he said.\nMr Mathew said police assured him there would be an increased officer presence in the area following the incident.\nHe thanked his neighbours for being supportive and said his family was incredibly grateful for the kind people in their community. \n\"My neighbours came, brushed it, cleaned it, washed it, they then told us if we need anything or if something happens again then to call them and they will come,\" he said. \n\"We were planning to move, but the neighbours said they give support to us, and after that we wanted to stay.\"\nOne neighbour, who did not want to give their name, said they were disgusted by what happened to the family, describing it as \"totally outrageous\". \n\"They are a lovely family and the weans [wee ones] all play together,\" the neighbour said. \n\"There was about 20 of us out with thinners and bleach trying to clean it [the graffiti] all up for them.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in councillor Dermot Nicholl condemned the attacks and said the whole community was shocked.\nHe praised neighbours who rallied around to help.\n\"It's not nice for anyone and these types of attacks aren't warranted at all,\" Mr Nicholl said. \n\"Ballykelly is a small commuter village, it is a relatively quiet area and people have been really shocked by this.\"\n\"I don\u2019t understand this \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make any sense - it's not warranted and not needed,\" Mr Nicholl said.\n\"People from different cultures all live in this area, they contribute to this community and have a right to live here.\"",
    "Victims of a prolific paedophile say they feel \"failed\" by the legal system after he died before spending a day in prison.\nBernard Rapley, 79, from Aldershot, was found guilty of 26 child sex crimes following a trial in January.\nHe was bailed but failed to attend two subsequent sentencing hearings and died before a third hearing.\nThe Judiciary, which is responsible for upholding the law and for bail and warrant decisions, said it is not able to comment on individual cases.\nRapley, who was known as Bob, was convicted of offences that occurred between 1988 and 2020, including child sexual assault and assault by penetration.\nHe was arrested in 2020 after one of his youngest victims, in tears, \"blurted\" out she was being abused. Others then came forward and also reported him to the police.\nThe BBC has spoken to a group of women who were abused by Rapley when they were children, and who are entitled to lifelong anonymity. \nThey all described feeling \"massive relief\" after the guilty verdicts at the end of Rapley's trial at Winchester Crown Court. \nBut they said what happened next felt \"like a kick in the gut\". \nThey were stunned when he was allowed home on bail again before being sentenced, and feared \"bumping into him\". \nOne woman, who the BBC is calling Lucy, said: \"On what planet is it acceptable to allow someone who's been convicted to this extent of child sex offences, to walk the streets?\n\"I felt at that point he's not going to see the inside of a prison cell because I knew he'd try and kill himself, because he'd said it to people.\"\nRapley was ordered to wear an electronic tag, obey a night-time home curfew, and not contact any of his victims.\nHe failed to attend two subsequent sentencing hearings, claiming illness.\nThen, immediately before a third court hearing in May, when a judge was due to decide whether to issue a warrant for his arrest, he died.\nLucy said she repeatedly warned the police he might take his own life, including in the hours before his death.  \nShe said someone who knew him told a relative he was intending to \"make himself ill again\", because he didn't want to go to prison. \nThe BBC has seen doorbell video footage backing up her claims.\nThe video was forwarded to the police and Lucy alerted the Crown Prosecution Service's barrister, but said she was told \"nothing\" could be done.\nThe next day the police called Lucy to say Rapley was dead.\n\"I just burst into tears, because it was all for nothing. I said 'we told you he was going to do this, we told you time and time again',\" she said.\nHampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary said Rapley's death did not appear to be suspicious. But Lucy wants an inquest to establish if he deliberately ended his life.\nAfter enduring the emotional trauma of a lengthy investigation and trial, the women said Rapley's death robbed them of the chance to read their victim impact statements in court.\nOne of his youngest victims described the devastating consequences of his abuse: \"It's something that's lurking, like the devil's always on your shoulder reminding you of what he's done to you.\n\"I feel failed. I just want justice - that he's named and shamed.\"\nThe women fear Rapley may have abused others who are yet to come forward, as they believe many people \"idolised\" him.\nOne added: \u201cPredators don\u2019t get caught out because they go around pretending to be this good person and that\u2019s how he got away with it for so long.\u201d\nLucy wants the legal process speeded up, as she often felt the case was \"sat on the back burner\u201d and she had to keep asking for updates.\nShe added: \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to talk about any aspect of the case with anyone at all until after the trial, so I couldn\u2019t have counselling. It was horrendous.\u201d\nHampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary said in a statement it knew Rapley had \"some serious health conditions\".\nIt said officers had been made aware of information relayed to the victims about Rapley the day before the May hearing, and it was \"being reviewed\" by the investigation team when he died the same day.\nIt added it understood the \"frustration and disappointment\" of his victims.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service said it hoped Rapley's convictions went \"some way towards providing closure on these awful crimes\", adding it is working hard with the courts to speed up the legal process and improve support for victims. \nAccording to Hampshire Coroner's Service, Rapley's death is \"still under investigation\" and any potential inquest is yet to be opened.\nIf you are affected by issues raised in this article help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Bus passengers in north London may experience disruption to their journeys after the sudden and indefinite withdrawal of eight Transport for London (TfL) services.\nSullivan buses, which runs the 217, 298, 299, 327, 389, 399, 549 and W9 bus routes, said it \"reluctantly\" took the decision to stop operating them.\nIn a statement it said \"pressures on TfL's funding\" had a \"direct impact\" on its ability to run the services.\nTfL said it was \"working hard to provide alternative travel options for people in the north London area\".\nSullivan said the closure would affect about 230 staff based at its South Mimms deport in Hertfordshire either indirectly or directly employed on the TfL services.\nIn a post on X, Sullivan Buses highlighted issues with TfL funding and the prospect of making cuts as reasons behind its decision, saying the remuneration for providing TfL's services had \"not kept pace with the increasing costs of service delivery\".\n\"We have decided that we can no longer sustain the further cuts necessary to meet the decreasing income received from TfL,\" the statement continued.\n\"Any inevitable reduction in funding will lead to a further decline in performance and this is not something we are willing to support.\"\nSullivan said the move came after failed bids to renew its contracts.\nThe bus operator added that at a meeting with TfL in June, it was \"unable to agree a way forward\" with TfL and that the transport authority had requested \"a date for our business to hand back all contracts\".\nSullivan also said that at the time of the meeting, TfL owed it more than \u00a3130,000 which TfL had initially offered to repay \"in instalments\".\n\"This is a considerable sum of money far a small business and the lack of these funds have undoubtedly impacted upon our ability to deliver the contracted services,\" it added.\nOne woman said she was worried for her grandmother who uses the bus to get to the high street, but \"doesn't speak the best English\" and would find the changes \"confusing\".\nThe woman, who wanted to comment anonymously, said although there were problems with wait times before the services were withdrawn, they provided a vital service for children going to school and in areas where \"there is no other pedestrian way to cross the motorway\" and get around Hertfordshire.\nShe added \"a lot of people want clarity\" including knowing how reliable any interim service would be, and \"a guarantee there won't be extra price increases from other operators\".\nTfL did not comment on the financial claims made by Sullivan Buses.\nRosie Trew, head of bus service delivery for TfL, said: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for any disruption caused to people\u2019s journeys due to the withdrawal of the bus operator, Sullivan Buses. \n\"We are working hard to provide alternative travel options for people in the north London area with eight bus routes affected. \n\"We encourage those who are affected to plan ahead, allow extra time for their journeys and check before they travel using our website or the TfL Go app.\u201d\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "For two weeks, the world has come to play in Paris. One of the planet's most stunning cities has played host to the \"cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\" of Olympic royalty. \nNational leaders and celebrities have joined the sports stars to strut their stuff, their every move beamed across the globe by the broadcasters gathered here. \nBut as the athletes like to say, it is often the fans who really complete the Games.\nThat has been all the more true in 2024, with spectators allowed to return to the Olympics en masse for the first time since Covid struck.\nThey have not been awarded medals, but with their quirky displays of passion, patriotism and downright peculiarity, they have provided plenty of highlights.\nHere are five of the most memorable sights from the French capital that you probably won't have seen on TV.\nLamp posts, cycle stands, bins, post boxes: it seemed there was no piece of street furniture that spectators were unwilling to climb to catch sight of the action.\nIt was the first Saturday of sport, and many Parisians were starting to warm to the Games. The cycling time-trial contests were unfolding along some of the city's most beautiful boulevards - and big crowds were beginning to gather. \nThe most acrobatic - or foolhardy - spectators started scaling any available object to get a better view - performing feats of acrobatics not seen until the Games's official climbing contest began a week or so later.  \nThe sight of residents dangling precariously out of their windows left you wondering what George-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, the man who carefully rebuilt Paris in the 19th Century, would make of it all.\nA legion of picture-takers lined up to get their photos taken with \"Asterix and Obelix\" after a judo final in the nearby Champ de Mars Arena. \nIf there was a gold for fancy-dress, the French pair would have been in serious contention thanks to their depictions of the legendary comic-book Gaulish warriors.\nThe two men - real names Sebastian and Thomas-Felix - said the Games were showcasing French culture and bringing people together in a party atmosphere. At least everyone could \"cry together\" after losing the men's 60kg judo final, they said.\nParis might be known for high fashion, but some of the fortnight's other head-turning looks have included an Egyptian pharaoh costume, various national dresses and headwear inspired by the Games's smiling red-cap mascots. \nThere was also this man:\n\nSome of the most rousing renditions of the French national anthem heard in Paris have not been in the sporting arenas, but have instead been spontaneous singalongs by wandering French fans draped in their tricolore flags.\nA version of La Marseillaise belted out on a busy metro train after the opening ceremony surpassed the more mumbly performance heard in the rain-soaked stands of the Trocad\u00e9ro during the official event.\nThe chanting seemed to encapsulate a nation's relief that the ceremony had been pulled off successfully after so many worries about security and organisation.\nLater in the Games, social media users observed a perfect pun could be achieved by substituting the tune's marching line with the surname of France's most decorated athlete in Paris.\n\"Marchons! Oui, marchons!\" is the original. The alternative references swimming sensation L\u00e9on Marchand: \"Marchand! Oui, Marchand!\" Expect to hear it at the next Olympics in 2028.\nThe coin-operated telescopes found 115m (380ft) up the Eiffel Tower are typically used by tourists to marvel at some of Paris's other top sights, such as the details on the faraway Arc de Triomphe or the Notre-Dame cathedral. \nBut the city's world-famous monuments have felt quieter than normal, briefly outshone by exhilarating spectacles of sporting endeavour. \nOn a woozy Monday afternoon, those sightseers who had assembled on the tower's second-floor viewing platform discovered a clever ruse: the telescopes could be used to spy on a beach volleyball match happening down below.\nIt was possible to witness a thrilling comeback for Spain's women over the Netherlands. It was just one creative way curious bystanders managed to get a glimpse of the sporting action, with all but the priciest tickets often sold out.\nMany of the Games's volunteers have had a ball in Paris, if the gleeful dancing by a troupe near the Stade de France on one balmy night is anything to go by. \nStanding on the concourse of a nearby railway station, the group pulled off a well-choreographed routine to Toto's Africa - all the while waggling their giant foam fingers as they directed punters to the platforms below with megaphones.  \nSome 45,000 people are said by organisers to have given up their time to help deliver the Olympics and Paralympics - herding people around metro stops, attending to athletes, and chaperoning others around bewildering security cordons. They have even been photographed spraying fans with water to cool them down.\nIn their distinctive turquoise and pink garb, they have frequently been the Games's unsung heroes, and could ",
    "People are being urged to take precautions and avoid parts of the canal network following a toxic chemical spillage in Walsall.\nSodium cyanide, which can cause seizures and vomiting, was confirmed as the leaked substance as a major incident was declared on Tuesday.\nAnochrome Ltd, which deals in surface coatings and sealing, said a \"chemical incident\" regrettably released chemicals into the Walsall waterway during the early hours of Monday.\nThe public have been advised to stay away from a 12-mile stretch of water and towpaths in the West Midlands.\nThe affected area runs from the middle of the borough to Birmingham, as well as interconnected waterways in Wednesbury, Tipton and West Bromwich.\nPeople have been warned to avoid an extended area of the canal and towpaths from the Walsall lock flight to the lock flights at Rushall/Ryders Green and Perry Barr.\nAnochrome Ltd, a metal finishing company, said it could confirm \"a chemical incident\" occurred at its Walsall site during the early hours of Monday.\n\"Regrettably, as a result, some of the released chemicals entered a canal in Walsall,\" it added.\nThe firm said it had immediately notified the Environment Agency (EA) and Severn Trent Water and it had made all its facilities available to the authorities, including laboratory testing areas.\n\"The safety of our community and the environment is our top priority. We are focused on limiting the impact of this incident and will provide further updates as they become available,\" it added.\nSpeaking to BBC Midlands Today, the EA's Marc Lidderth said Anochrome Ltd, which describes itself as an \"environmentally aware organisation\" on its website, was regulated by the EA.\nHe said sodium hydroxide and \"possibly zinc\" were also thought to have entered the canal and called the incident \"unacceptable\".\nThe Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said it was monitoring the situation. \nMinisters were receiving regular updates, it added.\nThe chemical sodium cyanide is a white, crystal-like solid with a faint almond odour.\nIt is used in industry for metal cleaning, plating and extraction.\nWhen cyanide salts are ingested they release cyanide in the body - they can also be absorbed through the skin.\nSymptoms may be delayed for two to four hours if ingested on a full stomach.\nExposure to cyanide can cause symptoms including headaches, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness, seizures, vomiting and low blood pressure.\nIn the most serious cases, there can be heart and breathing problems or even death.\n(Source: UK Health Security Agency)\nSodium cyanide is a poisonous compound.\nThe chemical dissolves in water and could have serious adverse health effects if people or pets come into direct contact with it, Walsall Council said.\nIt can be rapidly fatal if high concentrations are inhaled or ingested as it interferes with the body's ability to process oxygen.\nThere was a potential serious risk to health if people or their pets come into contact with water in the affected stretch of the canal, a spokesperson for the local authority said.\nIf the chemical comes into contact with the eyes, it can cause watering, pain, redness, swelling and sensitivity to light.\nBoth sodium and potassium cyanide can react with acid, acid salts and nitrates, the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) said.\nThe UKHSA advises those who have health concerns regarding exposure to sodium cyanide to seek medical attention.\nChildren who are exposed to the chemical are likely to experience similar symptoms to those seen in exposed adults.\nAnyone who has had direct physical contact with the stretch of water and is feeling unwell has been advised to call 111 or 999 if it is an emergency.\nMultiple agencies including the West Midlands police, fire and ambulance services, the Canal and River Trust, Severn Trent Water, UKHSA, Walsall and Sandwell councils and the Environment Agency are responding to the incident.\nWalsall Council's interim director of public health, Nadia Inglis, previously said: \"Our primary aim has been to keep the public safe and to protect their health and wellbeing.\n\"Given the nature of the substance, we\u2019re taking a cautious approach to protecting our public until we know it\u2019s safe to open those canal towpaths again.\u201d\nThe Canal and River Trust said people living on boats on the canal in the affected area had been made aware of the spill.\nIn an earlier statement, Walsall Council urged those who had taken fish from the canal not to eat it.\nDrinking water was not affected by this incident, it added.\nCouncil leader Gary Perry said on Tuesday it was too early to speculate how the substance had entered the waterway but promised regular updates.\n\"Our priority is the safety of our residents. I share their concerns and hope to see this incident resolved as soon as possible,\" he added.\n\"For your own safety please avoid this area of the canal and its towpaths.\u201d\n\nA number of dead fish have been spotted in the canal following the spill.\nDr Delia Garratt, ch",
    "When comedian John Tothill set his sights on performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, he knew he would have to take radical action to afford the eye-watering upfront costs. \nLured by the prospect of boosting his savings, he signed up for a medical trial that would see him infected with malaria - a deadly disease that causes about 600,000 deaths annually around the world. \nIt led to a few days of fever, painful joints and hallucinations - which he was lucky enough to have cured in a controlled environment with medication.\nThe whole process helped fund his festival debut as a stand-up.\n\"I got paid about \u00a32,500 all in and if I'm honest with you, I would have done it for less,\" he told BBC Scotland News. \nThe malaria medical trial gave him the cash to set up his solo show at Edinburgh in 2023.\nAnd he has returned to his experience of contracting the disease to provide the material for his 2024 run.  \nHe \"really, really\" loves Edinburgh in August and is still prepared to make huge sacrifices to indulge his love of performing to festival crowds. \n\"What's so bad is if it was even more expensive, I'd still come and do it and I would just go on another malaria trial,\" the 27-year-old said. \n\"I probably shouldn't have had to have got a [life-threatening] disease in order to come and do this, but I don't regret it, you know.\"\nJohn saved money for his first solo Edinburgh show from a series of jobs, including as a teaching assistant and a bag packer in a coffee factory. \nBut he knew he still needed a big injection of cash and signed up for the malaria trial investigating how the body reacts in the early stage of infection. \n\"They said to me that the reason the trial is well paid isn't really because it's that risky, it's because it sounds frightening,\" he said. \n\"It's a disease that everyone's heard of, and obviously it's still one of the biggest killers in the world.\"\nMalaria is spread by mosquitoes and is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable but it caused an estimated 608,000 deaths in 2022, according to the World Health Organisation. \nMedics told him they would infect him with a tiny amount of the disease, and once he developed symptoms they would treat him with effective medication. \nTwo weeks later he began feeling very sick over the course of about an hour. \n\"It was definitely the sickest I'd ever felt,\" he said. \nHe was kept under close observation in a medical facility while he experienced a fever, difficulty in sleeping and concentrating, and a \"panging pain\" in his fingers and joints. \n\"And then when my temperature got a bit higher,  I had these nightmares which turned into waking hallucinations,\" said John, who lives in London. \n\"At one point I thought that there was a devil in my room that was dragging me into hell or something, which wasn't ideal at all.\"\nAfter four days, the medication kicked in and he quickly started to feel better. \n\"The really, really, really strange thing about it was how much the physical pain of the malaria was actually very offset by the certainty of knowing exactly what was wrong with me, knowing exactly what the timetable was, and the doctors knew exactly what was wrong with me,\" he said. \nHis fee covered the upfront costs of his 2023 Edinburgh show, which cost about \u00a39,000 in total. \nThat paid for accommodation, venue hire, marketing materials and PR, and fees for the producer and director. \nHe managed to break even, meaning he had the funds to return this year with Thank God This Lasts Forever at the Pleasance Courtyard Beside. \n\"It's about my malaria trial and what I feel it taught me and most of all, I think it's about the prioritising your pleasure in life over anything like a career or any kind of precious notion of time-keeping or that sort of thing. \n\"It was a huge privilege to be in a situation where I was never made to feel afraid of what might happen because I knew exactly what was wrong with me, and I think that affected the way I view time, which sounds quite lofty but is explained across the course of an hour-long show.\"\nAs an up-and-coming stand-up, he knows it's important to appear in Edinburgh to have any hope of making comedy a full time career.\nThe success of Netflix hit Baby Reindeer - a series based on Richard Gadd's 2019 Edinburgh show - proves the investment can be worth it. \n\"It's the one place you know you stand a chance of being seen [by TV producers and commissioners].\n\"It's also the place where more public will see you than in London, because the infrastructure is there of tourists coming to see comedy.\n\"But the spiralling costs of the Fringe are pricing some performers - like Richard Herring and Gail Porter - out of the market. Jason Manford has said he will make a financial loss this year. \nJohn points out that going to the Edinburgh Fringe \"isn't a human right\" but it's up to local government policy makers to make accommodation more affordable. \n\"I'm sure that's doable and what I would say is if this was a sport even",
    "The leader of the Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah has said the response to the Israeli assassination of a senior commander in Beirut is coming.\nSpeaking in a televised speech to mark one week since Fuad Shukr\u2019s killing, Hassan Nasrallah said the retaliation would be \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d, and that the assassination could not be treated as an ordinary attack.\nHe added that the group might act alone or in co-ordination with other Iranian-supported factions in the region.\nCountries around the world have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon in recent days, amid concerns that a possible attack from the heavily armed Hezbollah on Israel could lead to a wider war between the two sides.\nIran has also vowed to retaliate following the assassination of the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran last week. Both Hamas and Iran blame Israel, which has not commented.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, low-flying Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier above Beirut, in the minutes before Nasrallah was due to begin his speech.\nNasrallah, who spoke for more than an hour and a half, said that the sonic booms were intended to provoke those who had gathered to listen to him. \nEarlier on Tuesday, Israel said it had carried out an air strike against what it said was a \"military structure\" used by Hezbollah, the militia and political movement, in southern Lebanon.\nFour people were killed in the strike on a house in the town of Maifadoun, around 19 miles (30km) from the Israeli border, the Lebanese health ministry said.\nThe four men were Hezbollah fighters, security sources told the AFP news agency. In an apparent response, the group launched drone strikes on towns in northern Israel, injuring two people.\nSeveral countries, including the US, have urged citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. The country's foreign minister said on Tuesday that he was working to ensure that Hezbollah did not trigger a major escalation with its response to Shukr's death.\nThe Israeli attack on Maifadoun was carried out by fighter jets, and was guided by intelligence agencies, the Israeli Defense Forces said in a statement posted to social media. Officers from the internal security agency Shin Bet and military intelligence agency Aman provided assistance to the military.\nIn response, Hezbollah fired what it called a \"swarm\" of drones at Israel, injuring two people in the northern town of Mazra\u2019a. But a source in the group told the Reuters news agency that the attack was not part of its response to the death of Shukr.\nUS President Joe Biden met his senior national security team on Monday as concerns of a retaliatory attack on Israel grew.\nMr Biden said he had been briefed on preparations to support Israel, should it be attacked, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken said officials were working \"around the clock\" to prevent an escalation.\nThe United Nations' rights chief Volker Turk called on \"all parties, along with those states with influence, to act urgently to de-escalate what has become a very precarious situation\".\nElsewhere,  several US military personnel have been injured  in a strike on a base in Iraq. The rocket fire on the Ain al-Assed base is the latest in a series of attacks on the facility, which hosts American forces fighting the Islamic State group.",
    "A pilot who died after they crashed a stolen helicopter into a hotel in Australia had attended a party with staff members the night before, their employer has said. \nThe helicopter belonged to Queensland-based helicopter tour agency Nautilus Aviation who said the employee had been celebrating at a private send-off with colleagues hours before the crash. \nNautilus added that the individual was licensed to fly helicopters in New Zealand but had never flown in Australia.\nThe pilot was killed in the accident, while two hotel guests were taken to hospital in a stable condition. \nIn a statement to the BBC, Nautilus said the individual had recently been promoted to a \"ground crew position\" at another of the company's bases.\nOn Sunday night, the pilot joined colleagues at a private send-off, which was also attended by off-duty pilots. Nautilus clarified that this was \"not a work event and was coordinated by friends\". \nNautilus added that the individual later gained \u201cunauthorised access to our helicopter hangar\".\nThe helicopter hit the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in the northern Queensland city of Cairns at around 01:50 local time on Monday (16:50 BST Sunday), sparking a fire and forcing the evacuation of about 400 guests.\nAuthorities say the only occupant of the helicopter died at the scene, and two hotel guests - a man in his 80s and a woman in her 70s \u2013 were taken to hospital in a stable condition.\nAmanda Kay, who was staying in the hotel on the main esplanade in Cairns, described seeing a helicopter flying \"extra low\", without lights in rainy weather.\n\"[It] has turned round and hit the building,\" she said, adding that the aircraft \"blew up\".\nAnother bystander said she saw the helicopter fly past the hotel twice in the moments before the collision.\n\"Boy that was going fast, that helicopter. Unbelievable,\" a woman said, in video showing the fiery aftermath of the crash.\n\"It was just going out of control, that thing was.\"\nTwo of the helicopter's rotor blades came off on impact, landing on the esplanade and in the hotel pool, according to Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS).\nNautilus Aviation said in its statement that it had completed interviews with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and the Queensland Police Service (QPS), and had cooperated with full transparency on its disclosure of the events leading up to and following the incident.\n\u201cWe offer our heartfelt condolences to the individual\u2019s family and all who have been affected by this tragedy and continue to offer our support to our employees during this very challenging period,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cWe will continue to work very closely with QPS and the ATSB as they investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident.\u201d\nLocated in northern Queensland, the city of Cairns is a popular tourist destination due to its proximity to the Great Barrier Reef.",
    "A Russian court has sentenced amateur ballerina Ksenia Karelina to 12 years in jail for treason for donating $51 (\u00a339) to a charity supporting Ukraine.\nKarelina, who has American and Russian citizenship, pleaded guilty last week after a trial held behind closed doors.\nShe had been living in Los Angeles and became a US citizen in 2021. She was arrested during a family visit last January in Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow.\nProsecutors had sought a 15-year jail term. The court in Yekaterinburg found her guilty of high treason and sentenced her to imprisonment in a general regime penal colony.\nKarelina had been accused by Russia's FSB security service of raising money for a Ukrainian organisation providing arms to the Ukrainian military. \nRussian human rights activists said while living in the US she had made a single transfer of $51.80 on the first day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 22 February 2022. The FSB is thought to have discovered the transaction on her phone.\nHer lawyer, Mikhail Mushailov, said Karelina had only admitted transferring the money and believed the funds would help victims on both sides. He told Russian media she would appeal against the sentence.\nThe charity, Razom for Ukraine, said earlier this year it was \"appalled\" to hear of the amateur ballerina's arrest and denied raising money for weapons or ammunition. It said it was a US-founded charity focused on humanitarian aid and disaster relief.\nKarelina went on trial in June in the same court as Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was jailed for espionage but freed earlier this month as part of a major prisoner swap with the US and other Western countries.\nThe cases in Yekaterinburg were heard by the same judge, Andrei Mineev.\nKsenia Karelina's boyfriend, boxer Chris van Heerden, said on Thursday that he was very angry with the US State Department.\n\"I woke up to the news this morning. I'm still sitting here processing what's happening,\" he told CBS News, the BBC's media partner. \n\"There was a prisoner swap two weeks ago, and Ksenia was not on that list,\" he said, adding that he had been pushing for her to be sent home for the past eight months.\n\"Ksenia should be home, and I'm angry, and I'm trying to hold my composure.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC's Newshour, Mr Van Heerden said he felt Karelina should never have gone back to Russia at the start of the year.\n\"Now my question is, can we get Ksenia declared 'wrongly detained' today, so that when the next swap happens, she is part of it?\"\nIf the US declares a person to be \"wrongfully detained\", it means it views them as a political hostage and negotiations are vital to securing their freedom.\nHe added \"To my surprise, there were two people [in the prisoner swap] who were not declared 'wrongly detained' and they got out - so why is Ksenia not home?\"\nSince the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia's authorities have clamped down on dissent and human rights groups say more than 1,000 criminal cases have been opened against anti-war dissidents.\nLast year President Vladimir Putin signed a decree formally increasing the maximum jail term for treason from 20 years to life. A record number of treason cases were opened last year, according to human rights activists.\nIn July, dual German-Russian teenager Kevin Lik was given four years for treason. He was one of the 16 men and women freed by Russia as part of its prisoner exchange with the West.\nWhen Karelina was first detained, rights group Perviy Otdel said she had been accused of swearing in a public place. But her initial detention for \"petty hooliganism\" was then extended when the FSB accused her of treason.\nShe had been working at a hotel spa in Beverly Hills before her arrest and had travelled to Yekaterinburg to see her parents and her elderly grandmother.\nKarelina is her maiden name, and she is also known as Ksenia Khavana because she took her ex-husband's surname.\n \"I want to break down and cry and yell and lose my head, but I know I have to stay strong - and I need to keep fighting,\" Mr Van Heerden told the BBC.\nHe said he worried about the effect of Karelina's imprisonment on her health.\n\"She is a very soft person with a very kind heart and I'm afraid for her. I'm afraid that her kind heart will be stepped on and I know that she is fearful. \nI know she wants to break down and cry, but she is pretending to be strong.\"\n\"The fight doesn't end here,\" he added, \"the fight is now to get her back on US soil. Our only hope is the US government.\"",
    "What do monkeys, wolves, pelicans, goats, cats and elephants have in common?\nWe\u2019re not at a zoo - these are all animals that Banksy has painted around London this week.\nEach day, the elusive street artist has unveiled a new artwork in a different location in the capital, posting it on Instagram at 13:00 BST.\nBanksy, famous for his enigmatic, often powerful artworks, has chosen not to caption his animals online.\nHe also hasn't explained why they're all painted in the same black stencil style.\nAll his agent would tell the BBC was that there was \"no comment on the theme\", adding there \"may or may not\" be more animal paintings to follow.\nThis has left people to speculate about their meaning. \nJames Peak, presenter of the BBC\u2019s The Banksy Story, thinks the message behind the paintings is less obvious than some of his previous works.\n\"It\u2019s interesting that the meaning is more hidden than usual,\" he tells the BBC. \n\"There\u2019s often a message that is more clear and immediate in his work: maybe this time around he wants us to work it out for ourselves?\" \n\nPeak adds that Banksy's animals show his trademark use of negative space, saying he's \"using the built environment as part of the art\", for \"maximum impact from minimum effort\". \nPeak also explains that the silhouettes for most of the animals this week are plain black, \"with no adornments or shading\".\n\"The monkeys look like they\u2019re swinging from the bridge,\" he notes, \"the pelicans are nicking the fish from the fish shop.\"\nBanksy\u2019s work is often political.\nDuring Glastonbury, he set out a blow-up boat, filled with dummies in lifejackets, during a set from Bristol-based post-punk band Idles. It was controversial and the then Conservative home secretary James Cleverly called it \"vile\". \nBansky responded, saying: \"The real boat I fund, the MV Louise Michel rescued 17 unaccompanied children from the central Med last night. As punishment the Italian authorities have detained it - which seems vile and unacceptable to me.\"\nBut he's kept silent this time around.\nFan theories online have ranged from the goat being about the Israel-Gaza war to the animals being compared to far-right rioters across the UK. \nPeak also highlights \"other theories that all the animals are maybe threatened or near extinction\".\n\"The monkeys may be escaping gentrification and further development in the Brick Lane area. The elephants may be isolated and lonely,\" he said.\nThe goat could represent Palestinians losing their footing - or may suggest \"we may be distracted or preoccupied with the \u2018Greatest of All Time\u2019 and the Olympics - instead of big global issues\".\nThe Observer's arts correspondent, Vanessa Thorpe, has suggested Banksy is simply hoping the new works \"cheer people with a moment of unexpected amusement\", and demonstrate the \"human capacity for creative play, rather than for destruction and negativity\".\n\nBut what do people on the street think?\nAt 08:00 BST on Friday, Brick Lane is relatively quiet - the hum of tourists who usually descend for food, fashion and street art are nowhere to be seen yet.\nBut there are a few who take advantage of the lack of traffic, stopping in the middle of the street to take selfies and photos.\nThe three primates on a railway line have been associated with the three wise monkeys in the Japanese proverb - \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\". \nBut in Banksy's work, the monkeys are not covering their eyes, ears or mouths.\nA group of women are excited to see the artwork, and a passerby stops and offers to take their photo together.\nThey tell the BBC they love Banksy because of the mystery surrounding his identity (Banksy\u2019s identity has always remained a secret, though on The Banksy Story, a 2003 interview was unearthed, where the artist confirmed his name was Robbie).\n\"I love his work because it\u2019s secret, it\u2019s undercover, and it\u2019s always topical \u2013 it\u2019s not random,\" Caz says.\n\"I think it might be in relation to what\u2019s going on in the country at the moment,\u201d says Sally, \"a statement.\"\nAbout five minutes later, another man stops to take a photo on a professional camera \u2013 he says he\u2019s going on a tour of London to catch the artworks which have appeared so far. \nA couple of hours later, and it\u2019s slightly busier in Walthamstow, where the fifth Banksy turned up on Friday: two pelicans eating fish, on the side of a chip shop.\nIt wasn\u2019t officially announced on social media until 13:00, but the suspected work had been circulating online.\nWhen I arrived there was a small huddle of people, mainly TV reporters and excited locals who were asking each other if the work is real.\n\"It brings character to the area - I\u2019ve never seen people standing like this before,\" says Hather Ali, one of the people who asked if it was a legitimate Banksy.\nHe lives next door to the fish shop and says he is going to check his CCTV footage from the night before, to see if he can see the secretive artist in action. \nFollowing the first work in Richmond, media outlets published pictures of two men ",

    "The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) has admitted it made an \"error\" in cancelling an acclaimed pianist\u2019s performance due to comments he made on the Israel-Gaza war.\nOn Sunday, Jayson Gillham premiered a five-minute piece called Witness, written by composer Connor D\u2019Netto, which was dedicated to the journalists of Gaza.\nBefore starting the recital, Mr Gillham said Israel had killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists.\nThe MSO subsequently removed the British-Australian pianist from an upcoming concert on Thursday, saying he put them in a \"difficult situation\".\nNow the entire concert, due to be held at Melbourne Town Hall, has been cancelled due to safety concerns.\nThe MSO says they are trying to reschedule the performance.\nAt Sunday\u2019s concert, which was held at the Iwaki Auditorium in Melbourne, Jayson Gillham performed a range of other works, from Beethoven to Chopin. \nWitness was a last-minute addition, according to the MSO.\n\"The killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world,\" Mr Gillham claimed before starting to play Witness.\nIn an apologetic statement on Thursday, the MSO said \u201cWhile the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra maintains that a concert platform is not an appropriate stage for political comment, we acknowledge Jayson\u2019s concerns for those in the Middle East and elsewhere.\"\n\u201cWe recognise the strength of feelings of all parties on this matter and particularly acknowledge the dedication and commitment demonstrated by all our musicians and staff this week.\u201d\nMr Gillham has accepted the MSO\u2019s apology.\n\u201cI hold my relationship with the MSO, its players and audience with the highest regard and look forward to our continued working relationship in years to come,\u201d he said in a statement.\nHamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.\nThat attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war.\nNearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nAt least 113 of those were journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organisation that promotes press freedom.\nThe decision by the MSO and their subsequent apology have caused a stir on social media. High profile barrister Greg Barns said the cancellation was \u201ctruly appalling,\u201d later adding that \u201cart is often powerful because it\u2019s political\u201d.\nArts critic and former Sydney Symphony Orchestra chairman Leo Schofield said of the MSO\u2019s apology, \u201cNot before time.

    "A speeding Mercedes driver has been jailed for 10 years for causing the death of an Ecuadorian politician's daughter in London.\nPsychologist Vanessa Sagnay de la Bastida was crossing the road holding hands with her fianc\u00e9 Michael Williams as they walked home near Wandsworth Bridge, in  west London, on 16 March 2022.\nOctavian Cadar, 39, drove towards them at about 55mph, more than double the 20mph speed limit, causing the terrified couple to become separated as they fled.\nMs Sagnay, 27, who was known as Charlotte, was hit before she reached the pavement, causing her to somersault in the air and land on a railing and sign post.\nShe suffered a catastrophic head injury and died at the scene.\nCadar, of Bexley, south-east London, had accused the couple of causing the collision by \"messing about in the road\", only admitting later to jurors that was wrong.\nHe also claimed he was trying to avoid them but the court was told the accident would not have happened if he had been driving at 30mph.\nA jury deliberated for 42 minutes to find him guilty of causing Ms Sagnay's death by dangerous driving.\nCadar was jailed for 10 years and disqualified from driving for 10 years and eight months.\nIn 2018, he had been convicted of speeding, fined, and given six penalty points at Bromley Magistrates' Court.\nSpeaking at his sentencing, Mr Williams, who was studying for a PhD at University College London, said: \"No-one should have the power to kill just to drive fast.\n\"Cadar valued speeding in a sports car more than our lives. Afterwards he reacted with anger and blame.\n\"What was my worst nightmare is now my reality. At least in my nightmares I am with Charlotte again.\"\nOn his fianc\u00e9e, he said: \"My life with Charlotte was wonderful, she was the best friend I ever had.\n\"She had the magical ability to support people in just the way they needed.\"\nHe added: \"She was completely non-judgmental and fiercely, unflinchingly, fought for everyone to be treated fairly.\n\"Friendship like that made it feel easy for me to be myself, and my best self.\n\"How could I possibly explain who Charlotte was, what she meant to me, and everything that was lost when she was killed?\n\"She was half of me.

    "Mosques in at least four English cities were targeted in the recent far-right disorder - one was pelted with bricks, bottles and rocks.\nSeveral community groups sprang up in response. One of them is \u201cProtect\u201d, which deploys people to places of worship that are potentially under threat.\nWithin 48 hours of being set up, more than 1,500 people had signed up in the north-west of the country, where the group is based.\nProtect put out a call in Accrington on Wednesday, after a mosque asked for help - a viral video later showed pubgoers hugging some of the young men who had come to defend the building.\nThough the mood has become much calmer in recent days, those running the group say it will continue as a means of remaining vigilant.\nGiven concerns about how they would be perceived, organisers were initially reluctant to speak, but agreed to do so anonymously.\n\u201cThe group is there to notify each other of problems in our areas so we can tell people to be careful. But if they do come towards our places of worship, the community will come out and we protect those places,\u201d says the group\u2019s founder.\nHe says that communities were caught out by the scale and suddenness of the trouble, and fear it could return any time, so part of the group\u2019s function is to check the many rumours of further unrest to see if there is basis to them.\nBut when help is asked for by a mosque or community centre, he says the word will go out.\n\u201cWe will go there to defend, not with weapons, but just physically standing in front (of places). If anyone is attacking the mosque, we won't allow it,\u201d says Protect\u2019s founder.\n\u201cIf I've got family members inside that mosque and it's getting attacked, then by all means - even if I do get injured, by a brick or a firebomb or whatever it is - I\u2019ll protect them,\u201d he says.\nBut why not leave the protection of communities and mosques completely to the police?\n\u201cThe police are doing an amazing job, and they\u2019re trying their utmost to keep us safe, but they're already understaffed and they've got their hands full with these riots,\u201d the Protect founder says.\n\u201cWe've seen what happened in some other places, the police couldn't cover it, they weren't ready for it.  Somebody needs to be there just by having a presence with the police as well,\u201d adds one of those running the group.\nWe approached local police forces but they said they could not specifically comment on the group\u2019s actions.\nEarlier this week, in response to fears of threats to the mosque in Accrington, Lancashire Constabulary acknowledged concerns and promised they had a \u201crobust policing response in place to tackle possible disorder\u201d.\nThe founder of Protect says he had been unhappy at incidents, unrelated to the group, in Stoke-on-Trent and in Birmingham where Muslim men had shown up with weapons, saying it was a central rule of Protect that people neither turn up with weapons or with face coverings.\nHe, and many other Muslim groups, also condemned an attack on a man who was punched and kicked outside a pub in Birmingham.\n\u201cWe've not made (the group) to incite racial hatred or start riots, but to protect ourselves and be vigilant,\u201d says the Protect founder, who says creation of the group has been purely driven by the fear of further violence, particularly among Muslim women, some of whom have reported having headscarves pulled off or having faced abuse or assault.\n\u201cWe keep saying if there's a protest going on, don't go there. Don't be stupid. Let them protest. As long as they're not coming to our places to cause damage, don't put yourself where you don't need to be,\u201d he says.\nDuring the week we saw some of the group\u2019s rules in action. One evening Protect had made its members aware that a mosque in Accrington had put out a call for help because of concerns of violence.\nWe saw dozens of young men gathered outside the mosque. They were repeatedly told by organisers not to wear masks or balaclavas, there was no evidence of any weapons as they stood alongside police.\nIn fact, the evening passed off peacefully, with some of the evening\u2019s most viral video moments playing out in Accrington, as pubgoers came out to hug the young Muslim men as they walked away from the mosque when it was clear there would be no trouble.\nThe young men had been with the police throughout and had been chatting with officers.\n\u201cWe don't want war, and we're not asking for all this to happen,\u201d says Protect\u2019s founder.\n\u201cBut this country belongs to us as much to them. We were born here, our parents were born here. Some of our grandparents or great-grandparents fought in the World War II.\n\u201cSo I think we've got as much right as anybody else to call this country.\u201d",
    "Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed has resigned and left the country after weeks of student-led protests spiralled into deadly, nationwide unrest.\nThe 76-year-old fled in a helicopter on Monday to India, reports said, as thousands of protesters stormed her official residence in the capital Dhaka.\nThis brings an unexpected end to the reign of Bangladesh's longest-serving PM, who has been in power since 2009 and ruled the country for more than 20 years in total. \nCredited with overseeing the South Asian country's economic progress in recent years, Ms Hasina began her political career as a pro-democracy icon. \nHowever, in recent years she has been accused of turning autocratic and clamping down on any opposition to her rule. Politically-motivated arrests, disappearances, extra-judicial killings and other abuses have all risen under her rule. \nIn January she won an unprecedented fourth term as PM in a January election widely decried by critics as being a sham and boycotted by the main opposition. \nBorn to a Muslim family in East Bengal in 1947, Ms Hasina had politics in her blood.\nHer father was the nationalist leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's \"Father of the Nation\" who led the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971 and became its first president. \nAt that time, Ms Hasina had already established a reputation as a student leader at Dhaka University.\nHer father was assassinated with most of his family members in a military coup in 1975. Only Ms Hasina and her younger sister survived as they were travelling abroad at the time.\nAfter living in exile in India, Ms Hasina returned to Bangladesh in 1981 and became the leader of the political party her father belonged to, the Awami League. \nShe joined hands with other political parties to hold pro-democracy street protests during the military rule of General Hussain Muhammed Ershad. Propelled by the popular uprising, Ms Hasina quickly became a national icon.\nShe was first elected to power in 1996. She earned credit for signing a water-sharing deal with India and a peace deal with tribal insurgents in the south-east of the country.\nBut at the same time, her government was criticised for numerous allegedly corrupt business deals and for being too subservient to India.\nShe later lost to her former ally-turned-nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in 2001.\nAs heirs to political dynasties, both women dominated Bangladesh politics for more than three decades and used to be known as the \"battling begums\". Begum refers to a Muslim woman of high rank.\nObservers say their bitter rivalry resulted in bus bombs, disappearances and extrajudicial killings becoming regular occurrences.\nMs Hasina eventually came back to power in 2009 in polls held under a caretaker government.\nA true political survivor, she endured numerous arrests while in opposition as well as several assassination attempts, including one in 2004 that damaged her hearing. She has also survived efforts to force her into exile and numerous court cases in which she has been accused of corruption.\nBangladesh under Ms Hasina presents a contrasting picture. The Muslim-majority nation, once one of the world's poorest, has achieved credible economic success under her leadership since 2009.\nIt's now one of the fastest-growing economies in the region, even surpassing its giant neighbour India. Its per capita income has tripled in the last decade and the World Bank estimates that more than 25 million people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 20 years.\nMuch of this growth has been fuelled by the garment industry, which accounts for the vast majority of total exports from Bangladesh and has expanded rapidly in recent decades, supplying markets in Europe, North America and Asia.\nUsing the country's own funds, loans and development assistance, Ms Hasina's government has also undertaken huge infrastructure projects, including the flagship $2.9bn Padma bridge across the Ganges. \nThe latest protests were the most serious challenge Ms Hasina faced since taking office, and followed a highly controversial election in which her party was re-elected for a fourth straight parliamentary term.\nThe unrest began with a demand to abolish quotas in civil service jobs but turned into a wider anti-government movement as she used the police to violently crack down on protesters, killing more than 200 and injuring many more. \nAmid increasing calls for her to resign, she had remained defiant. She condemned the agitators as \u201cterrorists\u201d and appealed for support to \"suppress these terrorists with a firm hand\". She also threw hundreds of people into jail and brought criminal charges against hundreds more. \nThe agitation against quotas came as Bangladesh struggled with the escalating cost of living in the wake of the pandemic. Inflation has skyrocketed, the country's foreign exchange reserves have dropped precipitously, and its foreign debt has doubled since 2016.\nCritics blamed this on ",
    "The Sunday Times reports that the director of public prosecutions believes hundreds more people involved in the riots will be hauled before the courts in the coming days. Stephen Parkinson says some of them could face up to ten years in prison. He said that so far most of those prosecuted had been charged with violent disorder, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. But he tells the paper the next phase will involve prosecutors considering the more serious offence of rioting, which could mean up to ten years.\nThe Observer highlights its interview with the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, who lays the blame for the 'crisis-hit' criminal justice system squarely at the door of the Conservatives. She argues that record court backlogs and prison overcrowding inherited from the previous government makes it extremely difficult to process the huge numbers of people involved in the violence. She praises the police, lawyers and judges for showing they can 'rise to the challenge' in the wake of the unrest, but says their job has been made harder with the system 'inherited' from the Tories.\nAccording to the Sunday Telegraph, a revamp of the school curriculum after last week's unrest will teach children as young as five to spot fake news online. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said it was more important than ever that young children were given critical thinking skills, to arm them against what she calls putrid conspiracy theories. Much of the violence was triggered by false claims online that the Southport attacks were carried out by an asylum seeker. The paper says those claims were then inflamed by more sophisticated forms of disinformation such as websites set up to imitate newspapers. The review will look at teaching children to spot extremist content by including more critical thinking skills in subjects such as Maths, English and Information and Communications Technology.\nThe Sunday Express, Mirror, Mail and Telegraph all carry a picture of the family of six-year-old Bebe King who died in the Southport attacks last month. Her parents - Lauren and Ben King - released a statement revealing that Bebe's elder sister Genie witnessed the stabbings before escaping, and praised her incredible strength and courage. They said her resilience was a testament to the love and bond she shared with her little sister.\nThe Sunday Telegraph reports that NHS X-ray staff are now being told to ask men if they are pregnant before scans, as part of inclusivity guidance. The new guidelines were written after a trans man, who was unknowingly pregnant, had a CT scan. X-rays and scans can be harmful to unborn babies. But NHS staff have told the paper the new rules are causing confusion and anger among patients.\nFinally, senior Whitehall staff are said to have told the Mail on Sunday that Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, Sue Gray, is blocking access to the prime minister, to the extent he's being denied vital security briefings. The paper claims Ms Gray wields such power that even the head of the home civil service, Simon Case, has been forced to ask her permission to speak to Sir Keir. But a Downing Street source tells the paper the Prime Minister is having weekly National Security Council meetings, and regular security briefings.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

Do I feel threatened? No of course I don't because I am a politician that engages with the public,\" Mr Davies said. \n\"What is wrong with putting a question to people at an agricultural show when you're trying to engage with people as they go past your stand?\n\"If you want to engage with a group of society that do hold a view contrary to yours you pose a question and then you engage with them on a one-to-one basis.\"\nDespite unhappiness within the Conservative Senedd group, it is not thought a leadership challenge is imminent, largely because there is no obvious replacement for Mr Davies.",

And for once many in Israel, Lebanon and Iran have something in common - a war of nerves.\nThey worry and they wait for what may come next. It feels like the whole region is holding its breath.\nIs this the slide towards an all-out regional war? Can a ceasefire be wrestled from the ruins of Gaza?

The Shia Islamist armed group and political party - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Britain and the US - said it was acting in support of the Palestinian people.\nSince October, Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire, causing tens of thousands to flee on both sides of their shared border, and killing more than 500 in Lebanon, most of them fighters.  Israeli officials say 40 people have been killed there \u2013 26 of them soldiers.\nFears of a wider conflict were raised at the end of July, when an Israeli strike in Beirut killed a senior Hezbollah commander.\nIsrael blamed him for the killing of 12 children in a rocket attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in Syria.\nIt\u2019s already all-out war in Gaza, where Israel has killed almost 40,000 Palestinians at last count, according to figures from the Hamas run  health ministry \u2013 data the World Health Organisation regards as credible.\nGaza is the main concern for Ayman Sakr. He is fishing alongside Heba, but their views are far apart.\nThe 50-year-old taxi driver insists that if all-out war comes, Lebanon will deal with it. \u201cThere is some concern, but we can handle it,\u201c he tells us. \u201cIn the end we will defend ourselves.

    "A town council hall is undergoing a major \u00a35.4m redevelopment in an effort to increase revenue for the local economy.\nUnder the plans, Somerset's Bridgwater Town Hall's theatre will be refurbished to make it more accessible. The building's environmental credentials will also be improved, and unused rooms will be transformed into functional spaces.\nBridgwater Town Council confirmed \u00a33.9m of the total cost will come from a loan.\nA council spokesperson said all the work is fully costed, and there will be no requirement to increase council tax.\nResidents told the BBC that they hope the improvements will bring business to the surrounding area, as the town hall does not serve its own food.\nHowever, some are concerned that the money could have been spent better elsewhere.\nDeb Richardson, from the educational charity and film production company Somerset Film, uses the venue.\nShe told BBC Radio Somerset: \"There are times when we need a bigger venue. The cultural programming of that venue is really diverse.\n\"I think it's great for the town. I think it's an investment into local people.\n\"This is a venue that anyone can hire, and why shouldn't they have great facilities?\"\nSome of the residents in Bridgwater however are worried that the money should have been spent on fighting anti-social behaviour instead.\nTo this, Ms Richardson added: \"It's not the town council's role to invest in the police. And actually, they invested in town wardens.\n\"Part of it is giving those people an alternative, something to go and do. We have to look at what is behind that behaviour.\"\n\nChief executive of the council Dave Mears said the project was an \"exciting opportunity\" for Bridgwater.\nHe added that the reason it was an expensive project was the \"sheer size of the site\".\n\"We've got a massive theatre here,\" he said. \"It's one of the largest theatres in the area.\n\"Although it is tidy and presentable when you go in, it is tired now, and I think that's the biggest challenge with this space and the lack of accessibility in there.\n\"It is a lot of money to borrow, but we are not needing to increase council tax to service this loan.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Two of the earliest pioneers of photojournalism, who captured groundbreaking images of street life and political upheaval, are being honoured with blue plaques at their former homes.\nChristina Broom, one of Britain\u2019s first female press photographers, recorded the burgeoning suffragette movement in the early 1900s.\nJohn Thomson captured Victorian street characters, such as 'Hookey Alf of Whitechapel' and the 'Mush-Fakers' of Clapham, as well as his travels to Asia.\nEnglish Heritage's historian, Rebecca Preston, said both photojournalists were \"working at the forefront of photography at a time when it was not the accessible medium that it is now\".\nChristina Broom only began to experiment with photography in her forties, using a box camera.\nHer life - and contribution to photojournalism - is being honoured with a blue plaque at the house in Munster Road, Fulham, west London, where she lived and worked, alongside her daughter Winifred.\nHer pictures, including soldiers setting off to fight in World War One and members of the Royal Family, appeared in what was then a male-dominated newspaper industry.\nFrom the early 1900s, Broom began to sell postcards of her photos from a stall beside Buckingham Palace, showing images of contemporary London, including historic images of the women's suffragette movement.\nBroom regularly photographed activists and public demonstrations in support of women's right to vote. Her work included portraits of leading figures such as Christabel Pankhurst, who co-founded the Women's Social and Political Union.\nShe died in 1939, but her daughter carried on living in the same house in Fulham, which was filled with thousands of her mother's photographs, until her own death in 1973.\nJohn Thomson, the Scottish-born photographer whose plaque will be place at his home in Effra Road, in Brixton, south London, recorded some of the impoverished characters living on the fringes of late 19th Century society in London.\nHis photographs include Hookey Alf of Whitechapel, who wore a hook in place of the arm he lost in an industrial accident, and hung around the streets of east London looking for casual labour.\nOther memorable images in Thomson's catalogue include the 'mush-fakers' in Clapham, who sold and repaired umbrellas - their colloquial name coming from the mushroom shape of the umbrellas.\nHis photojournalism, deliberately intended to prick the consciences of the Victorian middle classes, included a poignant picture of a destitute woman in Covent Garden, taken in 1877 and entitled 'The Crawlers'.\nThomson, who received a royal warrant for his work in 1881, also recorded his travels to Asia, in what was then an innovative mix of photos and text.\nHe took the first known photographs of the temple of Angkor Wat, in the country known today as Cambodia.\nCarrying his bulky camera equipment, Thomson travelled to Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong and China, documenting his trip with photographs of the cultural life around him.\n\"We are now making history,\" he said in 1891, heralding the new form of journalism which brought pictures and stories to a new and wider audience.",
    "A man who beat his father to death in his own home after consuming cocaine and drinking alcohol has been given a life sentence.\nMalcolm McGarry, 76, was found in his property in Northfields Close, Sutton in Ashfield, on 1 December last year.\nHis son Peter admitted murder during an appearance at Nottingham Crown Court in April and was jailed on Friday.\nThe 53-year-old, of Alexandra Street in Kirkby in Ashfield, must serve a minimum term of 14 years and 123 days in prison, which reflects time already served in jail.\nA sentencing hearing held at Nottingham Crown Court heard the father and son  watched football together on 30 November.\nMalcolm - who was paralysed down his left side after a stroke years earlier - was found badly injured in the living room the following day.\n\"The scene was truly grotesque and macabre,\" said Gordon Aspden KC, prosecuting.\nMr Aspden said the defendant was described as being \"incoherent\" and \"under the influence of drink and/or drugs\", adding Peter told people at the scene the injured man was not his father.\n\"He appeared to be under the impression, that the man he had beaten to death was an intruder,\" he said.\nEmergency services arrived at the scene but Malcolm could not be revived, and he was pronounced dead.\nA pathologist gave a cause of death as severe traumatic brain injury and blunt force facial injuries.\nMr Aspden said Malcolm \"had taken a truly savage beating at the hands of this defendant, with fatal consequences\".\nMr Aspden told the court the defendant was arrested at the scene, and told officers he had given the victim \"a good hiding\", but denied it was his father.\nPeter also admitted taking drink and drugs and said he \"had no recollection of events after that\".\nDefending, James Horne KC said the murder \"was neither planned nor thought out\", adding Peter had been suffering problems with his mental and physical health and had been affected by the murder of his nephew in 2020.\nHe said father and son had a \"great relationship\" and were \"extremely close\", talking almost daily, and Peter viewed the events leading to Malcolm's death with \"utter disbelief and eternal regret\".\nSaying there was \"little doubt\" that at the time of the attack Peter \"was under the deluded and intoxicated impression that he had assaulted an intruder\", Mr Horne said the defendant has \"deep and profound regret\" over his behaviour.\n\"The sense of loss he feels in that regard is compounded by the fact that he's responsible for it,\" he said.\n\nSentencing, Judge Stuart Rafferty KC said the \"tragic death\" of Malcolm was \"avoidable\" and down to his son's actions.\n\"It's almost impossible to believe that anyone could become so affected by alcohol and drugs as to cease to recognise a person that they had been in the same room with, forgetting who that person was in terms of his appearance and his personage, and embark on a lethal attack, which is what happened in this case,\" he said.\n\"You've deprived yourself, and more importantly, other people, of a man of value and great esteem.\"\nReferring to Peter's use of \"pernicious substances\", Judge Rafferty said the deceased \"could not gauge the rage that was building in you\", adding others in the community who had respected him were not aware of his \"dark side\".\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Police in New Zealand are racing to trace sweets containing \"potentially lethal levels of methamphetamine\" after they were distributed by a charity in Auckland. \nUp to 400 people may have received the sweets from Auckland City Mission as part of a food parcel, said the anti-poverty charity.\nThe sweets were donated anonymously by a member of the public in a sealed retail package, it added. \nAt least three people, including a child, sought medical attention afterwards though none are currently in hospital. \n\"We did not know that the lollies contained methamphetamine when they were distributed,\" the charity's spokesperson told the BBC. \nEach individual sweet could have a street value of around NZ$1,000 ($601; \u00a3468), according to the New Zealand Drug Foundation.\nPolice say while the incident could be accidental rather than a targeted operation, they had not drawn any conclusions as it is \u201ca bit early to say\u201d.\nThe charity alerted the authorities on Tuesday after being alerted by a recipient about the \"funny tasting\" sweets. \nHelen Robinson, chief executive of Auckland City Mission, said that some of the charity's staff members tried the sweets themselves and agreed with the complaints, and started to \"feel funny\" afterwards.\nThey then sent sweets that were still on site to the NZ Drug Foundation for tests, which confirmed that potentially lethal levels of methamphetamine were contained in the samples.\nIn a statement, the foundation said they found about 3g of methamphetamine in a sweet that was sent for testing. \n\u201cA common dose to swallow is between 10-25mg, so this contaminated lolly contained up to 300 doses,\u201d says its head Sarah Helm, adding that swallowing such amount of the drug is \"extremely dangerous and could result in death\".\nMethamphetamine can cause chest pain, racing heart, seizures, hyperthermia, delirium and loss of consciousness, according to the foundation.\nAccording to Ms Robinson, the mission distributes around 50,000 food parcels a year and only commercially manufactured food are included in these parcels. \n\nPolice have asked people that have sweets wrapped in brand Rinda's yellow pineapple flavour packaging to contact them immediately.\n\"It's vital the public are aware of these lollies and the hazard that they present,\" Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said in a press conference on Wednesday.\nDescribing it as a \"deeply concerning\" matter, he said that such cases of food laced with meth had happened before and they would likely work with Interpol on the investigation, which may take some time.\nRinda, a Malaysian confectioner, told BBC News that it has come to their attention that their products may have been misused in connection with illegal substances and the company \"does not use or condone the use of any illegal drugs\" in their products.\n\"We will work closely with law enforcement and relevant authorities to address this issue and protect the integrity of our brand,\" the firm said in a statement.\nSteven Peh, the general manager of Rinda, told local news site Stuff NZ that the  contaminated candy he had seen in photos was white, whereas Rinda\u2019s product is yellow.\nThe authorities are still trying to understand the scale of the spread. 16 packets have been recovered so far \u2013 police say each packet could possibly contain 20 \u2013 30 sweets but they don\u2019t know the exact number in the 16 packets. Up to 400 people have been contacted by the charity.\nMs Robinson said the sweets likely came into the charity's posession in about mid-July, but that they are calling everyone as far back as 1 July to be safe.\nBen Birks Ang, deputy director of the NZ Drug Foundation, said the organisation believes the incident was unlikely to be intentional as \"disclosing substances as something else to smuggle it into another area is common\".\nBut there are still fears that other charities could be affected.\nMs Robinson said she had contacted other charities to check for their sweets.\n\"To say we are devastated is an absolute understatement,\" she told the press, adding that one in five in New Zealand experience food insecurity, which makes the incident \u201cdeeply distressing\u201d.\nAdditional reporting by Peter Hoskins from Singapore",
    "A council could spend \u00a33.3m to create 54 new school places at two schools.\nNorth Northamptonshire Council is considering the idea in response to a shortage of places for 11-year-olds.\nOfficials said work on expanding the two schools would have to start this month.\nBoth Wrenn School in Wellingborough and Wollaston School have agreed to the expansion.\nThe council said it had predicted a \"significant deficit of Year 7 places across North Northamptonshire in September\".\nThe expansion plan would involve spending \u00a31.7m on creating 16 extra places next month at Wollaston School.\nFirst opened in 1958 in the village of Wollaston, four miles (6.4km) from Wellingborough, the school has about 1,400 pupils aged from 11 to 18.\nAnother eight permanent places would be created during the next academic year.\nWrenn has 1,300 pupils and is split across three sites. The building on London Road opened in 1911 as the Wellingborough County High School for girls, while the Doddington Road site was built in 1930 as the Grammar School for boys.\nThis project is likely to start next month, to be ready by September 2025.\nThe expansions would be funded by so-called Section 106 payments, made by developers to mitigate a housing development's wider impact, and by the Department for Education.\nThe Conservative council's executive will discuss the scheme on 15 August.\nScott Edwards, the Conservative executive member for education, said: \"The proposal addresses a resolution in solving the significant deficit of Year 7 places across North Northamptonshire. \n\"The increase of in-year applications has been impacting on all schools for several years now and this has reduced the available capacity to accommodate bulge and accept in year placements. \n\"This can only be good news if agreed.\"\nOfficials have told councillors that, even with the expansion project, the area would not reach the 5% surplus in school places recommended by the government.\nThey have predicted that the council could have a shortfall of places again if the number of late applications continued at the current pace.\nThe same meeting would also discuss a plan to build a new special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) unit in Rushden.\nThe \u00a32,328,800 project would involve creating four classrooms at Whitefriars Primary School in the town by September 2025.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Ukrainian troops have advanced up to 30km inside Russia, in what has become the deepest and most significant incursion since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nRussia's defence ministry said its forces had engaged Ukrainian troops near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, as the offensive in the Kursk region entered a sixth day. \nForeign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova accused Kyiv of \"intimidating the peaceful population of Russia\".\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky, who directly acknowledged the attack for the first time in an address last night, said 2,000 cross-border attacks had been launched by Russia from Kursk this summer. \n\"Artillery, mortars, drones. We also record missile strikes, and each such strike deserves a fair response,\" Mr Zelensky told the country in his nightly address from Kyiv. \nA senior Ukrainian official told the AFP news agency that thousands of troops were engaged in the operation, far more than the small incursion initially reported by Russian border guards. \nWhile Ukrainian-backed sabotage groups have launched intermittent cross-border incursions, the Kursk offensive marks the biggest co-ordinated attack on Russian territory by Kyiv's conventional forces.  \n\u201cWe are on the offensive. The aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border,\u201d the official said. \nRussia's defence ministry said on Sunday that its forces had \"foiled attempts by enemy mobile groups with armoured vehicles to break through deep into Russian territory\". \nBut in an apparent admission that Kyiv's forces have now advanced deep into the Kursk border region, the defence ministry reported engaging Ukrainian troops near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez - which are about 25km and 30km from the Russia-Ukraine border.\nFootage circulating online and verified by the BBC also appeared to show a Russian strike near the village of Levshinka, around 25km from the border.\nUkrainian troops have claimed to have captured a number of settlements in the Kursk region. In Guevo, a village about 3km inside Russia, soldiers filmed themselves removing the Russian flag from an administrative building.\nClips have also emerged of Ukrainian troops seizing administrative buildings in Sverdlikovo and Poroz, while intense fighting has been reported in Sudzha - a town of about 5,000 people. \nUkrainian troops have already filmed themselves outside Sudzha at a major gas facility involved in the transit of natural gas from Russia to the EU via Ukraine, which has continued despite the war.\nIn Sumy region, which borders the Kursk region, BBC reporters witnessed a steady stream of armoured personnel carriers and tanks moving towards Russia. \nThe armoured convoys are sporting white triangular insignias, seemingly to distinguish them from hardware used within Ukraine itself. Meanwhile, aerial photos have appeared to show Ukrainian tanks engaged in combat inside Russia. \nPhotos analysed by BBC Verify also appeared to show Russia constructing new defensive lines near the Kursk nuclear power plant. Ukrainian forces engaged at  Obshchy Kolodez were within 50km (31 miles) of the facility. \nContrasting satellite imagery of the same location captured yesterday with imagery from a few days earlier, images show several newly constructed trench lines in the vicinity, with the nearest roughly 8km (5 miles) from the plant.\nRussia says 76,000 people have been evacuated from border areas in the Kursk region, where a state of emergency has been declared by local authorities. \nActing regional governor Aleksei Smirnov also said 15 people were injured late on Saturday when the wreckage of a downed Ukrainian missile fell on a multi-storey building in Kursk's regional capital, Kursk.\nOleksiy Goncharenko - a Ukrainian MP - hailed the operation and said it was \"taking us much closer to peace than one hundred peace summits\". \n\"When Russia needs to fight back on their own territory, when Russian people are running, when people care, that's the only way to show them stop this war,\" he told the BBC. \nThe Kursk offensive comes after weeks of Russian advances in the east, where a succession of villages have been captured by the Kremlin's forces.\nSome analysts have suggested that the Kursk attack is part of an effort to force Russia to redeploy forces away from eastern Ukraine and relieve pressure on the beleaguered Ukrainian defences. \nBut the Ukrainian official told AFP there had been little let-up to date in Russian operations in the east. \nEarlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the offensive was a \"major provocation\". \nMeanwhile, emergency services in the Kyiv region said a man and his four-year-old son were killed in a missile strike near the capital overnight. \nAir defences also destroyed 53 out of 57 attack drones launched by Russia during its overnight airstrikes, air force officials said.

She declined to comment.\nNewyddion S4C subsequently asked whether she stands by her comments on the 'Beti a'i Phobol' programme following Edwards' guilty plea this week. \nIn her written statement, she did not address that point directly.\nDame Elan said revelations from the the court had come as a shock to her and that she was \"horrified by it all\".\nShe added her \"thoughts are with the children whose images are central to this story\".\nNewyddion S4C also asked the BBC whether Dame Elan was informed of Edwards' arrest last November and the nature of the investigation, but it is yet to receive a response.\nThe BBC launched an internal investigation into allegations about Edwards' conduct, but the findings have not been published.\nNewyddion S4C made a freedom of information request asking for any notes or correspondence relating to that investigation earlier this year.\nIt was rejected on 20 May, citing data protection laws relating to personal data.\nAfter publication of the Sun's initial story, police confirmed that there had been no criminality.\nBut Edwards was arrested in November last year in relation to allegations of making indecent images of children. \nMr Davie has confirmed he was made aware of the arrest and the nature of the allegations against Edwards, though not the specifics revealed this week, and said the police requested the information remained confidential.\nEdwards was charged in June, information not made public until this week in court listings \nHe admitted having 41 indecent and illegal images of children on his phone.\nSeven of the images were in the most serious category, with two images depicting children between around seven and nine years old.\nEdwards was one of Wales\u2019 most high-profile public figure as a main presenters on BBC One's News at Ten and often fronting coverage of major national events until last year.\nHe pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children on Wednesday. \nAdditional reporting, Bryn Jones",
    "A 17-year-old charged with murdering three girls who were stabbed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport has been named.\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana is also charged with 10 counts of attempted murder after eight other children and two adults were seriously injured in the attack on Monday.\nThe suspect, who is from the Lancashire village of Banks, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court, and also faces a charge of possessing a curved kitchen knife.\nHe was remanded into youth detention accommodation. \nThe Cardiff-born teenager could not previously be named due to his age but Recorder of Liverpool Judge Andrew Menary KC ruled it could be made public following applications from the media.\nThe defendant is due to turn 18 next week.\nThe judge said he was mindful of \"misinformation\" that had spread regarding the accused's identity. \nSouthport saw a night of unrest on Tuesday following a vigil in memory of the victims, with protesters gathering near a mosque in the Merseyside town.\nFive men were arrested - with one later charged with possessing a knife - after a police van was set alight and bricks were thrown, with 53 police officers injured. \nA further Section 60 order, which gives police enhanced powers to stop and search and is designed to minimise violence, was put in place on Thursday evening. \nThis follows the original Section 60 order brought in for 24 hours from 17:00 BST on Wednesday evening.\nThe latest order came into effect at 18:00 BST and will also last for 24 hours, with extra officers in the area, Merseyside Police said.\nJudge Menary said: \"Continuing to prevent full reporting at this stage has a disadvantage of allowing others up to mischief to continue to spread misinformation in a vacuum.\"\nHe acknowledged his decision was \"exceptional\" but said \"the balance clearly comes down in favour of the public interest in allowing full reporting of these proceedings\".\nArguing against naming the defendant, the prosecution said he had an \"autism spectrum disorder diagnosis\" and had been \"unwilling to leave the house and communicate with family for a period of time\".\nHe attended an appearance at a youth court at about 09:00 BST, arriving in a prison van with a large police escort.\nIn front of a packed press gallery, he glanced at reporters before he was asked to sit down before District Judge James Hatton.\nWearing a grey police-issued tracksuit, the defendant pulled his sweatshirt above his nose and lowered his head during the five-minute hearing, in which he did not speak.\nNone of the families of the victims or the defendant were in court.\nThe accused will next appear at Liverpool Crown Court on 25 October for a pre-trial preparation hearing.\nBebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, died after the stabbings on Hart Street in the Merseyside town, just before midday on Monday. \nEight children and two adults were also seriously injured.\nEarlier on Thursday, Alder Hey Children's Hospital confirmed two children who were being treated there had been discharged.\nThe hospital said it was continuing to treat five other children, and all were now in a stable condition.\nA statement read: \"We are delighted that two of the children involved in Monday's awful incident have now been discharged.\n\"Our heartfelt sympathies remain with all those affected.\"\nThe hospital also thanked Taylor Swift fans for raising more than \u00a3340,000.\nSet up by two members of the Taylor Swift UK & EU Facebook Group, the fundraiser has had donations from fans around the world.\n\u201cThank you for embodying the spirit of Taylor\u2019s music and for turning empathy into action,\u201d the hospital said.\nFollowing Tuesday's disturbances in Southport, further disorder broke out in areas across England, with more than 100 people arrested at a protest in central London on Wednesday night. \nThere were also incidents in Hartlepool, Manchester and Aldershot.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"action will be taken\" following the \"violent disorder\" at a meeting with police chiefs at Downing Street earlier.\nSpeaking in a televised speech afterwards, he laid out plans for forces across the country to increase their co-operation to tackle such incidents.\nHe described the widespread disorder as the \"actions of a tiny, mindless minority\" and condemned \"far-right hatred\".\nThe prime minister added: \"These thugs are mobile, they move from community to community, and we must have a police response that can do the same.\"\nFollowing Monday's attack, the families of Bebe King and Alice Dasilva Aguiar issued tributes and asked for privacy.\nBebe's family said \"no words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as try to deal with the loss\".\nThe family of Alice said \"keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess\".\nAdditional reporting by Rumeana Jahangir, Monica Rimmer, Phil McCann & PA Media\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Executive ministers condemned recent violence ahead of the Northern Ireland Assembly being recalled.\nFirst Minister Michelle O\u2019Neill said the executive is \u201cunequivocally\u201d collective in its determination to say no to racism.\nShe said there is \u201cno place for racism in our society\u201d, adding that it is \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d. \nOn Thursday afternoon during the recall, MLAs backed an Alliance motion condemning the recent disorder and rejecting \u201call forms of racism\u201d in Northern Ireland.\nMs O\u2019Neill said people from ethnic minorities were afraid to go about their normal routines.\n\u201cWe have healthcare workers who are afraid to go to their work, we have nurses who are afraid to go home,\u201d she said.\nThat is \u201cthe real human impact\u201d of this type of racist activity, she added. \nDeputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said Northern Ireland's political parties were \"sending a strong and united message against violence, disorder and racism\".\nThe fact that some healthcare workers are thinking of leaving as a result of the violence is \"deeply disturbing\", Ms Little-Pengelly said, emphasising their \"huge\" contribution.\nShe also wanted to acknowledge the \"positive contribution of many ethnic minority people\" in Northern Ireland.\nViolence is always \"wrong\" and \"never the answer\", she added.\nJustice Minister Naomi Long said the disorder was not representative of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland.\n\u201cWe need to call it for what it is. It is racism; it is Islamophobia,\" she said. \n\"If we\u2019re going to deal with it, we need to name it what it is, and we need to challenge it.\u201d\nThe Alliance leader said the people being attacked are \u201cpart of our community\u201d and \u201cvalued\u201d.\n\u201cIt is incumbent on all of us in political leadership, but also all of us as a community to make them feel that they are welcome and safe,\u201d she added.\nBy Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political correspondent\nIt's not often you hear a round of applause in the assembly chamber.\nBut that happened on several occasions on Thursday as MLAs reflected on events of the past week.\nMembers of minority community groups sat and watched in the public gallery as politicians addressed them directly, offering words of support and of condemnation against what has happened so far.\nWhile recall debates are often described as little more than talking shops, many felt the seriousness of the situation demanded our politicians' presence today.\nPoliticians may struggle in the short-term to change attitudes, but there is pressure on the executive to act in certain policy areas, such as updating racial equality strategies.\nStrategies which at surface level may not mean much, have practical consequences for how those communities are represented and the access to services they get.\nThere is also the question of better resources for the PSNI.\nYesterday, when I asked the secretary of state could he commit to improved funding for the organisation, he said it was a matter for the executive to prioritise what they already have for this year.\nToday, the first and deputy first ministers told me they're still fighting to get the Treasury to improve our funding formula and insisted the PSNI will not be \"alone\" in tackling this issue.\nSpeaking in the assembly, DUP MLA for Upper Bann, Jonathan Buckley, said he wanted to make it \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that he condemned the violence \u201con our streets and across the United Kingdom\u201d.\nHe expressed his sympathy for the families of the victims of the knife attack in Southport on 29 July in which three young girls died.\nSDLP South Belfast MLA Matthew O\u2019Toole welcomed members of the Muslim community to the assembly chamber.\n\u201cWe owe them an apology for what they and their community have had to endure in this society and city over recent weeks and days,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken praised the work of ethnic minority health workers, saying he spent several hours in Antrim Area Hospital on Wednesday with one of his children.\nHe said those in the emergency department were grateful for the \"professional medical care they were receiving\".\nMr Aiken said some \"very misguided\" people thought it was appropriate to attack immigrants.\n\"It has to stop, it has to stop now,\" he stressed.\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly was recalled following a successful petition, put forward by the Alliance Party.\nThis meant MLAs have returned from their summer break to discuss recent disorder.\nIt follows a spate of violence, with several businesses in the city attacked after an anti-immigration protest erupted into disorder.\nThe first minister and deputy first ministers have said their joint priority is to face down racism and intimidation.\nThere has been violent disorder in towns and cities across the UK since last Tuesday, the day after three young girls were killed in Southport.\nFalse claims on social media followed that someone who had arrived in the UK illegally was to blame.\nOn Saturday, a cafe was set alight and several businesses were attacked after disorder broke out in Belfas",
    "World-famous graffiti artist Banksy has concluded his animal trail, after nine days of pop-up artworks dotted around the capital ended with a piece on the shutters of London Zoo.\nAlthough all the surprise pieces have now been unveiled, speculation over the inspiration behind them persists. What do they mean, and how have they been received by the art and graffiti worlds?\nBanksy's final piece, outside London Zoo in Camden, north London, shows a gorilla lifting the shutter to release a sea lion and birds, while other animals appear to look on from the inside.\nBut the series of artworks was set in motion with a piece on 5 August appearing to show a goat perched on a ledge as rocks fall on a wall in Kew Green in Richmond, south-west London.\nThis was swiftly followed on 6 August with a work depicting two elephants reaching for each other\u2019s trunks, and three monkeys hanging from a railway bridge in Brick Lane, east London, on 7 August.\nBy day three, online speculation was rife as to whether the series had a deeper meaning.\nPerhaps the goat was a metaphor for standing on the edge of a moment of change, or the two elephants were reaching across from different sides of something? Maybe the three monkeys represented the \"wise monkeys\" in the Japanese proverb of the \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\" fame?\nTheories have ranged from the series focusing on social division amidst recent riots, to the Israel-Gaza conflict.\nJames Ryan, CEO of Grove Gallery which sells Banksy originals and prints, told BBC London he initially thought the works had \"politically charged and motivated messages, so the goat - references to Palestine and Gaza, and then the wolf crying for help - some kind of persecution\".\nSince the final piece was revealed, however, he believes there is a theme of \"incarceration; animals being trapped\" in the series.\nMr Ryan added while there were new elements to Banksy's campaign such as building momentum by posting a daily \"teaser\" on social media, there were also references to his previous work with the gorilla piece being reminiscent of his 2006 \"Sweep It Under the Carpet\" work depicting a maid with a dustpan and brush which was also painted in north London.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the street artist has delivered a series of daily works, as he previously used the format for his Staycation series in East Anglia, in New Orleans and during his month-long New York \"residency\". \nJames Peak, presenter of the BBC\u2019s The Banksy Story, explained the artist was \"very keen on animal welfare\" and \"helped Greenpeace out with a campaign a few years ago\".\nHe said the artist also made ecological themes part of his work in the past, writing cardboard placards and throwing them into the ape enclosures at Longleat and Melbourne Zoo in Australia, \"so the apes were holding up bits of cardboard saying things like 'please help me I\u2019m the victim of a cruel scientific experiment' or even 'I\u2019m a celebrity get me out of here'.\"\nHe added Banksy campaigns \"often only really make sense backwards\".\nThis series could simply represent \"this grand great escape that the gorilla has caused from London Zoo, which explains why there are all these animals over London this last week\", he said.\nOr it could have \"a really serious kind of point to it - maybe that we\u2019re not doing enough to ensure animals globally have enough natural space,\" he added.\nThe pieces haven\u2019t been without their share of problems either.\nThe howling wolf sprayed on a satellite dish in Peckham, south-east London, was seemingly taken by thieves.\nTwo others were removed by London authorities, with the first - a silhouette of a cat painted on a billboard on Edgware Road in Cricklewood - was taken down for safety reasons.\nThe City of London Corporation said the other painted on 11 August - swimming piranhas on a City of London Police sentry box - had been taken to Guildhall Yard so it could be viewed safely. \nTwo more were defaced, including the two elephants which received some spray-painted white stripes.\nHowever, it is the vandalism on the second-to-last artwork, of a rhinoceros (originally mounting a Nissan Micra with a traffic cone on its bonnet) in Charlton, south-east London, which resurrected an old feud between Banksy and his revered rival Robbo.\nAhmad Karkouti, from graffiti and street art podcast Arms House to your Mums House, told BBC London the white S, or a dollar sign, and a V sign stood for a local graffiti crew called South Vandals.\nHe added he received footage of the defacing with the message \"South Vandals 4 life! Team Robbo\".\nMr Karkouti explained the late Robbo, who was from London, was inspired by differences in the way socially acceptable street art was appreciated compared to traditional graffiti, which was widely regarded as criminal damage.\nWhile hidden meanings and wider battles are still up for debate, one thing clear in enthusiasts' eyes is that Banksy has successfully grabbed the world's attention - again.\nMr Ryan said the series has \"had the d",
    "A charity has opened a new food bank in a coastal town where people \"struggle\" to pay high rents and energy bills.\nThe Rainbow Centre already operates a service in Scarborough and has now set up a branch in Filey.\n The town lost its food bank when the Filey Community Fridge closed in April, when an agreement to use its premises ended.\nThe organisation said there was a \"big need\" to tackle food poverty and that many people had been travelling from Filey to use the Scarborough distribution point.\nNorth Yorkshire Council approached The Rainbow Centre, which has run Scarborough's food bank for 27 years, to provide the service.\nJo Laking, the charity's chief executive, said: \"There is a big need for it because there are many families and pensioners living in food poverty in Filey.\"\nFiley Community Fridge, which was volunteer-run for five years, donated their equipment to the project and Filey Lions supplied a fridge and freezer.\n\"On the first day we had people queuing to get in and six volunteers also turned up, which really felt like the whole community rallying round to help us,\" said Ms Laking. \nThe food bank will be based at Filey Methodist Church and users will be means-tested by need before they can receive items.\nMs Laking said: \"We're getting busier than ever as the prices in the supermarkets continue to soar, and we know that demand for our service will go up once we go into autumn and energy bills go up again.\"\nShe said that the high cost of living in Filey, a popular tourist destination, created additional pressures in the town.\n\"Rents are very high in Filey and we know if you're paying high rents you don't always have the money left to pay for food to feed your family.\"\nThe Community Fridge project closed after funding ran out and the volunteers were told they could no longer use their base at the Co-op Funeralcare building, which was being turned into a chapel. \nMs Laking added: \"It was bittersweet opening the food bank as it was wonderful to celebrate The Rainbow Centre growing as an organisation, but it was also tinged with sadness that we even need food banks in this day and age.\n\"For me, we're not just helping people with food, we are supporting and listening to them too. They leave here fed, welcomed and knowing that there is help out there.\"\nFiley Food Bank is open every Tuesday and Friday at Filey Methodist Church on Union Street from 10:00 BST to 13:00 BST. \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "Researchers exploring so-called \"dark tourism\" are analysing the reactions of visitors to the most gruesome parts of Peterhead Prison Museum. \nThe prison closed its doors more than 10 years ago and then later reopened as a museum.\nIt remains largely unchanged, giving visitors a taste of what life was like, including some of the darker sides - such as brutal attacks by prisoners on each other, a punishment station where officers used a whip, a violent riot by inmates, and dirty protests.\nReactions of people are being filmed, and it is hoped the conclusions about how they responded could help the curators of museums in the future.\nThe data is being gathered and analysed by researchers at Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University (RGU).\nIt is hoped the study will provide a better understanding of how people react when faced with more troubling aspects of human history. \nThe project is called Talking about Prisons, with the RGU's Rachael Ironside the lead researcher.\n\"What we're looking at is how visitors interact with some of the museum spaces, in particular those spaces that deal with a more difficult type of heritage,\" she told BBC Scotland News.\n\"This particular project is looking at those in-the-moment interactions, that's what we're really interested in. Where do they look, what do they say?\"\nShe explained that \"subtle\" cameras are set up in rooms to catch \"natural reactions\".\nShe said the researchers were already finding that some people's coping mechanism appeared to be laughter rather than being disturbed.\n\"People use humour, that's a kind of interesting interaction,\" she said.\n\"We're coming to the end of data collection, and will bring our findings together.\"\nPeterhead Prison was once known as Scotland's toughest jail.\nAlex Geddes, the operations manager at Peterhead Prison Museum, thinks he knows what fascinates visitors, of all ages.\n\"I look back to the first week we opened in 2016 and we were speaking to people leaving, 'did you enjoy your tour?',\" he told BBC Scotland News.\n\"This one guy stopped and looked back and I did think 'he doesn't look impressed'.\n\"And his comment was 'I've always wanted to see in it but I've never wanted to be in it'.\n\"And I think that captures 99% of people coming through here. They've always wondered what's happening in here, but they never want to do anything wrong to end up in here.\"\nMr Geddes added: \"Maybe morbid's not the right word, but there's that dark side to things. People are intrigued. But they want to come in and get out on the same day.\n\"Everybody looks at things in history, probably want to go back in history just to see it, but not actually be part of it.\n\"A lot of people leave and they now have a full understanding of the work of the prison service.\"\nHe said the number one objective was that they \"didn't want a Disneyland\" but had wanted to keep it real.\n\"You get a wide range of feedback, some are shocked, others are kind of glad, they sometimes feel prisoners get an easy life in here, once they've been in and seen the conditions they change their views as well.\"\nHaving been built in 1888, Peterhead Prison eventually closed in 2013.\nIt was replaced in the town by HMP Grampian, which opened in 2014.",
    "How much is too much to pay for a cup of tea?\nAn anonymous customer wrote to the Toast Cafe and Deli in Wrexham on Monday after their \"shock\" about having to pay \u00a32.20 for a cuppa.\nBut is this expensive? I called up cafes across the UK and discovered it could cost anywhere from \u00a31 to \u00a33.30 in Wales, about \u00a32.80 in Manchester and \u00a33 in London.\nOne cafe owner said customers can be \"blind\" to the \"hidden costs\" of running businesses. \nSerena Hancock, 28, from Cardiff, said she had just been to a chain restaurant with her friends and paid \u00a33.30 for a cup of tea.\nHer sister Tianna Hancock, 28, added: \"You've got to think about it, it's literally a tea bag.\" \nAmaris Powell, 28, from Cardiff, said: \"If you buy a whole pack of teabags and then break it down per tea bag it would cost you nothing.\"\nSerena said elderly people should be given a free tea or one at a reduced rate as \u00a32.20 is \"expensive for them based on what they would have paid\".\n\"And it gives them a reason to go out each day.\"\nAmaris Powell said: \"It's not going to dent us, they get free bus passes, free trains, I'm pretty sure you could allow them to have a free tea.\" \nTianna Hancock agreed and said it should cost everyone else \u00a31.50.\nDavid Mort, 90, from Risca in Caerphilly said: \"For old age pensioners it's getting worse.\"\n\"A cup of tea, 20p - that's plenty. \u00a32.20 is not a fair price,\" he said. \"If it were me I wouldn't go in there, it's as simple as that.\"\nFadhili Maghiya, 40, from Cardiff, said: \"It depends on what kind of tea it is and where it's coming from - the cost of shipping and the producer being paid a fair wage.\" \n\"But then paying more than \u00a31.50 maybe is a little bit too much,\" he said.\n\"Obviously when you go to buy tea in a coffee shop and it's more than the whole box of 50 teabags. That's mental.\n\"To be priced out is extortion really, and it's not just older people it's younger people as well.\"\nHe added it was different if it was an independent shop as opposed to a chain and would be willing to pay \"a bit more\" because \"you want to support small businesses.\"\nLeo Lee-Thomas, 21, from Cardiff, said the maximum they would pay would be \u00a32.50 but thought it should cost \u00a32.20 to \u00a32.30 for one cup of tea.\nAiden Forrester, 22, from Aberdare, said: \"It's boiling water at the end of the day. \n\"They've got to make money so \u00a32.20 is fair,\" they added. \nJane Hides, 49, from New Quay in Ceredigion said she would expect to pay \u00a31.50 to \u00a32. \n\"I think people do look at it and think it's just a tea bag and some water,\" she said. \"However, it's still a product and everything comes at a cost.\"\nShe said paying \u00a32.20 is fair because businesses have \"bills to pay\". \nGary Solomon, owner of The Crows Nest Cafe in Milford Haven said he had to put the price of his cups of tea up from \u00a31.25 to \u00a31.50 when the minimum wage increased in April. \nHe said he factors in the delivery from the warehouse, the electric, the staff and the clearing up as well as the teabag and the water. \nThe cafe owner added that: \"If it's hot and it's inside, 20% of that goes straight to the government - so that's 30p already off the cost.\"\n\"The other part of the cost is holiday pay, PAYE contributions and national insurance.\"\nHe said when the menu's prices went up he put a sign out explaining the reason so has had no complaints. \nMr Solomon said a cup of tea is more than a teabag and people \"can be a bit blind to understand exactly what happens behind the door if they just see one person making a cup.\" \n\"It's the hidden costs people don't see,\" he added. \nMr Solomon said \u00a32.20 does \"seem a bit expensive\". \nJason Hughes, the general manager of Bwyd Da Bangor sells a pot of tea [which makes two cups] for \u00a33 and said the price factors in the tea bag, the sweeteners, the milk, the hot water and the teapot - as well as the washing up of the mug and pot when the customer is finished. \n\"We pay a fair living wage of \u00a312 per hour.\" He added that rent and ingredients were \"expensive\".\nMr Hughes said: \"People don't mind paying \u00a33 for a coffee for some reason. \n\"There seems to be a higher perceived value.\" ",
    "How do you survive a zombie apocalypse? Who are the best cats in science fiction?  Is Judge Dredd no longer a parody?\nThese are some of the varied questions being asked in Glasgow for this year's Worldcon, one of the world's biggest science fiction conventions.\nThe event's 82nd edition will welcome around 9000 fans to the city, with more than 900 panels and talks scheduled to take place over five days.\nOrganisers told BBC Scotland News that the diverse range of programming will include a local flavour, with a discussion on authors Iain Banks and Alasdair Gray and the world premiere of Scottish opera Morrow's Isle.  \nThe convention, which begins on Thursday, will also see the presentation of the prestigious Hugo awards, recognising the best science fiction literature of the past year.\n\"It\u2019s one of those rare opportunities where the world comes to you,\" says Tendai Huchu, a Zimbabwean/Scottish author taking part in several panels this year. \n\"There are so many panels going on. You can just stumble into things and who knows what direction you will end up going down. It\u2019s a great opportunity to meet other people, find out what is going on, what trends are happening and just talk shop.\"\nFirst held in New York in 1939, Worldcon has welcomed many giants of science fiction and fantasy over the years, whether as guests or attendees, with 2024 marking the third time Glasgow has hosted it. \nUnlike major comic-cons where the emphasis is often on celebrity guests and dealers selling collectables, Worldcon is centred around the literary side of the genre, with discussion and talks to the fore.   \n\"Around 65% of people attending will be hearing someone talk at any given time,\" says Esther MacCallum-Stewart, the chairperson for the 2024 gathering.\n\"I believe there are 984 different things happening over the five days, and that doesn\u2019t include things that are self-organised on the side. \n\"A lot of it is chosen by the community. We ask for suggestions for panels and people send in things that either they would like to do, or that they would like to see. It\u2019s a really nice way of levelling the playing field in terms of what's discussed.\"\nOrganisers dedication to keeping the playing field level attracted worldwide attention earlier this year when the Game of Thrones author George RR Martin wrote online that he had never heard back about panels he had proposed.\nInstead he was directed to filling in forms the same as any other applicant.\nHowever the range of panels that are going ahead at the SEC campus will cover a huge amount of topics.\nThis can be straightforward in scope, such as discussions marking anniversaries of films (including sci-fi adventure Stargate and Sean Connery's cult classic Zardoz) or examinations of serious issues, like the growth of artificial intelligence.\nThen there are more off-the wall items , from Deliciously Evil: Villain Romances and Why We Love Them to The Many Legs of SF: Creepy Crawlies in Space and Best Cats of SFF, where a panel will discuss \"their favourite felines.\" \nA major event comes on Thursday night with Morrow's Isle - a libretto written by Scottish author Ken MacLeod about a secretive scientific project on the Clyde, and featuring musicians from the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.\n\"One of the things that we were really keen on doing was making sure this was a Scottish Worldcon,\" adds Esther, who grew up reading sci-fi greats like Doris Lessing and Arthur C Clarke. \n\"So we have partnered with local groups like Glasgow University, we're holding outreach events in libraries and we\u2019ve got Scottish language items in the programme.\n\"There are items on Iain M Banks and Alasdair Gray and on integrating Scottishness into sci-fi writing. Worldcon hasn\u2019t been in the UK for 10 years so we had a lot to choose from with ideas.\"       \nAccording to Tendai, that also reflects how strong the current Scottish science fiction scene is.\n\"There is a very strong community here so this is a great time for Scottish sci-fi,\" he says.\n\"You have groups like the Edinburgh Science Fiction and Fantasy group, where writers meet up regularly. It is usually at the early stages of their career, and then over time you start to see some of them getting published. It's a fabulous space [for writers].\"\nLast year's Worldcon was held in Chengdu in China, a decision that sparked considerable protests among writers and fans in protest at the country's treatment of Uyghurs.\nFor this year's event Esther - a professor of game studies at Staffordshire University - says organisers wanted to place inclusion at the heart of the convention.\n\"There is a big trend in science fiction at the moment towards science fiction that is very kind and very thoughtful,\" she says. \n\"Someone like Becky Chambers is a good example.

    "A group of farmers have said that direct sales to the public were crucial to the viability of their businesses.\nKatrina and Richard Hirst from Ormesby St Margaret, Norfolk, Emma and Charlie Tacon from Rollesby, near Great Yarmouth, and Erin and Robin Shreeve from Mautby, Norfolk, each own farm shops as well as produce crops and rear livestock.\nThey said that building shops enabled them to control prices and engage with customers over the process of producing locally grown and high-welfare foods, which has given them a greater income than working with large-scale markets. \nMr Hirst said his diversified businesses yield a greater profit than the arable side of his farm.\nThe Shreeves took up tenancy of a Norfolk County Council-owned county farm in Mautby in 2012.\nThe farm comprises of a cottage, buildings and 52 hectares (128 acres), which includes marshland to graze cattle and to grow 95% of the feed required for their micro dairy herd.\nMs Shreeve said: \"Without county farms, the reality is we wouldn't be farming, or if we were, it would be for someone else doing what they want.\n\"So having a council farm ourselves has given us the opportunity to do everything we wanted to do in farming and be our own bosses.\n\"We wouldn't be doing the dairy if we weren't selling [direct] from the farm, not just because of the raw milk but because of the scale that we can do it in.\n\"We have 12 cows to milk which to us is amazing as four years ago we started with two dairy cows.\n\"Now, we are doing cream, butter and ice cream and all these different things which gives us the opportunity to have these lovely animals.\"\nThe couple, who have two daughters, aged three and five, also rent 31 hectares (76 acres) at Nova Scotia Farm in Caister, Norfolk, where Mr Shreeve began his farming career.\nThe couple graze 150 sheep and 160 lambs at foot, under a sheep-proof solar farm.\nMr Shreeve added: \"All the beef in [the farm shop] is from our own cattle, all of which are fed our own food. \n\"We grow it on the farm, we process it on the farm and that's something we are desperately proud of. \n\"It's so sustainable, there's no food miles in the meat whatsoever; it's food feet!\"\nEmma and Charlie Tacon grow soft fruits, green vegetables and root crops on their 80 hectares (198 acres) farm in Rollesby.\nThey sell direct through their farm shop but also supply other nearby farm shops and larger stores, such as Roys of Wroxham and the East of England Co-op.\nMs Tacon said if they focused on bulk sales of arable crops, she and her husband would have to take on second jobs to earn enough money to live comfortably.\nShe added: \"We would certainly need jobs off the farm if we grew commodity crops. It wouldn't be enough to sustain us.\n\"We're a relatively small farm so in order to make a sufficient income we had to supply something a bit different, rather than just wheat and sugar beet.\"\nShe said running their farm was labour-intensive, owing to the picking and packing of perishable crops, and it employs around eight people year round and additional seasonal staff. \n\"In order to retain some control over our prices we actively chose not to supply the big supermarkets, but keep control over our end price by supplying other local farm shops, our own farm shop and larger regional businesses such as Roys or East of England Co-op, where we can have a fair discussion about price.\n\"We've always got that peace of mind that we can have a sensible conversation with our customers, be that the farm shop down the road or the East of England Co-op, who understand and want our business to survive, so we work together.\n\"While the price has to be sensible so that the customer is happy, we can work together to achieve our common goals.\"\nRichard Hirst at Ormesby Farms 400 hectares (988 acres), which produces cereals, sugar beet, potatoes and salads. He also rears sheep, cattle and pigs.\nHe has diversified the business and now operates a horse riding livery, a farm shop and caf\u00e9 as well as a farming-themed tourist attraction.\nHe said: \"The fun park we started in 2007 or 2008 when crop prices were very low and we wanted to do something different. \n\"We have a captive audience from tourists here, so we thought we'd give that a go and it's been a very successful diversification.\n\"We started serving our own beef and lamb burgers at the fun park but there was a lot of meat we were leaving with the butcher, so we thought we might as well start selling that ourselves, so we started the farm shop and then developed the caf\u00e9.\"\nHe added: \"The turnover of those three [diversified businesses] is more than the arable farm business.\n\"We are also employing a lot more people now. When I came back to the farm in the early 1980s we had ten people working on the farm. \n\"We are now down to one [on the farm] with my son Robert and I, but [at peak season] we've got 30 people on the books with the shop, caf\u00e9 and fun park, so the balance has changed completely as to where the employment is now.\"\nFollow Nor",
    "Thousands of students will be either rejoicing or despairing today as they receive their A-level results. But one high achiever tells BBC News that it was personal motivation, self-belief and hard work that propelled her to the top spot of a mental health charity.\nSarah Hughes remembers results day like it was yesterday, even though it was nearly 30 years ago when she found out she would be entering clearing to get into her chosen university and undergraduate course.\n\"I was crushed,\" said the 49-year-old, who is originally from London but now living in Cambridgeshire.\n\"I was with my dad and sat on the sofa next to him. And I opened the results. It was a very scary 48 hours after that.\"\nUnfortunately for Sarah, her A-level results of BCD fell short of the BCC she needed to automatically enrol onto the University of Hull's social policy and social work course. \n\"It was devastating,\" she recalled. \"My dad did a great job of making me feel better, but nonetheless it was tricky.\n\"So I went into clearing for my course, really kind of praying that I would get through.\"\nShe said she was \"anxious and worried\" over the ensuing days as she waited to find out if she would be accepted. She was.\nIt was the love and support of her family and friends that got her through those tricky few days, preventing her \"world from crashing in\", she said.\nSarah eventually secured a place after convincing the university that she was passionate about the course.\nShe said she struggled with exams but added that she \"just kept going\". \n\"I failed GCSE maths twice. I'm somebody who is not incredibly academic, but I just wanted to do my best and so I think that helps.\"\nClearing is available to students who do not meet the conditions of their offer on A-level results day, as well as those who did not receive any offers.\nHowever, prospective students who have changed their mind about what or where they wish to study, and those who have applied outside the normal application window, can also use it.\nAccording to Ucas, which runs the clearing process, in 2021 there were 24,465 18-year-olds who entered clearing because they either did not meet the terms of their university offer, or had \u201cself-released into the system\".\nIn 2022, that figure rose to 33,145. In 2023, it was 37,555.\nThirty years after receiving her grades, Sarah is now sitting in the top seat of Mind, having been made the charity's chief executive in 2023.\nShe said she had known since the age of 18 that she wanted to lead the mental health charity and it was \"keeping [her] eyes on the prize\", along with support from family, friends and tutors, that got her there.\n\"From a very young age I knew that I wanted to work in the field of health and social care,\" said Sarah, who has worked in a chief executive role at a number of other organisations.\nIn July, Sarah was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Hull for services to mental health, which she described as being \"wild and humbling\".\n\"It was wonderful. One of the biggest honours of my life.\n\"I was just like 'oh my gosh, I can't believe it'.\"\nCasting her mind back to her late teens, Sarah said she \"wouldn't have believed\" she would have got this far and encouraged people to see the bigger picture.\n\"It's a big day, but it isn't the rest of your life,\" she said.  \n\"I've had a great career but I still haven't got maths GCSE.\"\nNow she's reached the top, what advice does she have for budding CEOs?\n\"It's having a vision and believing you're capable of it and believing in yourself. But at the same time drawing on your networks, letting people help you, trying and failing at things. \n\"I haven't been successful at everything I've done. I think the first thing is follow your passion.\"\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "When Friends actor Matthew Perry was found dead in a hot tub at his Los Angeles home last year, it seemed like it could have just been an accident. \nHe had been treating depression with ketamine - and no foul play was expected. \nHowever, the arrest of five people including medical doctors, Perry's assistant and an alleged dealer US prosecutors have described as the \"Ketamine Queen\", has shed light on an alleged vast ketamine-dealing underground network, cover-up attempts - and another death, too.\nDr Salvador Plasencia - one of those accused of supplying the actor with ketamine -  allegedly called him \"a moron\" and wondered how much to charge him for the drug - eventually, more than 165 times its price, according to prosecutors.\nAlleged dealer Jasveen Sangha's name comes up again and again in the investigation.\nAuthorities allege the \"Ketamine Queen\" supplied the drugs that led to Perry's death on 28 October 2023. \nThe 41-year-old is accused of selling 50 vials of ketamine to him for about $11,000 (\u00a38,550) and is described by prosecutors as a drug trafficker who knew the ketamine she distributed could be deadly.\nHer North Hollywood home was a \"drug-selling emporium\", Martin Estrada, the US attorney for California's Central District, said.\nMore than 80 vials of ketamine were allegedly found there in a search, along with thousands of pills that included methamphetamine, cocaine and Xanax. \nA handgun was also discovered, Mr Estrada said. \nThe home, called the \"Sangha Stash House\" in the indictment, was where she is alleged to have packaged and distributed drugs, mostly for the rich and famous.\nMs Sangha \"only deal[s] with high end and celebs\", according to the indictment.\nMr Estrada alleged she was a \"major source of supply for ketamine to others as well as Perry\". \nAs Perry fell deeper into addiction, he wanted more and more ketamine and sought it for lower prices, which led him to street dealers as well as the more elite providers, authorities said. \nThose charged in the case took advantage of him, Mr Estrada said. \nDr Plasencia wrote in one text message that he wanted to be Perry's \"go-to for drugs\".\nIn another, he wrote: \"I wonder how much this moron will pay?\".\nIt is alleged that Perry paid them around $2,000 for vials that actually cost about $12 a piece. \n\u201cThese defendants cared more about profiting off of Mr Perry than caring for his well-being,\u201d said Mr Estrada. \nAuthorities say Perry purchased 20 vials of ketamine from Dr Plasencia for a total of $55,000 between September and October 2023.  \nDr Plasencia also allegedly taught Kenneth Iwamasa, the actor's live-in assistant, how to inject the drug, even though he had learned \"that Perry\u2019s ketamine addiction was spiralling out of control\", according to investigators. \nAuthorities say the doctor provided more ketamine even though he witnessed Perry \"freeze up\" while administering the drug on one occasion.\nFollowing Perry's death, those accused of supplying him with the drugs attempted to hide their actions, investigators say. \nAuthorities say Ms Sangha sent a message to another suspect telling him to \"delete all our messages\".\nEric Fleming, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute drugs unlawfully, is alleged to have messaged Ms Sangha: \u201cPlease call... Got more info and want to bounce ideas off you. I\u2019m 90% sure everyone is protected. I never dealt with [Perry] only his assistant. So the assistant was the enabler.\"\nHe also asked Ms Sangha, according to court documents, whether ketamine stays \"in your system or is it immediately flushed out\".\nAuthorities say they used coded language, calling ketamine  \"Dr Pepper\", \"bots\" or \"cans\".\nDr Plasencia allegedly falsified medical records in an attempt to make the drugs given to the actor look legitimate.\nAuthorities also uncovered that Ms Sangha was allegedly tied to another overdose death in 2019.\nAccording to court documents, she knew about the dangers of ketamine after selling it to a customer named Cody McLaury, who died of an overdose after buying the drug.\nOne of his family members is said to have texted her saying: \"The ketamine you sold my brother killed him. It's listed as the cause of death.\"\nDays later, investigators say, Ms Sangha searched on Google: \"Can ketamine be listed as a cause of death?\"\nAuthorities say Ms Sangha will face charges in that case.\nIwamasa, Perry's live-in assistant, was the person who found the actor dead.\nInvestigators say he was also the one who injected Perry with the ketamine that led to his death. \nIwamasa never received medical training and \"knew little, if anything\" about administering controlled substances, according to court documents. \nIn the four days leading up to and including Perry's death, prosecutors say Iwamasa administered more than 20 shots of ketamine, three on the day the actor died.\nHe was charged in July with one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine resulting in death and serious bodily injury. Prosecutors say he has since pleaded guilty to the c",

    "Swimmers who secured designated bathing water status at a beach have been awarded for their campaigning efforts.\nManningtree beach in Essex was named among 27 new sites in England by the Environment Agency (EA) in May.\nIt followed extensive lobbying by the Manningtree Mermaids, who have now been named winners of the David Wood National Landscape Award for 2024.\n\"It is really brilliant news,\" said Helen Whitehead, from the wild swimming group.\n\"Manningtree beach is really popular, it's the heart of our town.\"\nThe award is presented to those who have made an outstanding contribution to the Suffolk & Essex Coast and Heaths National Landscape, formerly known as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\nThe Mermaids swim regularly in the Stour Estuary and membership has grown to more than 150 people.\nMembers launched the SWIM campaign in February 2023, which called for Manningtree beach to get designated bathing water status.\nAfter engaging with Anglian Water and undertaking wide public consultation, the beach was awarded the status in May.\nIt meant the EA would monitor the water quality on a weekly basis between May and September, over a five-year period.\nMs Whitehead said the recognition was an \"amazing\" moment.\n\"It was a real vindication of all the work we'd done. It reflected what an amazing community Manningtree is because so many people supported us,\" she said.\nThe group was not aware it had been nominated for an award, Ms Whitehead added.\n\"It makes it really worthwhile. Someone has noticed all the hours we put in and it's so lovely to be recognised for that.\"\nNick Collinson, chairman of the region's National Landscape group, said the Mermaids' work would have a \"long-term, positive impact\" on the estuary.\nHe said the award recognised the \"selfless hard work and dedication of incredible volunteers\".\n\"The Manningtree Mermaids have brought together a community to enjoy swimming and spending time outdoors,\" Mr Collinson added.\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "The safety of women has been gaining more attention in recent years following a number of high-profile murders like that of Sarah Everard, Zara Aleena and Kulsuma Akter.\nIn Leeds, a \u201csafe space bus\u201d was launched in 2022 to help support women on nights out, but its future is uncertain due to a lack of funding. To find out more about its work BBC News spent a Saturday night with staff on board the bus.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve probably stopped so many assaults happening without even knowing, just by providing a safe place for women to wait for taxis,\" Emily Taylor tells me.\nShe is one of the support workers on the Women's Night Safe Space Bus that is parked next to the Corn Exchange, close to the bars and clubs in Leeds city centre, every Saturday night.\nThe vehicle is stocked with medical equipment, drinks, snacks and essentials like tampons, mobile phone chargers, fluffy socks and flip flops for aching feet.\n\u201cWe have everything,\u201d Ms Taylor tells me.\n\u201cWe have women who come here who\u2019ve been assaulted, we have women who may feel vulnerable and unsafe, they might have lost their phone and friends, they might have been spiked.\u201d\nIt is 21:00 BST and the bars on nearby Call Lane are filling up, as loud music pumps out of doorways and groups of people spill out into the street, hugging friends as they move from one bar to the next.\nDespite the occasional summer rain shower, the crowds on the street appear happy with people smiling and laughing as they queue to get inside the bars.\nSome of the women, though, tell me that safety is something they always have to take into account.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to think about who you\u2019re with and making sure that you feel safe with someone,\u201d one woman says.\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have to be like that, you shouldn\u2019t have to think twice before you come out but you do unfortunately and it is a shame.\u201d\nAnother group of women moving through the crowds between bars on Lower Briggate tell me they always keep an eye on their drinks on a night out.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been spiked myself and I\u2019ve had friends who have been spiked as well,\u201d one of them says.\nSafe Space Bus staff chat to the women as they move through the city\u2019s streets on one of their regular walks, checking for anyone who might need their help.\nSince the service was launched in November 2022, it says 2,116 women have been helped.\nOf those women, 51 accessed support for domestic abuse, 49 received medical assistance to help avoid an A&E admission and 38 were supported to make reports to police.\nOlivia Boothroyd from Bevan Healthcare is the practice nurse on board the bus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sometimes quite overwhelming out there, so people can just sit and have a bit of a calm space,\u201d she says.\nMs Boothroyd often treats minor injuries, especially from broken glass, but also supports the women who come to the bus and may be feeling unsafe and vulnerable.\n\u201cObviously they\u2019re looking at all the posters we have up and that triggers conversations, and sometimes people notice things and they want to chat,\" she says.\n\"It\u2019s an opportunity to talk about anything.\"\nThe bus staff say there have been occasions where women have come to the vehicle just to charge a phone or have a cup of tea or drink of water, and have then made a disclosure of abuse.\nWomen\u2019s Night Safe Space coordinator Shreena Gobey believes the bus is in the right place at the right time.\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t expecting us to be there,\u201d she tells me.\n\u201cBy being available in this unique opportunity as part of a night out, that support is unlike anything else that I know of in this city or have heard of elsewhere.\u201d\nDuring the night, the staff help a woman who has lost her friends and suffered a head injury.\nThey also support a woman who explains she is a survivor of childhood abuse.\nThe service is run by Women Friendly Leeds and the Safer Leeds Partnership, but funding is currently due to run out at the end of September.\n\u201cWe are doing everything we can to fight for funding but we are really struggling at this point,\u201d Ms Taylor says.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not been a single night where I\u2019ve thought we weren\u2019t needed here tonight for something really important and I think without this service Leeds as a city will suffer.\u201d\nAs the night continues, more hot drinks and bottles of water are handed out while mobile phones are charged and women wait for taxis home.\nIn the recent King\u2019s Speech, the new Labour government announced legislation, including the Crime and Policing Bill, which would include measures to ensure an improved police response to violence against women and girls and spiking.\nWest Yorkshire Police has described the Night Safe Space as a \u201cfantastic project.\u201d\nTemporary Ch Insp Natasha Tierney from Leeds District Partnerships says the service supports the work of the police, adding: \"It is a brilliant example of the important role that projects like this can play in making Leeds a safer place.\u201d\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "\u201cWhy did the politician bring a ladder to the debate? To make sure he could reach new heights with his promises!\u201d\nAsk AI to write a political joke, and the above is an example of what you can get.\nPerhaps not funny enough to deliver on stage in front of a paying audience, but that doesn\u2019t mean there is no room for AI in comedy.\nComedians are increasingly experimenting with the technology to write scripts and brainstorm ideas, including Anesti Danelis. Earlier this year, the Canadian asked popular AI chatbot ChatGPT to write him a show.\nThe result is what he has been performing throughout this summer, including at this month\u2019s Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\nThe BBC sat down with Anesti after his sixth performance in seven days at the Toronto Fringe Theatre Festival in July. He explained the writing process behind his show \u201cArtificially Intelligent\u201d.\n\u201cI was playing around with ChatGPT, and the results it gave me were terribly hilarious, and I thought \u2018maybe there's a show in this?\u2019.\u201d\nDespite some rubbish jokes, he says the tool was useful for brainstorming.\n\u201cI asked it to \u2018write me five songs about bisexual dilemmas\u2019, or \u2018being an immigrant child\u2019, and it gave me ideas that I would have never thought of.\u201d\nWhat he wasn\u2019t expecting from AI was its understanding of how to devise a show.\n\u201cI told it to make me a running order, and it explained where every song should go and why, and it made total sense. I was surprised by how much it could explain the reasoning behind it.\u201d\nDespite using the technology to write chunks of the script, Anesti\u2019s show very much relies on his delivery. Throughout the performance the comedian switches from a keyboard to a guitar to deliver songs and monologues. There\u2019s lots of interaction, including a serenading of an audience member, with a song written about them by ChatGPT.\nReflecting on the experience, Anesti says: \"I learned through the process that human creativity can't be replicated or replaced, and in the end about 20% of the show was pure AI, and the other 80% was a mix.\u201d\nSo far, he says, he has only had good feedback from audience members, including Olivia Smith and Bethany Radford, who both live in Toronto.\nOlivia admits she\u2019s sceptical of AI, but enjoyed seeing it played with creatively.\n\u201cI think I'd feel a little cheated out of an experience if the entire thing was written by technology, but it was funny seeing AI on stage because it was creative,\u201d she says.\nBethany, who is an actor, agrees, and says: \u201cThere is a place for AI in creation and writing so long as it\u2019s transparent that it\u2019s been part of the process.\u201d\nA recently released study from the University of Southern California found that AI-generated jokes outperform those crafted by human beings. Bethany, however, is not so sure, and feels \u201chumans are pretty good at sniffing out AI\u201d.\nIf she is watching something, she adds: \u201cI feel like I know when the writing had no human involved. But I'm sure that will change as it gets smarter.\u201d\nMaking audiences laugh is big business, and over the past decade the stand-up comedy market in the US has almost tripled in terms of the combined value of tickets sold. That is according to data from trade publication Pollstar, which monitors the live performance sector. It says US comedy ticket sales hit $900m (\u00a3700m) in 2023, up from $371m in 2012. \nMeanwhile, a separate study last month said that live comedy was now worth more than \u00a31bn a year to the UK economy. This figure includes not just ticket sales, but also the revenues of comedy venues and festivals, and the positive impact on the wider local economies.\nUS comedian Viv Ford is also performing at this month\u2019s Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\nHer show is called \u201cNo Kids On The Blockchain\u201d, and details her time living with \u201c14 tech-loving crypto [currency] bros in San Francisco\u201d.\nThough she wrote the show herself, she explains she tested her material on ChatGPT.\n\"I'll say, \u2018hey, is this joke funny?\u2019. And if it says \u2018it\u2019s funny\u2019, genuinely, it does not land with an audience,\u201d says Viv. \u201cBut if it says a joke \u2018is offensive\u2019 it does so well.\n\u201cAnd sometimes ChatGPT will say \u2018the joke is fine, but could use some work\u2019, in which case I toss it away and start again.\u201d\nViv knows that lots of people won\u2019t be so embracing of AI in the arts. It\u2019s a view she used to take until she lived in San Francisco, where so many tech firms are based.\n\u201cI'm so aware that the only reason I think this way is because of my four-year indoctrination in the school of San Francisco,\u201d she says. \u201cI realised AI can be your weapon, just like Google can be your weapon. If you know how to use AI correctly, you are unstoppable.\u201d\nNot everyone in the comedy world is keen to try AI though, including Kiwi-Filipino comedian James Roque. He says it doesn\u2019t fit with his approach to humour.\n\u201cMy belief and ethos is that the best comedy is the kind that is deeply human and vulnerable, and AI couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he says.\nMr Roque is also performing at Edinburgh this month, and he thinks audience",
    "One of the oldest ferries in CalMac's fleet is to be withdrawn from service in November before being scrapped and parts of it recycled.\nIslay's MV Hebridean Isles is 38 years old and has required lengthy and costly repairs - including last year when it was out of action for 10 months.\nIt was removed from service on Thursday for investigations into a problem with its bow thruster, but CalMac said this issue was not linked to the decision to scrap it.\nThe first of two new ferries for Islay - MV Isle of Islay - is due to enter service later this year and the second in early 2025.\nThe ship was built by the Cochrane shipyard in Selby, North Yorkshire, and given a spectacular sideways launch into the River Ouse in July 1985. \nIt was the first CalMac ship built outside Scotland, with bagpipers sent for the ceremony attended by the Duchess of Kent. \nNicknamed Heb Isles, the ferry has in the past operated a freight run between Ullapool-Stornoway, was used between Ardrossan and Brodick and served the Uig Triangle and Oban-Lochboisdale route.\nIn its lifetime it was also chartered by NorthLink Ferries for several winters in the early 2000s, providing relief on its Stromness to Scrabster service.\nCalMac's fleet management director Craig Ramsay said: \"MV Hebridean Isles\u2019 planned disposal marks the latest step in a period of significant change for CalMac, which will see the rapid modernisation of our fleet of major vessels by 2026.\n\"If the Heb Isles were to be retained, she would require a significant programme of work in overhaul due to her age and general condition and this would keep her out of service for months.\"\nHe added: \"Vessels become a part of the fabric of the island communities they serve, and CalMac colleagues and islanders, particularly on Islay, will be sorry to see the Heb Isles exit the fleet after a long period of service. \n\"That\u2019s why we are keen to mark her departure in some form come November.\"\nHeb Isles will be taken to a recycling facility after it is withdrawn from service.\nThe ship is currently the second-oldest large ship in the CalMac fleet, after MV Isle of Arran which is 40 years old but still serving the route after which was named. \nThe oldest vessel is the small ferry Isle of Cumbrae, which is now nearly 48 years old.

    "A senior police officer has announced plans for a large policing operation ahead of any potential protests this weekend.\nSpt Lisa Simpson said there would be more than 200 officers on standby in Yeovil, Somerset, to provide reassurance, facilitate any peaceful protest and \"deal robustly\" with any disorder on Saturday.\nSupt Simpson said she knew there was concern in the town about posts on social media and wanted people \"to feel safe and be free to go about their lives without fear\".\nShe added officers had \"no firm evidence\" of a planned demonstration, but remained \"committed to keeping people updated\".\nThe operation will involve mostly local officers, but back-up units will be brought in from neighbouring police forces and further afield, Avon and Somerset Police said.\nMounted, dog and drone units will be in the area to join officers if needed, the force added.\nSpt Simpson said: \u201cGiven the scenes we have all witnessed take place in towns and cities across the country in recent days, we feel it is proportionate to stand up this operation.\n\u201cThose who live and work in Yeovil, or who are planning on visiting this weekend, should not be alarmed by the large number of police - they are there to keep you safe.\"\nShe added that police has been in regular contact with community and faith leaders, as well as local businesses, to keep them informed and offer advice. \nSpt Simpson said boarding up businesses or avoiding the town centre was not something police would ever advise on, but the force would keep the public updated so people could make \"their own informed decisions\".\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s by working closely with our communities that we will ensure those who threaten to cause unrest will not succeed.\u201d\nJulie Turner, who manages the Emporium on Princes Street in Yeovil, said she was prepared for any potential protests, but would trade as normal. \n\"Our main priority is our customers and our staff, if anything kicks off - shutters down and we're all safe inside. \n\"It's good to be prepared.\"\nNick Evans from Barolo Lounge, based on the corner of King George Street and High Street, said Saturday would be \"business as usual\" and he thought the rumours of the protest were \"a storm in a teacup\".\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Dozens of arrests have been made as disorder following the Southport knife attack spread to different parts of the country.\nMore than 100 people were arrested in central London on Wednesday evening as officers clashed with protesters on Whitehall during a demonstration.\nUnrest also broke out in Hartlepool, where eight people were arrested, several officers were injured and a police car was set on fire.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer met with senior police leaders on Thursday to offer them his \"full backing\".\nEarlier, a 17-year-old boy appeared in court, charged with murdering three girls and attempting to murder eight other children and two adults in Monday's knife attack. He was named as Axel Muganwa Rudakubana. \nDal Babu, former Ch Supt and firearms commander in the Met, has blamed the disorder on the \"reckless\" spread of misinformation about the identity of the suspect charged in the stabbing. \nSpeaking on BBC R4's Today Programme, Mr Babu said the police have taken the \"unprecedented\" decision to confirm the suspect \"was born in this country\". \nIn London, demonstrators were seen launching flares towards the gates of Downing Street and at a statue of Winston Churchill.\nPeople could be heard chanting phrases such as \"stop the boats\" and \"save our kids\" as they threw bottles and cans at officers.\nEarlier, the Met said conditions placed on the protest had been breached.\nThe Met said it made arrests for a range of offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker and breach of protest conditions on Wednesday evening.\nIn a statement, the Met said officers were deployed to \"ensure disorder was contained\" and that some \"suffered minor injuries\".\nSeveral officers were also injured in Hartlepool after violence broke out in the town, Cleveland Police said. \nEight people were arrested in relation to public order offences after glass bottles and eggs were thrown at police by protesters. A police car was also set on fire.\nCh Supt David Sutherland said of the Cleveland arrests: \"At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week.\"\nThe force said they \"expect further arrests to be made in the coming days\". \nDisorder was also reported in Aldershot. Local MP Alex Baker said a peaceful protest \"descended into intimidating behaviour\" at a hotel in the Hampshire town.\n\"This incident was exacerbated by people from outside our community who came here determined to cause unrest,\" she said. \n\"We all support our shared right to peacefully protest, but we will not stand for people coming to our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide our community.\"\nIn Manchester, two men were arrested for violent disorder and assaulting an emergency worker.\nGreater Manchester Police said protesters were dispersed in the Newton Heath area after \"objects were thrown towards the police and public\". \nWednesday's disorder followed unrest near a mosque in Southport on Tuesday night, during which the building was attacked. \nMerseyside Police officers were also pelted with bricks and a police van was set on fire.\nThe unrest came after Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday while attending a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport.\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in a critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt.\nOn Thursday, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust announced two of the injured children had been discharged. \nFive children are still being treated by the hospital and are \"currently in a stable condition\", Alder Hey said.\n17-year-old Rudakubana has been charged with three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article.\nHe appeared at Liverpool City Magistrates' Court on Thursday morning and later at Liverpool Crown Court. He was remanded into youth detention accommodation until 25 October, when a pre-trial preparation hearing will take place.\nThe teenager was previously not named because of his age, but Recorder of Liverpool Judge Andrew Menary KC ruled during the hearing that his identity could be made public. \nThe judge said this was \"principally\" because the defendant turns 18 on 7 August and legal restrictions protecting his anonymity would have ended then. He added: \"Continuing to prevent full reporting at this stage has a disadvantage of allowing others up to mischief to continue to spread misinformation in a vacuum.\"\nMerseyside Police have confirmed that the defendant was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, that he appears to have no known links to Islam, and that they are not currently investigating the attack as terror-related. \nIn Downing Street on Thursday, prime minister Sir Keir Starmer told police chiefs they were meeting in the shadow of the \"horrific attack in Southport\". \n\"Our first thoughts are obviously with the victims, their families and the wider community who are in raw pain and grief",
    "More than 250 jobs are at risk at Natural Resources Wales (NRW) as the government environment agency tries to reduce its staff budget by \u00a313m. \nIt said three visitor centres may close as it focuses on making sure activities that impact nature, climate, and minimising pollution are prioritised. \nA 45-day staff and unions consultation is underway and NRW said it would try to reduce redundancies.\nAn NRW spokesperson said: \"The aim is to mitigate job losses as much as possible\".\nNRW sent an email to staff on Wednesday telling them of the plan to reduce the staff budget by 1 April 2025. \nVisitor centre Coed y Brenin near Dolgellau, Gwynedd and Nant yr Arian and Ynyslas centres, near Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, will close at the end of March 2025 if the changes are made. \nThe organisation said that \"this has put all staff at all VCs (visitor centres) at risk of redundancy from today, subject to the future outcome of the consultation. Trails, access, carparks, and toilets would all continue on site.\" \nIt said a \"meaningful consultation\" was under way with trade unions but the proposal would remove 265 posts. \n\"The purpose is to refocus resources on the activities that will have the most impact on nature, climate, and minimising pollution, as well as the statutory work that only NRW can do,\" it said.\n\"The aim is to mitigate job losses as much as possible. Some of these changes, if implemented, will impact our partners, customers, and stakeholders.\"\nA community group, Caru Coed y Brenin, whose members hope to be given the chance to run the mountain bike visitor centre at Coed y Brenin, will meet NRW officials on Friday, but it seems unlikely any firm decision or commitment about the future of the site will be made then.\nNRW chief executive Clare Pillman said: \"Public funding is exceptionally tight across the whole of the UK.\"\n\"We are having to look across all of our remit and critically review what we can and must continue to do, what we stop, and what we slow or do differently.\"",
    "Ministers are urging insurance firms to pay out quickly to businesses damaged by last week's rioting.\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC he had written to the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to make sure companies \"receive the cover that they are entitled to through their insurance policies as swiftly as possible\".\nBusinesses including shops and hotels in Stockport, Liverpool, Hull, Sunderland and Belfast have seen windows or facades smashed in or set on fire by rioters while some have reported looting.\nThe ABI said it would \"work with our members, the government, and other stakeholders, to do everything we can to help customers recover as quickly as possible\".\nMr Reynolds said that he had visited Liverpool on Friday where he spoke to some small business owners affected by the violence. \n\"They weren\u2019t aware if they were insured or under insured that there was still help available to them,\" he said.\nSo what help is available for businesses and, if you are insured, what does your policy cover?\nMost commercial insurance policies will cover companies for damage to their premises caused by civil unrest. Direct Line, for example, says it \"includes insurance cover for riot as standard under its business insurance policies\".\nMost will also include \"interruption to business operations\". This would be, for instance, if police cordoned off an area which stopped shoppers from entering a store, resulting in a loss of income for the firm.\nBusinesses should always check with their insurer as soon as possible to see exactly what is covered under their policy.\nOwners should also report any damage to the police to get a crime reference number for a claim.\nIf your company is in Northern Ireland, the ABI says: \"Policies will vary but malicious damage may be excluded.\" It says compensation can be sought from the Department of Justice (Northern Ireland).\nMeanwhile, if your vehicle has been vandalised during the riots, \"most comprehensive motor insurance also includes cover for damage to your car\", according to the ABI.\nYes, you can - through the Riot Compensation Act (RCA).\nMr Reynolds said: \"It covers damage, destruction and theft of stock from things like looting.\"\nYou must be able to demonstrate that the damage you are claiming for is because of a riot.\nIf you're not insured or underinsured, the Riot Compensation Act is a good option.\nThe government states that businesses have 42 days to make a claim through the RCA from the date the riot ends. \nEven if you are covered - and your insurer decides not to pay out for all or part of your claim - you can apply to the RCA. \nYou have 42 days to make a claim from the date your insurer tells you that you're not covered.\nThere are a number of things you can claim for.\nIf, for example, you own the building affected by a riot you can claim for damage to the structure. If you are the tenant or occupier, you can seek compensation for damaged or stolen contents.\nThe government also says that owners can claim for damaged or stolen business items stored in a vehicle and underinsured vehicles.\nCompensation may be in money or repairs carried out by the claims authority's expense.\nWhich brings us to how to claim.

    "Preserving a derelict 1850s pub is \"simply not a practical option\", developers have said.\nWestwise Development Ltd has submitted proposals to Westmorland and Furness Council to demolish the former Queens Arms pub on Rawlinson Street in Barrow and build a three-storey, 21-unit apartment block.\nObjectors said the building was \"historical\" and should not be pulled down.\nBut the developers said replacing the building was \"the only way to put the site back into beneficial use\".\nThe Queens Arms opened in 1853 and was a popular live music venue before closing in 2008.\nDevelopers said it was initially hoper the pub could be converted into a residential building, but it was found the scheme was not \"economically viable\".\n\"Unfortunately, preserving the existing building is simply not a practical option,\" they said.\n\"Much as the applicant would have liked to preserve the existing building, the reality is that the only way to put the site back into beneficial use is to demolish the existing building and replace it with a high-quality modern building.\"\nPlanning documents also stated there had been \"ongoing problems with vandalism and theft of building materials\" and the building's condition had deteriorated \"beyond economic repair\".\nThe proposed apartment block would consist of 18 one-bedroom and three two-bedroom flats, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nObjectors said the building was part of Barrow\u2019s heritage.\nOne of those against the plans said: \"The brilliant red architecture is from a time when Barrow was the powerhouse of the world. \n\"There are very few of these buildings left in Barrow and this one should be allowed to stand for the heritage of our town.\"\nPlans for the apartment block were previously withdrawn in October 2023 after councillors were told it was a \"generally uninspiring and bland design\".\nThe developer said the new application included changes to the exterior of the building and was of \"higher quality\" than the previous scheme.\nThe plans are currently the subject of a public consultation.\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Images of the Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwan\u2019s Lin Yu-ting on the medal podium in Paris will go down as some of the most unforgettable of the 2024 Olympics.\nA frenzied debate has raged over the International Olympic Committee clearing the duo to compete in the women's boxing in Paris, despite them having been disqualified from last year's Women's World Championships for failing to meet eligibility criteria.\nAmid the heat, science is shedding increasing light on our different chromosomal make-ups and what advantages they may bring to sport.\nBut the research is ongoing and even among the experts who spend their professional lives working on it, there are differing interpretations on what the science tells us.\nWe do know that the process of sex determination starts when a foetus is developing. Most females get two X chromosomes (XX), while most males get an X and a Y chromosome (XY).\nChromosomes influence a person's sex.  But hormones are important too, before birth - as well as later on during puberty. While the baby is still growing in the womb, hormones help the reproductive organs develop.\nHowever, at some point through the pregnancy some babies\u2019 reproductive organs don\u2019t develop in the way most people's do.\nThis can be caused by conditions called DSDs: differences in sex development.\nListen to Sofia read this article\nThere are a group of about 40 conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs that develop in the womb. It means a person's sex development is different from that of most other people's.\nThese chromosome abnormalities are rare - but they have come into sharp focus because of the boxing row at the Olympics.\nBoth fighters were said to have failed International Boxing Association gender eligibility tests last year \u2013 but there has been conflicting information whether XY chromosomes or elevated testosterone were found.\nWhile representatives of the fighters and the IOC insist the fighters were \u201cborn women, raised as women and always competed as women\u201d, critics, including some of their opponents at Paris 2024, have speculated that perhaps the fighters have DSD.\nBecause these genetic variations are so many and so varied, some experts say it\u2019s impossible to establish that everyone with a Y chromosome is a male and everyone without a Y chromosome is a female.\n\u201cJust looking at the presence of a Y chromosome on its own does not answer the question of whether someone is male or female,\u201d says Prof Alun Williams, who researches genetic factors related to sport performance at the Manchester Metropolitan University Institute of Sport.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a very good marker, as most people with a Y chromosome are male\u2026but it\u2019s not a perfect indicator.\u201d\nFor some people with DSD, the Y chromosome is not a fully formed typical male Y chromosome. It may have some genetic material missing, damaged or swapped with the X chromosome, depending on the variation.\nWhen it comes to being male or female, what is usually crucial is a specific gene called SRY - which stands for \u2018sex-determining region of the Y chromosome\u2019.\n\u201cThis is what is called the make-male gene. It\u2019s the master switch of sex development,\u201d says Dr Emma Hilton, a developmental biologist who studies genetic disorders. She is also a trustee of the Sex Matters charity, which argues Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting shouldn\u2019t be competing until further testing is done.\nThere are some people born with XY chromosomes who have lost what Dr Hilton calls the \"make-male\" gene.\n\u201cThese people don\u2019t make testosterone. They develop a very typical female anatomy,\u201d Dr Hilton says.\nSo a test that identifies XY chromosomes does not offer a complete picture. And in the case of Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, the IBA has not disclosed details of the way they were tested.\nHowever, Dr Hilton also says that in most people with DSD who have XY chromosomes, the SRY \"make-male\" gene is present.\nThese people usually have testicles which are often inside the body.\n\u201cWhen they hit puberty they start producing testosterone - which is what underpins male advantage in sports,\" says Dr Hilton.\nThe most famous example is Caster Semenya - a double Olympic gold medallist and three-time world champion over 800m, though Prof Alun Williams says there is not direct evidence that DSD athletes have the same advantage as typical males.\nThe roadblock is in a gene required to generate external genitalia - which boys need in order to grow a penis. Anyone with the same condition as Caster Semenya has a mutation within that gene that stops it functioning normally.\nIn the womb, they will develop a male anatomy until the final stage of growing a penis - and when they are not able to, then they\u2019ll start developing a vulva and a clitoris.\nBut they don\u2019t develop female reproductive organs: they don\u2019t have a cervix or a uterus.\nThese people don\u2019t have periods and they can\u2019t get pregnant. Having sex with males can be difficult.\nDiscovering you have this kind of genetic mutation can be a shock.\n\u201cThe mo",

    "Ukraine says its forces are continuing their advance into Russian territory, moving forward in several directions.\nRussia's western border region of Kursk came under a surprise attack last week, leading Russian authorities to declare a state of emergency in the area.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had advanced 1-2 km further into Kursk since Wednesday morning, and had also captured 100 Russian soldiers. But Russia claims it has stopped any further advances.\nNow in its second week, this is Ukraine's deepest incursion into Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.\nThe amount of Russian territory seized is uncertain, with both countries making conflicting statements.\nA commander of the Chechen Akhmat special forces unit, Maj-Gen Apti Alaudinov told viewers on Russian state-controlled TV, Channel One, that Russian forces had almost \u201ccompletely blocked\u201d the Ukrainian military from advancing.\nBut in a video link to President Zelensky,  army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi stated Ukrainian troops were now fully in control of the Kursk border town of Sudzha. \nThe BBC is unable to independently verify this claim, but a Ukrainian television report filmed from within the town showed Ukrainian soldiers removing a Russian flag from a school.\nAmid Kyiv's claims of territorial gains, Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhy said they were not interested in \"taking over\" Russian territory.\n\"The sooner Russia agrees to restore a just peace... the sooner the raids by the Ukrainian defence forces into Russia will stop,\" he told reporters.\nIn an earlier meeting with government officials, Mr Zelensky said he would consider setting up \u201cmilitary commandants' offices\u201d in the region.\nOn Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk outlined plans for a \u201csecurity zone\u201d in Kursk, to protect Ukraine\u2019s borders.\nHer Telegram post said Ukraine would organise humanitarian aid for Russian civilians within the security zone, and open evacuation corridors to both Russia and Ukraine.\nYan Furtsev, a local official with Russia's liberal opposition party, Yabloko, said the situation in the Kursk region was \"tense\".\n\"Citizens that are leaving their homes are in a very difficult psychological situation,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, adding they were experiencing a lot of \"stress and sadness\". \nMr Furtsev said about 180,000 civilians needed to be evacuated. So far 121,000 had left, he said, with everyone needing basic essentials such as food and clothing.\nEarlier Russia declared a second state of emergency, this time in the neighbouring Belgorod region, where homes have been damaged in drone attacks and shelling.\nMoscow says that overnight it shot down 117 drones overnight, which mainly targeted four regions - Kursk, Voronezh, Belgorod and Nizhny Novgorod. \nLong-range drones were also fired at Russian airfields in Voronezh and Kursk, as well as Savasleyka and Borisoglebsk, Ukraine's security services told AFP.\nThe Ukrainian military quoted a secret service source as calling it a \"fun\" night at the airports overnight, in what was a specially planned operation.\nIn his first comments on the operation since it began, US President Joe Biden said that the offensive was \u201ccreating a real dilemma for Putin\".\nMeanwhile, various European allies have voiced their support for Ukraine.\nThe prime ministers of Finland and Estonia said they supported Ukraine's military operation in Kursk, while Latvia\u2019s foreign minister went a step further by saying Kyiv \u201chas the right\u201d to use Nato weapons on Russian territory.\nRussia's President Vladimir Putin had previously described this as a \"red line\".\nLast week, the German foreign ministry said Ukraine was entitled to self-defence which was \"not limited to its own territory\".",
    "Havering Council's leader said he would not \"shy away\" from supporting controversial plans for a data centre. \nIf approved, the proposed East Havering Data Centre would be the largest in Europe and would boost the local economy, the local authority said. \nThe data centre, planned to be built on greenbelt land at North Ockendon, north-east London, would consist of large networked computer servers, used by companies for data storage, processing and distribution. \nIan Pirie, from Havering Friends of the Earth, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) they felt \"stonewalled\" by the council.\nThe data centre is proposed to be built on 99 acres (40 hectares) of land, close to the Essex border.\nHavering Residents Association councillor Ray Morgon, leader of the council, said elected officials had to make \u201ctough decisions for the whole borough\u201d but he would not \u201cshy away from supporting a beneficial scheme\".\n\"These decisions are not easy but I am not shying away from declaring my support for a scheme that could be a catalyst to deliver local growth, new businesses, future job opportunities for Havering children, as well as food security, energy security and data sovereignty for our country,\" he said.\nThe council said the development could bring more than 1,000 new jobs. \nBut Havering Friends of the Earth and fellow residents groups, including North Ockendon Residents Association (Nora), are concerned about the facility - roughly the combined size of 214 football pitches - being built on greenbelt land. \nA Nora spokesperson said the application would \u201copen the floodgates\u201d, adding: \u201cWe now have a race to the bottom to turn Cranham, Upminster and North Ockendon from green belt and conservation area into an industrial power and battery storage wasteland.\u201d\nThe groups are also concerned that developer Digital Reef is pursuing a local development order (LDO) which, if granted, would mean the development would not require a formal planning application. \nInstead, the development would be approved by a strategic planning committee. \nMr Pirie said: \"Pressed on why the guidance for the LDO process has been ignored, we were again met with stonewalling that has been going on for some months.\"\nThe group has raised concerns that the council is simply \"waving through the plan\". \nMr Morgon said Digital Reef would need to meet the planning authority's \"strict parameters\" before being given the go-ahead. \nHe added: \u201cThis includes economic growth and data security, but [the planning authority] cannot consider the potential income to the council.\u201d\nHe said there was \u201cstill much to do\u201d and that Digital Reef has not yet finalised its proposals. The council has maintained that residents \u201cwill be listened to\u201d.\nA timeline for the process has not been provided, but a public consultation on the proposals could be carried out later this year.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "As the BBC\u2019s highest-paid news presenter, Huw Edwards was on a salary of almost half a million pounds.\nSo recouping the money from the time of his arrest last year, before he resigned in April, might go some way to restoring faith in the corporation\u2019s handling of one of its biggest - and now entirely disgraced - stars.\nBut in writing to Edwards to ask him to return the money, the BBC appears to be relying on him to do the right thing.\nIn light of what we now know about his past behaviour, how realistic is that position?\nThe board says that he \u201chas clearly undermined trust in the BBC and brought us into disrepute\u201d.  It  calls him the \u201cvillain of the piece\u201d.  \nStrong words and an indication of the recognition of just how much it has damaged the BBC\u2019s reputation.\nToday\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t hold back in condemning a man who, until very recently, was one of the BBC\u2019s most trusted presenters.  \nThis would have been unimaginable a year ago. But so much has changed, and his betrayal of the BBC and all it stands for is deeply felt by the corporation.\nBut the board is firmly backing the decisions by the director general and other executives last year, to continue to pay Edwards after his arrest.\nHe would have received around \u00a3200,000 of licence fee payers\u2019 money over the five months after the BBC knew he had been arrested in November, and before he was given the space to resign.\n\nSome will understand the BBC felt it had contractual and duty of care responsibilities. But many won\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s also instructive that the chair, Samir Shah, who took up his post in March, has said he\u2019s \u201cexercised\u201d by the ongoing issue of how the BBC handles bad behaviour by those with power within the organisation.\nThe independent review they\u2019re launching that will make recommendations into workplace culture will be welcome. \nBut there have already been two internal investigations.\nOne was into the original allegations against Huw Edwards made by the Sun newspaper, that he paid a teenager for explicit photographs. \nAfter that there was a confidential disciplinary process into his behaviour towards colleagues. \nNeither was published in any form.\nHow much these investigations will inform this new one - if at all -  isn\u2019t yet clear, and whilst it will be published, it will be forward-looking, rather than than dealing with the specific concerns raised in the past.\nThe true test in future will be how thoroughly the BBC listens to employees who have concerns - and whether it will fully act on their complaints.",

    "A man who falsely confessed to stealing money from his mother's post office to protect her from going to prison has said he shed tears of relief when his conviction was quashed.\nRavinder Naga pleaded guilty to stealing \u00a335,000 after auditors discovered an alleged shortfall at Belville Street Post Office in Greenock - but appeal judges overturned his conviction on Thursday. \nHe is the eighth victim of the Post Office Horizon scandal to be cleared through the court system in Scotland.\nHe told BBC Scotland News he would not feel like he had justice until everyone involved had justice.\nIn 2009 auditors turned up at the post office where his mother was the sub-postmistress, and uncovered an alleged shortfall.\nMr Naga, from Port Glasgow, said he told his mum to tell investigators he had stolen the money to \"buy some time\".\nThey had no idea at the time that the Horizon IT system had bugs and errors that caused phantom shortfalls.\nThe \"missing\" money never appeared and the father-of-two ended up pleading guilty to theft. \nHe was sentenced to 300 hours of community service and the family lost their business.\nMr Naga said he caught Tuberculosis while carrying out his community service and struggled to get work in the years that followed. But he doesn't regret taking the blame.\nHe said the family feared his mum wouldn't have survived a potential prison sentence: \nMr Naga said: \"I feel if I hadn't done what I'd done 15 years ago, I wouldn't be sitting here now getting my conviction overturned. \n\"I'd have been sitting here now getting a letter saying that my dead mum was being exonerated, because that's the effect it would have had on the family.\"\n\nOn Monday he and his mother returned to their former Post Office for the first time in 15 years. It took a locksmith to get in.\nThe roof had collapsed and it looked like it had been ransacked. But there were still pockets of normality - greetings cards neatly stacked on shelves and some post office signs still intact.\nBut for his mum, Gurbash Kaur Naga, the state of their former Post Office represented the toll the Horizon scandal had taken on people: \"Look around the building. I think that's how people's lives are as well.\n\"Where do you start clearing up your life now? It's not going to be done in a day.\"\nRavinder Naga did not know whether he would be included in legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament to automatically clear victims of the Horizon scandal because he was not the sub-postmaster.\nIn the end appeal judges quashed his conviction.\nMr Naga said he was grateful to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission for examining his case but said if it was not for his solicitor Greg Cunningham he might have given up on his fight for justice.\nMr Cunningham said he believed Mr Naga was innocent as soon as they met: \"I knew in the first five minutes of speaking with Ravinder Naga and his mother that their story was true and the conviction was false.\n\"Mr Naga\u2019s case was unique in Scotland in as far as I am aware. His case highlights how the post office scandal did not only affect the sub-postmasters but their families too.\"\n\"Mr Naga is innocent in every sense of the word. Mr Naga vs The Post Office would be an emotional watch and a story worth telling.\"\nRavinder Naga will now be entitled to compensation but said he would still fight for his mother to receive what she was entitled to after losing a business built up over years.\nAnd he remains conscious that some people died before they could be cleared: \u201cI've not had justice yet, because not everybody\u2019s had justice. We haven't brought anybody back to life.\u201d\nA Post Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are truly sorry for the suffering caused by Post Office\u2019s past actions. \n\"We are doing all we can to help victims get answers and to put things right, as far as that can ever be possible.\u201d",

    "A child psychologist has urged parents to be \"honest\" with their children about a deadly knife attack without \"overloading or frightening them\".\nThree young girls died at a Taylor Swift themed dance class in Southport on Monday, with 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana charged with murder in the aftermath. \nProf Rachel Calam said caregivers should reassure children attacks like this are \"incredibly rare\" and \"everybody is working to keep them safe\". \n\"They may needs lots of extra care over the next few weeks,\" she said. \nChildren have be seen laying tributes to the Elsie Dot Stancombe, Alice Dasilva Aguiar and Bebe King, the young victims of Monday's attack. \nOthers have helped their parents in the clean-up operation in Southport after violent unrest in the town on Tuesday which led to five arrests.\nProf Calam said the riots \"work against\" reassurance parents give their children, because they add to an \"underlying sense of fear\", and are something they cannot avoid. \nThe child and family psychologist for the University of Manchester helped to compile a leaflet giving parents tip on how to talk to children after the 2017 Manchester Arena Attack. \nShe told BBC North West Tonight it was important to follow the child's lead, listen to them, and find the moment when they want to ask a question or talk about a traumatic incident. \n\"There's so much going on in Southport, and children will know about it,\" Prof Calam said. \n\"Children will be showing immediate reactions, they may be having trouble sleeping, they may be upset.\n\"Communicate in small chunks so that you know the child is actually picking up on what happened, and understanding.\"\nParents \"shouldn\u2019t be hiding\" information \"because children might pick up all sorts of different ideas about what\u2019s happened\", she said.\nThe psychologist said \"rituals like laying flowers, and helping to rebuild the mosque\" which was targeted by rioters, can help young people.\nBut parents should seek help if children are still showing \"high levels of distress\" when they return to school or weeks after the attack. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A statue commemorating the first entirely British-designed and built motor car is to be installed later this year. \nIn 1897, engineer Richard Stephens built his prototype model A on a small assembly line in Clevedon. \nCar enthusiast Mark Reber, organiser of the Clevedon Cars and Coffee event, came up with the idea for a statue of the first Stephens car which will be on display in the town.\n\"He was a pioneer in car manufacturing, his competitors at the time were building one-offs when he made a whole fleet,\" he said.\nRichard Stephens was born in Cwmbran, Monmouthshire, in 1856. Through his work in America, he became acquainted with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Ransom Olds, founder of the Oldsmobile car company. \nInspired by their companies, he set up his own car manufacturer when he moved to Clevedon, near Bristol.\n\"The early models were quite advanced,\" said engineering historian William Fairney, who has written about Stephens' cars.\n\"They could hit speeds over 40mph, and cruised quite steadily around 30mph. Stephens even invented his own suspension systems.\n\"His cars had two forward gears, which were belt driven, and one reverse gear: you had to get out and push,\" he added.\nIn the early 1900s, Richard Stephens built the first motorised taxi for an operator in Bath, and a nine-seater bus, all adaptations of his first design. \nStephens also used his cars for day excursions from Clevedon for paying customers, a return journey to Cheddar costing \u00a31. \nToday, there are only two surviving cars from the twelve that were manufactured and the company folded in 1916 after competition from other companies. \nMr Reber described Mr Stephens as a local \"renaissance man.\" \n\"When I learned about the company and nobody at my car meet had heard about the company, I knew I had to do something,\" he said.\n\"Nobody built cars as good as he did, and there should be a small museum to him in the town.\n\"It's amazing he took five local Clevedonians and made cars with locally-sourced materials which are still around 127 years later.\"\nThe statue will be installed later this year. \nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Stock markets were hit by a global sell-off on Friday as weak US jobs growth stoked fears of a sudden downturn in the world's largest economy.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq index dropped by more than 2.4%, dragged lower by Intel and Amazon, after the companies reported disappointing results. \nOfficial data showed employers added 114,000 jobs in July, far fewer than expected, while the unemployment rate rose to its highest level in nearly three years. \nThe figures suggested the long-running jobs boom in the US might be coming to an end and drove speculation about when and by how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates.\nStock markets were already worried about high borrowing costs and unsettled by signs that a long-running rally in share prices, fuelled in part by optimism over artificial intelligence (AI), might be running out steam.\nFriday's decline in the Nasdaq brought the index down about 10% from its most recent peak - a fall known as a \u201ccorrection\u201d - that in this case has happened in a matter of weeks.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average also dropped 1.5% on Friday, and the S&P 500 ended 1.8% lower, after markets in Asia and Europe sank.\nIn Japan, the Nikkei 225 index tumbled nearly 6%.\nEarlier this week, the Federal Reserve held interest rates again, but signalled it was likely to cut rates at its next meeting in September.\n\"Now the question isn't will they [Federal Reserve] cut in September, but by how much,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets.\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the latest jobs figures raised questions about whether the Fed had waited too long.\n\"Job gains have dropped below the 150,000 threshold that would be considered consistent with a solid economy,\" she said. \n\"A September rate cut is in the bag and the Fed will be hoping that they haven\u2019t, once again, been too slow to act.\"\nFriday's report from the Labor Department showed the unemployment rate rising to 4.3% - the highest rate since 2021 and up from 3.5% a year ago.\nWage gains have also slowed, with average hourly pay rising just 3.6% over the last 12 months.\nOn Friday, shares in Amazon dropped by more than 10%, despite the e-commerce giant reporting sales growth of 10% in the most recent quarter.  \nThe firm would be hit hard by any downturn in the US economy and also ran into investor scepticism about heavy AI spending. \nIntel shares also plunged more than 27%, after the chipmaker warned it would need to take drastic action to restore growth, including cutting more than 15,000 jobs.\nBenchmark crude oil prices, which can reflect expectations about economic growth, also fell nearly 3%.\nThe stock market turmoil has emerged in the middle of a heated US presidential campaign, which has raised the stakes for the Fed and opened its moves up to intense political debate.\nRepublicans have suggested that lowering rates would amount to helping Democrats, with the party's presidential candidate Donald Trump saying a pre-election rate cut is \"something that they know they shouldn\u2019t be doing\".\nBut Fed officials have consistently argued that politics do not bear on their decisions over rates.\nIn a statement following the jobs figures, President Joe Biden said the economy was still making progress.\nThe US economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.8% this spring, bouncing back after a slump at the start of the year.\nLast month's uptick in the unemployment rate also appeared driven by a rise in people looking for work, rather than a sudden surge in job losses, analysts said.  \nNancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said she thought the report was \"overstating emerging weakness\".\n\"We aren't dismissing the entire upward creep in the unemployment rate, but the economy is not in recession,\" she said.

    "Beijing is cracking down on \"aggressive fans\" who it says are affecting the performance of Chinese athletes at the Paris Olympics - the latest in its years-long war against celebrity worship.\nIn recent days, state media reports have called out \"inappropriate\" behaviour, such as fans booing during events or accusing referees of being unfair.\nThis \"fan culture\", they said, reached a peak on 3 August when paddler Chen Meng defeated teammate Sun Yingsha to win gold in the table tennis women's singles.\nThe Chinese internet exploded with support for Ms Sun despite her loss, with some denouncing Ms Chen's victory,  saying she won only because Ms Sun was exhausted from three earlier events.\nChinese social media platforms have collectively removed tens of thousands of posts and banned over 800 accounts for allegedly \"spreading negativity and fomenting conflict\" about the event.\nOne of Ms Sun's fans wrote that she \"wishes Chen tests positive for a banned substance, then the gold medal can go to [Sun],\" sparking anger online. \nA 29-year-old woman has also been arrested for posting defamatory comments about the match.\nIt's not clear what she had said but police said on Tuesday that she \u201cmaliciously fabricated information and blatantly defamed others, resulting in an adverse impact on society\u201d.\nThis is the latest in Beijing's crackdown on what it calls \"toxic\" celebrity culture.\nPreviously,  China has seen the banning of celebrity rankings, the restructuring of fan clubs, and  the regular scrubbing of \"harmful\" content from fan pages.\nIn the last few days, the state-run Global Times newspaper published several articles denouncing \"fan culture\" in sports. \nOne of its reports said \"numerous Chinese people\" were now worried about \"the visibly aggressive fan culture that threatens to erode the sporting world\".\nIn addition to inflammatory comments directed at sporting personalities, authorities have also criticised fans who cheer loudly or use flash photography during matches, and those who profit by selling memorabilia signed by athletes.\n\"The [fan culture] not only affects the training and competition of Chinese athletes, but also seriously affects the reputation of Chinese sports,\" state news agency Xinhua said in a video report on Wednesday.\nShanghai Daily published a commentary urging social media platforms to \"enforce strict policies against malicious behaviours\" and sporting organisations to \"take a firm stance against... fan mania\".\nChinese authorities had warned against \"fan culture\" even before the Paris Olympics.\nLate last year, the Chinese Olympic Committee and General Administration of Sport of China told fans off after repeated incidents of them filming and following athletes.\n\u201cIt seems that these \u2018low-level fans\u2019 are driven by their love for idols and impulsively make irrational actions that endanger the normal order of events, public order and good customs, sportsmanship and social morality,\u201d they had said in a joint statement.\nAhead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, the committee warned Chinese Olympians not to get involved in fan clubs, adding that it wants to \"resolutely put an end to the spread of the chaos of fan culture to the field of sports\". \nThe athletes themselves have said they want to be treated with \"respect\". Veteran table tennis player Deng Yaping, for instance, had urged fans to \"express our preferences without attacking others\".\nShe added: \"We must respect each other and leave space for everyone.\" \nAdditional reporting by Ian Tang",

    "The UK's inflation rate has risen for the first time this year, official figures show. \nOverall prices rose by 2.2% in the year to July, slightly above the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2% where the rate had been since May.\nA rise was widely predicted and is due to prices of gas and electricity falling by less than they did a year before. The increase is also less than many economists had expected. \nThe latest figures mean that prices are now rising faster across the UK than in previous months, but still at a slower pace than in 2022 and 2023 when households were hit especially hard by higher energy and food bills.\nThe Bank of England expects inflation - which measures the rate at which prices rise - to go up to 2.75% in the coming months before falling below 2% next year.\nAnother set of inflation figures, as well as employment and wages data, will be released before its next rate-setting meeting on 19 September.\nThe Bank had put up interest rates to tackle soaring inflation but last month cut them to 5% from 5.25% - the first reduction since the start of the pandemic.\nHigher rates can be good for savers but may drive up the cost of mortgages and other loans for consumers.\nExperts have been predicting further cuts this year, with investors now raising their bets that the Bank will opt for a cut in September. \nSanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank Research, said: \"A September rate cut should no longer be off the table. And it\u2019s entirely conceivable to think that we could get multiple more rate cuts this year.\"\nBut Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at research group Capital Economics, said Wednesday\u2019s data \u201cmay not alleviate the Bank\u2019s concerns about persistent price pressures entirely\u201d. \nThe Bank also looks at inflation in the services sector, for example, when deciding on rates.\nWhile prices in this sector slowed to 5.2% in July, this was partly attributed to airfares and hotel stays which can be quite volatile.\nGregory added, however, that she expects the Bank to cut again this year, bringing its main interest rate down to 4.5% from 5%.\nInterest rate cuts could be good news for businesses, which have been dealing with higher rates and surging inflation over the last few years.\nLivia Marrocco, owner of Marrocco\u2019s restaurant and ice cream shop in Hove, told the BBC: \u201cProducts have gone up. Ingredients have gone up. We have put prices up slightly.\u201d\nHowever, she said that things have been looking up recently as the good weather  and school holidays were bringing in more customers.\nInflation surged to 11.1% in the wake of the Ukraine war and pandemic-related supply chain crunches, driving up the cost of living for millions. \nBut it had been steadily falling until June, as the Bank of England increased interest rates to dampen consumer demand.\nGrant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: \"Inflation ticked up a little in July as although domestic energy costs fell, they fell by less than a year ago.\n\"This was partially offset by hotel costs, which fell in July after strong growth in June.\"\nMr Fitzner also told the BBC's Today programme on Wednesday that \"under the bonnet\" price rises remained under control, with services inflation down in July and food prices unchanged. \n\"This still suggests that inflation pressures at least in the short run are fairly moderate,\" he said.\nAccording to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, food and drink prices surged by 28.4% between September 2021 and September 2023.\nIts latest analysis suggested that less well-off households saw their food bill rise by far more than those with higher incomes, as the sharpest price increases had been applied to cheaper brands.\nBut in July, food price inflation had settled down to just 1.5%, according to the ONS.\nDarren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, said that the new Labour government is \"under no illusion\" about the challenges still facing households.\nBut shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt said that the new figures show that there is \"more to be done to keep inflation down\". \nThe prospect that further falls in interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowing could create a pick-up in activity in the housing market.\nSeparate figures published by the ONS on Wednesday show that house prices have been rising, although the data pre-dates August\u2019s cut in interest rates.\nUK property prices rose by 2.7% in the year to the end of June, the ONS said.\nIn England, an increase of 2.4% pushed the average house price above \u00a3300,000.\nThe increase of \u00a37,000 in the year meant the cost of an average home in England stood at \u00a3305,000, compared with \u00a3216,000 in Wales, \u00a3192,000 in Scotland, and \u00a3185,000 in Northern Ireland.\nLook at your cupboards so you know what you have already\nHead to the reduced section first to see if it has anything you need\nBuy things close to their best before date which will be cheaper and use your freezer\nRead more tips here",

    "A group of litter pickers are calling for a tourist tax to be introduced because the beaches are \"riddled with nappies, vapes and plastic\" during peak seasons.\nSophie Newton runs Sophie's Super Litter Picking, a volunteer community group who host monthly beach cleans and litter picking events in Weston-super-Mare.\nThey are calling upon North Somerset Council to introduce a \u2018holiday tax\u2019, where tourists get charged small fees to mitigate the negative effects of tourism and invest back into the community.\nCouncil leader Mike Bell said there are more than 40 bins on the seafront which are emptied daily, and that action is taken against those caught littering.\nCurrently, councils in England cannot directly impose a tourist tax but several - including Liverpool and Manchester - have done so via a \"legal workaround\".\nOn 29 July, Ms Newton litter picked for more than two and a half hours along Weston-super-Mare's beach, walking for three miles (4.8km) and collecting 18 bags full of rubbish. \nThe local volunteer, who first started litter picking after moving to the area in 2012, said discarded waste on the beach has never been so bad.\nThe group have come across many discarded items buried in the sand or crammed between benches, including nappies, baby wipes, empty cans, kites, toys, underwear, and even a female catheter. \n\"More people means more rubbish,\" said Ms Newton.\n\"No one type of person or demographic is to blame. As a seaside town, we simply aren't ever prepared for the influx of visitors and unfortunately, we very much cannot afford the extra provisions required from our council tax alone.\"\nTourist taxes have long been the norm for many countries in Europe, such as Greece, Spain and Germany. It is often added onto the cost of accommodation, and usually ranges from between \u00a31 to \u00a35 per day, per person. \nIt is largely intended to temper over-tourism and raise funds for construction and investment in community development projects locally. \n\"Whilst I appreciate it will be controversial and not supported by all, it's a huge success in many European countries and the money is being used to support the local economy and tourist areas,\" Ms Newton added. \nMr Bell, who represents Weston-super-Mare Central ward covering the seafront and main beach, said the authority \"work really hard\" to keep the areas \"looking their best\".\n\u201cSadly, there are people who don\u2019t dispose of their rubbish responsibly and we do take action against those who litter,\" he said.\n\"So far this year we have issued 72 fixed penalty notices for littering in Weston, and we are increasing our patrols in the seafront area for the rest of the summer.\n\u201cWe hope people enjoy their time in Weston and we ask everyone to act responsibly and leave only footprints.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "A group of United Nations experts has said that Venezuela's presidential election lacked \"basic transparency and integrity\".\nThe UN panel of experts has echoed the criticism levelled by the Carter Center, whose independent observers said earlier that the election \"could not be considered democratic\".\nBoth organisations have criticised Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) for declaring the incumbent, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the winner without publishing detailed voting tallies. \nThe UN human rights chief had earlier warned of a \"climate of fear\" caused by arbitrary detentions carried out in the wake of the election. \nAccording to the Venezuelan government, more than 2,400 people have been detained since 29 July - the day the disputed election result was announced.  \nUN Human Rights Chief Volker T\u00fcrk said in a statement published on Tuesday that \"it is especially troubling that so many people are being detained, accused or charged with incitement to hatred under counterterrorism legislation\".\nThe UN denounced the fact that in the weeks since the vote, street protests and criticism on social media had been met with \"fierce repression\" by the state.\nIt said its independent rights experts had recorded 23 deaths between 28 July - when the election was held - and 8 August. Most of them were caused by gunfire.\nMr Maduro on Monday put the death toll at 25 and blamed \"opposition violence\" for the deaths.\nHe urged the justice system - which is largely under the control of his socialist PSUV party - to act with an \"iron fist\".\nUN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk insisted that all deaths be investigated and stressed there should be no repeat of the \"disproportionate use of force by law enforcement officials and the attacks on demonstrators by armed individuals supporting the government\".\nProtests erupted after the CNE, which is dominated by government allies, declared Mr Maduro the winner without publishing detailed voting tallies.\nThe opposition says the tallies prove that its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, won by a wide margin. It has uploaded copies collected by its observers on election night to the internet.\nThese tallies - which have been reviewed by independent observers and media - suggest Mr Gonz\u00e1lez won 67% of the vote, compared to Mr Maduro's 30%.\nOn Tuesday, a panel of UN experts invited by Venezuela's National Electoral Council   to follow the election made its preliminary results public. \nThe experts found that the election day had taken place \"in a largely peaceful environment\" and  was \"logistically well organised\". \nBut they concluded that the way the CNE had announced the results \"fell short of the basic transparency and integrity measures that are essential to holding credible elections\".\nIn particular, the UN experts highlighted the CNE's failure to publish \"any results (or results broken down by polling stations), to support their oral announcement\" declaring Mr Maduro the winner.\nThey said that this failure \"had no precedent in contemporary democratic elections\".\nThe UN panel also said it had reviewed a small sample of the voting tallies published by the opposition and found them to \"exhibit all the security features  of the original result protocols\".\nThe government had earlier tried to cast doubt on the veracity of the voting tallies uploaded by the opposition, alleging that they lacked the necessary signatures and security features such as QR codes. \nThe Venezuelan foreign ministry has dismissed the UN experts' report has \"a propaganda act serving the interests of the Venezuela far right\".\nJorge Rodr\u00edguez, the head of government-dominated National Assembly, called the UN panel \"fake experts\" and \"rubbish\", and accused them of lying.\nHis proposal to change the electoral laws so that \"no foreigner will ever be able to come to Venezuela to give an opinion on anything related to elections in Venezuela\" was met with a standing ovation. \n\n",
    "A new mural unveiled by street artist Banksy in Charlton, south-east London, has been partially defaced.\nThe piece, which shows a rhino mounting a Nissan Micra with a traffic cone on its bonnet, was spray painted with a tag by a man wearing a black balaclava at around 19:45 BST.\nStephanie Lester, a witness who spoke to BBC News, said the man had \"walked away from a jeering crowd\".\nIt had earlier appeared on Westmoor Street and was confirmed on Banksy's Instagram account.\nThe now-defaced rhino was the eighth new London piece by Banksy in eight days.\nAnother witness, Devan Vadukul, told the BBC a \"random youth\" in a balaclava had \"brazenly walked up and defaced the installation with a graffiti tag\".\nHe added: \"The whole incident took place within less than 30 seconds before he disappeared with another male accomplice further down the road.\"\nThe incident comes a day after Banksy painted swimming piranhas on to a City of London Police sentry box, which was first spotted on Sunday morning.\nThe translucent fish formed the seventh piece in an animal-themed art series across the capital.\nOn Monday, the City of London Corporation said the artwork had been removed to a \"safe location\".\nA spokesperson said: \"We have moved the artwork to Guildhall Yard to ensure it is properly protected and open for the public to view safely.\n\"A permanent home for the piece will be decided in due course.\"\nOn 5 August, a goat appeared on the side of a building near Kew Bridge, followed by an image of two elephants touching trunks on the side of a house in Chelsea on Tuesday.\nThree monkeys hanging from a bridge in Brick Lane then drew crowds on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, a howling wolf on a satellite dish - which looked like the animal was howling at the Moon - was installed on to a garage roof in Peckham.\nBut just a few hours later it was seen taken down by men and carried off down Rye lane.  \nThe artist is neither connected to nor endorses the theft of the wolf design and they have \"no knowledge as to the dish's current whereabouts\", Banksy's press team confirmed.\nOn Friday, locals in Walthamstow woke up to find two pelicans fishing above a fish shop.\nAnd on Saturday, a stencil of a cat having a stretch appeared on an empty billboard in Cricklewood.\nCrowds booed as the piece in Cricklewood was dismantled by three men who said they had been \"hired\" by a \"contracting company\" to take down the billboard for safety reasons.\nIn the historic Old Bailey courts on Monday, Judge Mark Lucraft KC discharged a jury after it failed to reach a verdict in a death by careless driving trial and suggested they might enjoy the weather with a visit to the nearby Banksy instead.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Last week, Damion Bailey posted on Instagram that he had just achieved his \u201cpersonal best\u201d \u2013 a 13-and-a-half hour flight between Shanghai and Dallas without any in-flight entertainment, films, books or music.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite tough, honestly,\u201d the 34-year-old from Miami, Florida tells BBC News. But he keeps doing it.\nMr Bailey is part of a new travel trend, known as \u201craw-dogging\u201d, where passengers spend long hours mid-air just staring straight ahead. \nThe longer you do it, the tougher you have apparently proven yourself to be. \n\u201cJust raw-dogged it, 15 hour flight to Melbourne,\" boasts Australian music producer Torren Foot on TikTok, blinking hard as if to stay awake.\n\"No music, no movies, just flight map.\"\nSome also avoid eating or drinking. A few say they won\u2019t get up at all, even to use the toilet. But health experts warn that more extreme versions of the trend can pose serious risks. \nManchester City footballer Erling Haaland recently joined the trend, posting that he had got through a seven-hour flight with \u201cno phone, no sleep, no water, no food\u201d and had found it \"easy\".\nResponses on social media questioned if he had really stuck to his own rules (a common question on similar posts from others). Some wondered if he was a robot. \nAnd some simply asked \"why\"?\nPosts about \u201craw-dogging\u201d have grown steadily over the last year. \nIncreasing numbers of young men \u2013 and it is mostly athletic-looking young men \u2013 are posting videos of themselves on board, staring at the in-flight map or the safety instructions card, vowing to use the \u201cpower of the mind\u201d to get them through.\nAs for the term \u201craw-dogging\u201d, it might have carnal origins, but increasingly it is used for anything being done without protection or support.\nFor these men, the appeal seems to be the opportunity to prove their resilience and self-control.\nSome medical experts warn of the significant health risks of taking long flights without food, water or moving around.\n\u201cThey\u2019re idiots,\u201d says Dr Gill Jenkins, a GP who also works as a medical escort in air ambulance work. \u201cA digital detox might do you some good, but all the rest of it is against medical advice,\" she says.\n\"The whole thing about the risk of long-haul flying is that you\u2019re at risk of dehydration.\n\"If you\u2019re not moving you\u2019re at risk of deep vein thrombosis, which is compounded by dehydration. Not going to the toilet, that\u2019s a bit stupid. If you need the loo, you need the loo.\"\nBut on the trend as a whole, business psychologist Danielle Haig says she can see why people would want to spend time in quiet reflection, allowing their mind to wander, in our increasingly fast-paced, technology-driven world.\n\u201cIt offers an opportunity to recharge mentally, gain new perspectives,\u201d she says.\nShe thinks the trend signifies \u201ca collective yearning for balance as people seek to reclaim their mental space and foster a deeper connection with their inner selves\u201d.\nAnd she reckons that raw-dogging allows young men, in particular, the chance to showcase their ability to handle solitude and discomfort with stoicism.\n\nMr Bailey says he enjoys the \"challenge\".\n\u201cThe first time I did it was on a shorter flight, out of necessity,\" he says.\n\"I forgot my headphones, and there wasn\u2019t anything on the entertainment that I wanted to watch.\u201d\nBut he has carried on doing it. \u201cI like the challenge, for sure. I fly so often. Why not challenge myself?\u201d\nAllowing yourself to be bored for a few hours is actually quite good for us, argues Sandi Mann, academic and author of The Science of Boredom. \u201cIt can really improve our relaxation and creativity.\u201d\nPeople have to find ways to wean themselves off the constant \u201chighs\u201d they get from modern technology, she says.\n\u201cWe need to reduce our need for novelty and stimulation and whizzy-whizzy bang-bang dopamine, and just take time out to breathe and stare at the clouds - literally, if you're on a flight,\u201d she says.\nBut she acknowledges all the current advice stresses the importance of staying mobile, particularly on longer flights, and also suggests avoiding food and water would pose added health risks.\n\u201cI think people need to understand this is not ideal for a seven-hour flight,\" says Ms Mann. \"You've got to get the balance right.\u201d\nClearly, it is not for everyone.\n\u201cSounds like self-inflicted torture with literally no incentive,\" says one social media user. \"Give me my in-flight wi-fi, my sleep mask and let\u2019s throw in some snacks.\u201d \nOthers doubt whether all of the people posting about their 10-hour flights really have stuck to their self-imposed rules.\nAnd some who have tried raw-dogging themselves haven\u2019t come away impressed.\n\"Big mistake,\" says a user on TikTok called Brenda. \"Pretty sure the only thing that took off was my sanity.\n\u201cNote to self, won\u2019t be doing that again. Definitely an overrated experience. Not at all enlightening as people make out.\u201d",
    "Swimmers could be warned against bathing in a river which has consistently scored poorly for its water quality.\nThe River Cam in Sheep's Green, Cambridgeshire, was one of 27 sites to be awarded bathing status designation in May, but it has repeatedly failed to meet the minimum standard for water quality.\nIf its water does not meet the minimum standard, work to improve it will begin.\nCam Valley Forum said a poor rating would not be surprising, and it hoped it would trigger action to discover the source of the problem.\nThe forum's Anne Miller said wetter weather could have a negative impact on quality as it could cause sewage to enter the water.\n\"It's absolutely no surprise. We applied [for bathing status] because we knew it was very likely to get an official poor rating... but that will speed up improvements and we want to know who the culprits are and get it fixed,\" she said.\n\"I'm pleased to see from the latest Environment Agency water quality test results, that, now that it's stopped raining so much, the water quality is at last improving. \n\"It\u2019s still not good, but not as poor as it was.\u201d\nInland bathing waters are tested by the Environment Agency on their concentration of E.coli and intestinal enterococci between May and September.

    "Plans have been unveiled to repair the crumbling walls and paths around a lake in a West Yorkshire park.\nThe public is currently unable to access part of the lake perimeter in Pontefract Park, as it has become a hazard.\nWakefield Council agreed to invest \u00a31.3m to repair the damage in 2021, but the work was delayed due to legislation changes which reclassified the lake as a reservoir due to its size.\nA planning application has now been submitted to carry out the repairs, which also include building a spillway and putting up safety fencing.\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, a report said: \"The walls and paths around the lake have fallen into disrepair with many of the walls now rotating into the lake, creating safety issues and making the lake less attractive to users.\n\"A public safety risk assessment has also identified the need for additional safety measures around the lake, including strategic use of fences and measures to facilitate escape from the water.\"\nIt is hoped all footpaths surrounding the lake with be reopened once the work is completed.\nThe work is part of a masterplan for Pontefract which aims to establish the town as a \u201ccultural destination\u201d by 2028.\nThe report added: \"Pontefract Park is highlighted as playing a vital role in offering the local public health and wellbeing lifestyle benefits.\n\"It also contributes to helping the wider promotion of the town\u2019s local and historical culture.\n\"The improvement works are intended to rejuvenate the function and durability of the locally loved public asset.\"\nPontefract Park is the largest urban park in the Wakefield district.\nIt is owned and managed by Wakefield Council and Pontefract Park Race Company, and the racecourse surrounds the lake.\nThe council\u2019s licensing committee act as park trustees.\nTim Johnson, the council\u2019s green space and countryside manager, previously said the work was expected to be carried out during the 2024/25 winter period.\nMr Johnson told\u00a0a licensing committee meeting last November: \"We were looking to do the work outside the racing season because, obviously, it would put a risk to racing at the site.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Fans at the Olympics are trying out a new AI-powered talent spotting system that hopes to find the gold medallists of the future. Its developers aim to use a portable version of the technology to bring advanced sport science to remote areas around the world.\nAs the alarm sounds, Tacto races frantically to swipe the infra-red sensors in front of him as some of them suddenly flash blue.\nNot far away his younger brother, Tomo, sprints down a short running track as his motion is tracked by a series of cameras.\nThe seven and four-year-old siblings from Yokohama, Japan, are taking part in a series of AI-powered tests that have been specially set up near the Olympic Stadium in Paris.\nThe aim of the system is to identify the potential gold medallists of the future.\nData is gathered from five tests which include activities like running, jumping, and measuring grip strength. \nThis information is then analysed to assess a person's power, explosiveness, endurance, reaction time, strength and agility.\nThe results are compared with data from professional and Olympic athletes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re using computer vision and historical data, so the average person can compare themselves to elite athletes and see what sport they are most physically aligned to,\u201d says Sarah Vickers, head of Intel\u2019s Olympic and Paralympic Program.\nAfter completing the tests, each participant is told which sport they would be most suited to from a list of 10. \nIntel says all the data collected from the people taking part is deleted once the process is complete.\nAside from technology, it is something the young brothers are having fun doing. \n\u201cI enjoyed it,\u201d says Tacto. \u201cI liked the bit where we had to sprint the best.\u201d\nThe AI system that is open to fans at Paris 2024 has a far smaller, more portable counterpart that can be run on most devices which have a basic camera and a little computing power.\n\u201cWith just a mobile phone or a tablet or a PC you have this opportunity to go into places where you couldn\u2019t go before,\u201d says Sarah.\nThis AI technology can assess people\u2019s performance just by analysing video from the camera without the need for physical sensors.\nThe International Olympic Committee recently took the system to Senegal, where it toured around five different villages and assessed more than 1,000 children on their athletic potential.\nPartnering with Senegal\u2019s National Olympic Committee, and after a follow-up round of more advanced tests, it identified 48 children with \u201chuge potential\u201d, and one with \u201cexceptional potential\u201d.\nThey have been offered places on sports programmes if they want, to see how far they can take their athletic abilities.\nIt is hoped that the system can be rolled out further and used to offer opportunities to people in areas which it would be impossible to reach with bulkier assessment systems.\nProf John Brewer, a visiting lecturer at University of Suffolk, who has worked with England\u2019s Football Association on talent identification, says spotting potential at a young age is the \u201choly grail\u201d of sport.\nHowever, he warns that a basic system that can only measure a few attributes would be limited when it comes to technical sports like football or basketball, or ones that require endurance.\n\u201cIf you want to win the marathon or the 10K you have to have that aerobic capacity, that oxygen transport capacity, that no filming will ever show,\u201d he says.\nProf Brewer does see the benefits of the system for making initial assessments of potential athletes.\n\u201cIf they are revealing skill and agility which suggests that they are able to have talent in a particular sport then that has to be encouraged,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if it is portable and can be taken to areas where they don\u2019t necessarily have access to high-tech assessment methods, then that can only be a good thing.\u201d\n\u201cBut it would only be one part of a much bigger talent identification system.\u201d\nBack at the Olympic Stadium, young Tacto has his results - he has been identified as a potential sprinter.\nHe is delighted, although he says he currently prefers football and tennis.\nTwo more experienced athletes are Hank and Brock, who both used to compete for their university in the US at inter-collegiate level. This standard can offer world-class facilities and has produced many Olympians.\n\u201cWe\u2019re former athletes and we\u2019re competitive and thought it\u2019d be fun,\u201d says Hank.\n\u201cThis kind of technology wasn\u2019t around when we were swimming 10 to 15 years ago,\u201d Brock adds.\nAnd what were their results?\n\u201cRugby,\u201d says Hank. \n\u201cI got basketball and I\u2019ve literally never played basketball in my life,\u201d replies Brock.\n\u201cWell, he played with me once and we never allowed him back,\u201d replies Hank.\nIt seems even with AI technology, computers cannot get it right every time.",
    "A six-year-old boy, who was in the car with his dad and younger brother when it rolled down a steep woodland embankment, has been praised for his quick-thinking to flag down a police vehicle.\nMacsen, from Blaenavon, Torfaen, recognised the distinctive yellow of the car and waved to get the officers' attention after the brakes failed on his dad's car.\nHis mum said she was \"in awe\" of her son\u2019s actions and attitude.\n\"One of the worst nightmares for us turned out to be one of the best days of my son's life,\" she said.\nOn 2 August, Meirion Evans, 53, was travelling with Macsen and four-year-old Trystan on the B4246 towards Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, at about 12:45 BST.\nAs he came round a tight bend, his brakes failed and he made a split-second decision to steer between a tree and a gate. The red Fiat 500L flipped as it turned and rolled twice before coming to a stop.\nMr Evans got the boys safely out the car before heading back to the main road to call for help - but Macsen was one step ahead.\nThe youngster had walked on in front of his dad and flagged down a car with two community support officers, Joshua Carey and Leah Murphy, inside.\n\"My husband was like 'how did you get here so fast, I haven't even called yet',\" said Natasha Evans, 36.\nShe said the two boys only had \"superficial bruising\", but her husband \"was a bit more knocked about by the airbag\", although none of them needed hospital treatment.\nShe added her son's chatty nature with the officers came as a shock because \"he's not the most outgoing boy\".\n\"For him to not only be rolled in the car, but to then have that initiative, I'm still in awe,\" she said.\n\"He is obsessed with police officers and the emergency services, he is besotted with them,\" she said.\nShe said all the teams that arrived on scene were \"so brilliant\" with Macsen, chatting to him and showing him their equipment - including letting him keep the breathalyser strip used, as per protocol, on his dad.\n\"He said '0.0 dad, you're not going to jail today',\" said Mrs Evans.\nGwent Police praised Macsen's \"fantastic work\u201d\" adding: \"Thanks to the youngster's quick thinking and bravery, everyone involved was okay and left the scene with only minor injuries.\"\nMacsen \"does get a bit upset\" when he remembers the smashed-up car, which Mrs Evans said would be written off.\nBut she added the experience of meeting the officers, when his dream is to be a police inspector, had made up for it.\n\"He's not stopped talking about it,\" she said, while Macsen added he was \"happy\" to have helped his heroes.",
    "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has dismissed calls to recall Parliament to discuss the violent protests taking place across the country. \nFormer home secretary Dame Priti Patel, Labour MP Diane Abbott and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage are among the politicians urging Sir Keir to cut short the parliamentary recess.\nDame Priti, who is running to be Conservative leader, said there were \"many practical things\" MPs could do if Parliament was recalled.\nBut Sir Keir said his focus was on stopping the disorder and making sure the streets were safe. \nThe prime minister was speaking following an emergency Cobra meetings with ministers and law enforcement representatives.\nHe said an \"army\" of specialist police officers were on standby and the criminal justice system would be ramped up to charge those involved in the disorder.\nHe also emphasised that \"criminal law applies online as well as offline\". Earlier Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said social media firms were being too slow at removing \"criminal material\" from their platforms. \nThe House of Commons stopped sitting last week, but the government can ask the Speaker to recall MPs if there is an event thought to be of national importance\nOver the past decade, the House of Commons and Lords have been recalled from recess six times for events including western forces chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the death of Prince Philip.\nFollowing the 2011 riots in London and other English cities, Parliament was recalled for one day. \nSpeaking to Times Radio, Dame Priti said politicians needed to \"get some kind of grip on this, which is why I am calling for the recall of Parliament right now so that we can actually discuss these issues.\"\n\"Local authorities are now under pressure, the police are under pressure to do more effectively, we need to find out what more do they need.\"\nHowever, other Tory leadership hopefuls Kemi Badenoch and James Cleverly have said they do not back a recall. \nMr Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a recall was not necessary to ensure MPs were receiving a \"clear flow\" of information. \n\"There's nothing that needs to be voted on, there are no additional powers (needed).\"\nBacking a recall, veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott said: \"This is an extraordinarily grave situation. You've got people trying to burn down hostels where asylum seekers are cowering. You've got people attacking black and Muslim people on the street.\n\"We need to be able to question ministers on what exactly is being done and we want to speak up for our communities.\"\nAnother Labour MP, Dawn Butler, said: \"It may be time to recall Parliament. This violence needs to stop.\"\nReform UK leader and MP Nigel Farage said there needed to be \"a more honest debate\" about immigration and policing was needed and that a recall of Parliament would be \"an appropriate start to this\". \nLast week, Mr Farage rejected accusations he had \"whipped up\" rioters by asking whether \"the truth is being withheld from us\", after police said the Southport attack was not being treated as a terror incident.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey welcomed the measures taken by the government adding: \"People from all backgrounds and all walks of life have come together to condemn these riots and clean up the damage - it is they who truly represent Britain, not the rioters and those who have incited them.\"\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP, has written to the home secretary calling for an urgent meeting to \"discuss what actions are planned to stamp out this racist terror\".\nIn a joint letter with four other independent MPs Ayoub Khan (MP for Birmingham Perry Barr), Adnan Hussain (Blackburn), Iqbal Mohamed (Dewsbury and Batley) and Shockat Adam (Leicester South), Mr Corbyn urged the government not to \"give succour to those seeking to sow hatred and division\". \nThe Green Party said the disorder had been caused by \"racism and Islamophobia\" and urged the government to \"celebrate and defend our Muslim citizens and their place in our diverse society\".

    "Broadcaster Kirsty Young has revealed the loneliness of living with chronic pain, describing it as \"very isolating\".\nThe former Desert Island Discs presenter stepped back from the programme in 2018 after she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, Young said she was \"hollowed out by it\".\nShe also said she felt a sense of \"failure and shame\", as well as a reluctance to talk about it to other people.\n\"It's very isolating,\" she told presenter Emma Barnett. \"It came as a surprise to even people I worked very closely with. People who are friends.\n\"They were like, 'Oh, I didn't know'. And I thought, well yeah, you didn't know because I didn't talk about it. It was a little private horror.\"\nFibromyalgia causes pain all over the body and can bring on severe fatigue. Young also has rheumatoid arthritis, which causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints. The two long-term conditions are often linked.\nThe broadcaster said she felt a certain self-consciousness about discussing her condition. \"There are a lot of feelings that surround it, I think a sense of failure and shame,\" she explained.\n\"[There's] a sense that there are people much worse off than me. Which of course is true, there are people dealing with stage three diagnosis of cancer, so why am I going to talk about chronic pain? \n\"There's that sense in which there's always somebody worse off. Well that's true, but if you're in your life, and you are dealing with chronic pain day in, day out, night in, night out, then that's a hell of a thing to deal with.\"\nShe added: \"But I'm self-conscious talking to you about it today. I'm self-conscious about it, and I also think it's ridiculous to be self-conscious.\"\nYoung described how one doctor \"snorted\" when she suggested she might have fibromyalgia, before she was finally diagnosed.\nShe said she recognised the many demands on the NHS, but added: \"I would say that it would be to the advantage of the overstretched health service to take people with chronic long-term pain seriously and not just palm them off with either a big pack of painkillers or some heavy antidepressants.\"\nYoung returned to the airwaves a few years after stepping down from Desert Island Discs, fronting occasional major events for the BBC.\nShe presented BBC coverage of Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee and then the monarch's funeral in 2022.\nShe returned to Desert Island Discs, this time as an interviewee, later that year, where she also spoke about living with fibromyalgia in a conversation with her successor as presenter, Lauren Laverne.\nIf you have been affected by any of these issues, speak with a doctor.

    "Safeguarding services involved with a girl before she murdered a teenager did not know about her \"fascination with violent acts\" and had \"no reason to be concerned\" about their contact, a review has found.\nScarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe were jailed for life for the \"brutal, planned and sadistic\" murder of 16-year-old Brianna Ghey in a Warrington park in February 2023.\nJenkinson, who was 15 at the time, had moved to Brianna's school in November 2022 after spiking a younger pupil at her former school. \nAn independent safeguarding review found there had been \"no reason known\" to stop Jenkinson \"mixing freely\" with pupils after her move and nothing to suggest she was a \"serious risk\".\nEsther Ghey, Brianna\u2019s mother, said the review \"clearly found that nobody could have predicted the events that took place\".\n\u201cWe are now focused on looking forward to creating a safer, more empathetic and resilient society in Brianna\u2019s legacy,\" she said. \nJenkinson and Ratcliffe were found guilty of the transgender teenager's murder in December 2023 and a judge subsequently lifted reporting restrictions on them being named when they were sentenced two months later.\nA review of contact with Jenkinson was subsequently ordered, covering her interactions with support agencies in Warrington.\nIt did not cover Ratcliffe, due to him living in neighbouring Wigan.\nIt said Jenkinson had moved from Culcheth High School to Birchwood Community High School in November 2022 after she gave a 13-year-old a cannabis sweet, which caused them to fall ill.\nIt found that Jenkinson had been seen by GPs and child mental health services in the years before murder, but safeguarding agencies were not aware of her two previous attempts to murder Brianna in January 2023.\nIt also found that they did not know she had used the dark web to watch videos of torture and killing, a fact that was revealed at her trial.\nThe review said Jenkinson met with GPs and child mental health services to discuss anxiety and self-harming in November 2021 and had several subsequent meetings.\nIt said in the weeks before Brianna was killed, Jenkinson described hearing voices that were \"saying unkind things and putting her down\".\nHowever, it said clinical evidence for Jenkinson's diagnosis of \"conduct dissocial disorder\", which was revealed at her sentencing, was not present before the murder as mental health services were \"still in the process of assessing... and formulating a clinical opinion\" at the time of the attack.\nThe review also said Jenkinson's spiking of the younger pupil in September 2023 was \"at best unkind, or worse a deliberate attempt to give someone what could be a frightening experience\", but was not behaviour \"at a level which could reasonably be expected to make practitioners suspect that [she] would go on to commit murder\". \nHowever, the review found a safeguarding file detailing non-proven suspicion over Jenkinson's cannabis use and her history of self-harm was not shared between the schools, which would have been necessary to help ensure her move was a success.\nThe review said police chose not to take any further action and to support the Culcheth High School\u2019s intervention after the spiked pupil declined to a make a complaint.\nDespite that, it found an officer should have visited Jenkinson and her parents to make it clear this was a \"serious offence\", which would have also allowed them to \"assess family dynamics\".\nIn conclusion, it said \"practitioners\" who knew Jenkinson before the murder \"were not aware of anything that would have made them think that she was a serious risk to others\".\n\"They did not know of Scarlett\u2019s fascination with violent acts,\" it said.\n\"They saw no reason to be concerned about any contact with Brianna that they knew about.\"\nThe review made a series of recommendations over how agencies handle the moving of

they have addressed their learning in terms of home visits and seek assurance from each agency involved in the review that learning points had been identified and actioned.\nA representative for WSP,

    "Two polar bears killed a worker at a remote Arctic radar station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory,  prompting an investigation into the rare fatal attack.\nThe employee, who has not been named, was working for Nasittuq Corporation - a logistics company which operates radar defence sites on behalf of the Canadian government.\nOther workers responded to the scene and killed one of the bears, the company said in a statement.\n\"We are working closely with local authorities and regulatory agencies to conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding this incident,\" the company said.\n\"The safety and well-being of our employees is our highest priority, and we are deeply committed to ensuring a safe working environment.\" \nThe attack took place last week on Brevoort Island, southeast of Baffin Island.\nThe site is one of dozens of North Warning System outposts in northern Canada, according to CBS News, the BBC's partner in the US.\nThe network, which spans 3,100 miles (5,000km), exists to detect aircraft or missiles entering the region. \nPolar bear attacks on humans are extremely rare, but this is at least the second recorded deadly incident involving a polar bear attack since 2023. \nLast year, a woman and her 1-year-old son were killed by a polar bear in an Alaskan village.\nThere are about 17,000 polar bears living in the country - making up around two-thirds of the global population of the species, according to the Canadian government.\nThe species is in decline, and scientists attribute it to the loss of sea ice caused by global warming - leading to shrinking of their hunting and breeding grounds.\nElsewhere, a three-year-old girl in the US state of Montana was dragged out of her tent at a private campground by a black bear on Sunday.\nWildlife officials have set traps, and euthanised one bear believed to have been involved in the attack.\nBlack bears are much smaller than polar bears but can still be very dangerous to humans.\nIn 2023, a woman in California was fatally attacked and eaten inside her home, marking the first death by a black bear in the state's history.

    "A citizen science water quality project, which previously was funded by grants, will go ahead this summer after organisers said they would pay for it themselves.\nThe Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) has completed eight rounds of water quality surveys in Windermere, Cumbria, since 2022. \nThis year it failed to raise the funds it previously had from bodies such as the Environment Agency (EA), National Trust and Westmorland and Furness Council.\nThe National Trust said it was \"unable to fully fund the survey\", the council said its water budget for Windermere had already been allocated and the EA said it had to \"make tough decisions about where to allocate our funding\". \nWindermere, England's largest lake, is ecologically important and home to rare fish species such as the Arctic charr.\nIn May, the BBC revealed millions of litres of raw sewage had been illegally pumped into the lake earlier in the year.\nFor the quarterly survey, run alongside Lancaster University, volunteers collect water samples from more than 100 different locations which are then analysed for nutrient and bacterial levels.\nIn June, the FBA launched a campaign to raise the \u00a330,000 required for this summer's survey. \nA FBA spokesperson said at the time the group was trying to establish a \"blended funding model\" to buffer against the fluctuating availability of financing from charities and other groups. \nBut earlier this month it said it had only raised about \u00a38,500 and so would fund the survey itself. \n\"This is a decision that comes at a financial cost,\" a spokesperson said, adding that the group hoped to find a way to sustainably fund the project for the years to come.\nThe National Trust said it had stepped in last summer to fund the survey but could not do so this year. \nIt said the survey was a \"vital example of citizen science in action\" and that its staff and volunteers would be involved in the project.\nWestmorland and Furness Council said it was committed to the \"goal of improving water quality in Windermere\" but its budget for such issues had already been allocated this year, including \u00a341,000 for the FBA.\n\"[This] meant that we were unable to provide additional support for the summer survey,\" it said.\nThe survey will run on 8 September. \nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A snake thought to be a royal python is at large after its escape and has been spotted several times in a park.\nPeople were urged not to approach the reptile if they saw it in Ley Hill Park, Northfield, Birmingham, but report sightings to the RSPCA.\nInitially believed to be a boa constrictor, the manager of the Birmingham Wildlife Conservation Park said the snake \"appears\" to be a royal python.\nThe snake was about five feet (1.5m) long and not thought to be dangerous but should be left alone, the Friends of Ley Hill Park group said.\nLes Basford, manager of the Birmingham Wildlife Conservation Park, which is based about five miles from Ley Hill Park, said: \"If you went up to it and surprised it, it could strike but generally they are very passive. \n\"With all snakes it's best just to leave it alone and get professional advice. \n\"More than likely it's someone's pet.

    "Tattoos have been a staple in human culture for thousands of years, but their popularity has soared in recent decades.\nStereotypes of tattoos being only for \"inked criminals\" and \"the unemployed\" have gradually become obsolete as body art becomes more mainstream, with everyone from professionals to celebrities proudly displaying their designs.\nBut despite their prevalence, tattoos run more than just skin deep. They can often provide a glimpse into the psyche of the wearer.\nIt has increasingly become a way for people to \"reclaim\" their bodies and overcome insecurities, trauma, or a negative body-image by transforming their skin into art.\nWarning: This feature contains some potentially distressing images.\nIn 2015, 57-year-old Mandy Nicolson was diagnosed with scarring alopecia.\nAlso called cicatricial alopecia, the condition causes permanent hair loss after the immune system attacks and destroys the follicles.\n\"As a woman you take great pride in your hair,\" said Ms Nicolson, who lives in West Coker, Somerset.\n\"It's what women are meant to look like. They're meant to fit in this box with long beautiful hair, but that's not me.\"\nMs Nicolson said for a long time she felt \"trapped\" under the pressure of wearing headscarves to cover her bald spots, or never leaving the house without makeup after her eyebrow hairs began to fall out.\nIn 2021, Ms Nicolson decided to \"take back control\" by getting a tattoo of a dandelion clock in the place her alopecia first began- to represent her hair \"flying away\".\n\"I can't control what's happened to my hair, it's gone and it's never coming back,\" Ms Nicolson said.\n\"It took me a long time to accept that, I was distraught. But then I realised I can't do anything about it so I might as well embrace it.\"\nMs Nicolson says the tattoo helped her to \"redefine femininity\" into meaning bravery, boldness and resilience.\nShe said: \"I'm a woman, why can't I look how I want to? Why should I conform to a box of what people think I should look like? \n\"Now I proudly hold my head up. My tattoo gave me my freedom back.\" \nLuiza Machado Dias Dominguez, a tattoo artist at No Regrets studio in Bristol, has seen many clients come to her seeking a confidence boost.\n\"Whenever people come in with an insecurity they're usually covering them, even if it's hot outside,\" she said. \n\"But once the tattoo is finished you can see from their face that you've completely changed their lives. \n\"They can't wait to show it off, they are so proud of it. I've had a few of my clients hugging me and crying. I feel so privileged to be a part of that process.\" \nThe artist, who has been tattooing for eight years, says getting inked is \"more than just an accessory\". \n\"It's like you suddenly have this choice to show off who you really are, or who you want to be,\" she said.\nWhen tattooing over a burn or scar, Ms Dominguez advised first checking with your doctor on the condition of the skin to avoid the ink bleeding or the needle reopening healing tissue.\nBut rushing out to get a tattoo if you're unhappy with a part of your body is not a recommended way of dealing with self-esteem issues in the long run.\nAleksandra Pamphlett, a psychotherapist specialising in body image, says although tattoos can be used as a powerful tool to mark milestones along the \"self-healing journey\", they should not become an avoidance strategy.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be just a physical thing, it's psychological,\" she says.\n\"If you don\u2019t like your scars, or your stretch marks, there is a subconscious reason why you can\u2019t accept them. \n\u201cPeople see a huge imperfection in their eyes and they feel the need to hide. \n\"You\u2019re keeping trauma within that scar, and covering it won't make it go away.\"\nHowever, Ms Pamplett says she has seen many clients use tattoos as a way to \"take back power\" after battling chronic illness, mental health struggles, or trauma in their past.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very often about those invisible scars,\" she said.\n\"I\u2019ve seen women who have decided to get a tattoo after being abused or assaulted, to feel like they can reclaim their body- they own it, it's their choice, they\u2019re in control.\"\nAnother of her clients covered a large discoloured scar on her neck from a skin graft to make her feel \"less exposed\". \n\"After getting a tattoo, she didn\u2019t mind people looking at her anymore,\" Ms Pamphlett said. \n\"She was completely comfortable drawing that attention to herself, because it was on her terms.\"\nKieran Moulton, a PhD student at the University of the West of England, has conducted multiple studies into tattooing as a method of \"camouflaging or decorating\" scars.\nHe said one man, who was left with scarring after accidentally putting his hand through a window, had gotten shards of glass tattooed around the scar to represent how it was caused. \n\"A lot of the time, acquiring a scar might be something that's completely out of your control,\" said Mr Moulton.\n\"So you almost tattoo it to make it your own, to take back that part of your body.\" \nWhile Mr Moulton's studies focus",

    "A London bishop has written to the justice secretary about what she describes as a \"miscarriage of justice\" following the conviction and jailing of a man for murder.\nJason Moore had denied the 2005 fatal stabbing of Robert Darby in east London, but was convicted and jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years in 2013.\nThe Bishop of Stepney, the Rt Revd Dr Joanne Grenfell, told Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood in a letter to take urgent and direct action to review the case, with both men's families believing Moore is innocent.\nThe Ministry of Justice said it would respond to the letter in due course.\nMr Darby had been found with a stab wound in Ilford on 24 August 2005 and died the following day in hospital.\nBishop Grenfell said in her letter she was approached by both Mr Darby and Moore's families, who live in north and east London, \"because they believed that the church would care about an issue of justice\".\n\"In a remarkable display of unity, both families have joined forces to try to quash Jason\u2019s conviction, as they both believe he is innocent of Robert\u2019s murder,\" she added.\nIt comes after the justice secretary said Helen Pitcher, who heads up the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), was \"unable to fulfil her duties\" following the publication of a review into the case of Andrew Malkinson, whose rape conviction was overturned last year after a 20-year fight.\nThe bishop argued there had been repeated \"failures\" by the CCRC in investigating potential miscarriages of justice, including in Moore's case.\nShe wrote that in his case, these included \"lack of DNA evidence, the inconsistencies and unreliability of eyewitness testimony, and the failure to disclose key pieces of information to the defence\".\n\"Jason Moore, like Andrew Malkinson, was convicted solely on eyewitness evidence, with no forensics ever linking him to his supposed crime,\" Bishop Grenfell added.\n\"He was picked from a line-up by a single eyewitness, seven years after the crime.\"\nThe bishop explained the CCRC rejected Moore's case in 2021, \"refusing at first to even to investigate it\".\nThis was \"based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the most basic facts\", she said.\n\"In its rejection letter, the CCRC falsely asserted that two eyewitnesses had implicated Jason as Robert Darby's stabber.\n\"In fact, it was only one eyewitness, with significant credibility problems,\" she said.\nDespite this, she added, the CCRC \"refused to order fresh DNA testing and refused to reinterview the witness\", and said a local newspaper reporter had found the witness instead, who \"then admitted on tape that he had been drunk when he witnessed the stabbing and might have picked out the wrong man\".\nBishop Grenfell also highlighted that retired Metropolitan Police detective Steve Hobbs had written in his report to the CCRC there was a \"compelling trend of evidence and intelligence that suggest Jason Moore did not stab Robert Darby\u201d.\nShe ended her letter by saying both she and Moore's sister would be \"more than willing to meet\" with the minister to discuss the case further.\nSpeaking after sending the letter, Bishop Grenfell said: \u201cIt is not just Jason who maintains his innocence, but his family and the victim\u2019s family. \n\"That any one of us could be imprisoned under Jason\u2019s circumstances is a disturbing enough thought, but that we would then spend years waiting to even have our case reviewed is harrowing. \n\"I hope that the government will do what its predecessor did not.\u201d\nA CCRC spokesperson said: \u201cWe have received an application in relation to this case and a review is under way. \n\"It would be inappropriate for us to make any further comment at this stage.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Metropolitan Police said it had reviewed information in relation to the case in 2021, and added the force would \"assess any new information that becomes apparent\".\n\"This investigation remains closed, but should the circumstances change, we will assess them and consider the most appropriate way to manage any developments in this investigation.\n\"The Met has subsequently been informed by the CCRC that the case will not be referred to the Court of Appeal.\"\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has also been contacted for a response.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A group of breastfeeding mothers have been enlisted by Dublin Zoo to try to help an orangutan bond with her newborn.\nThe zoo's 19-year-old orangutan, Mujur, gave birth to a healthy male baby at the end of July but has not been feeding.\nOver the past few months, the zoo arranged for 30 new mothers to take turns to breastfeed their children in front of the pregnant orangutan, as part of a lactation learning process.\nMujur previously gave birth to two babies, in 2019 and 2022, but the zoo said she \"did not exhibit the necessary maternal qualities\" and both died.\nLizzie Reeves is a clinical midwife and a specialist in lactation at the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin.\nShe was approached by a vet at the zoo to advise on lactation in Mujur\u2019s case.\n\"It was a bit of a match made in heaven,\" she said. \"Obviously with my area of expertise and I love these animals.\"\nShe convinced eight colleagues at the hospital to help out with the project then messaged a groupchat to ask for volunteers.\n\"My phone wouldn\u2019t stop pinging\" she said. \nBy the next day, 30 women had signed up and a rota was created for the mothers to visit the zoo with their babies. \nThe first woman involved was her friend Nora Murphy, who visited Mujur in April with her now 10-month old daughter Elodi.\nThe team hoped that watching the women breastfeed their infants would teach Mujur how to feed her own baby when it arrived.\n\"Orangutans are known to mirror behaviour,\" Ms Reeves said. \n\"Mujur had so much interest in the women, she watched them so intensely and started to recognise people.\"\nMs Reeves also praised the women\u2019s commitment to the project.\n\"The women were amazing. They were so dedicated and so kind to Mujur,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"Even after the baby was born, three of the mothers came back and fed their babies in front of her.\n\"It was a really good example of women supporting women, regardless of species.\"\nThe zoo said it had left \"no stone unturned\" in its efforts to help Mujur develop maternal qualities.\nShe was also shown videos of other orangutans feeding their babies.\nAccording to the zoo, these efforts had some success and Mujur showed good maternal care towards her baby after the birth, but she was not putting him in the right position for breastfeeding. \nAs a result, the \"difficult decision\" had been made to bottle feed the baby orangutan.\nWhilst Mujur did not master breastfeeding, Ms Reeves said the project was still encouraging.\n\"You couldn\u2019t fault her mothering. She kissed him, cleaned him and she was so gentle with him,\" she said.\n\"Feeding was the last piece of the puzzle and we just didn\u2019t quite get there.\n\"With humans you can physically help them to hold the child and get the right position but with an animal this size, it\u2019s a totally different exercise.\"\nMs Reeves hopes the project could inspire similar work in the future.\nThe baby was fathered by Sibu, Dublin Zoo\u2019s orangutan patriarch, who died in February.\nOrangutans are a critically endangered species and Sibu\u2019s genetic profile is considered to be important for the orangutan European breeding programme.\nThe team at Dublin Zoo has \"fallen hopelessly in love\" with the baby - but hand-rearing him until independence is not a long-term option at the zoo.\nThe newborn will stay there for another few weeks before moving to a specialist institution in the UK, subject to necessary health checks. \nThe zoo said: \"It will be difficult to say goodbye, however we are confident that he is being sent to the best possible place for him to continue to develop and thrive.\"",
    "Scotland's chief inspector of prisons has called for radical options to be considered to reduce overcrowding, in her final report on the country's crisis-hit jails.\nWendy Sinclair-Gieben called for a bold and brave justice agenda with fewer people being sent to prison and more effective use of rehabilitation for people who are locked up.\nHer sixth and final annual report comes as Scotland has emergency measures in force to release prisoners early because there is no more space in the system.\nJustice Secretary Angela Constance said: \"We are taking action to deal with the pressures of a high and complex prison population, including the emergency release scheme approved by parliament and a consultation on release arrangements for long-term prisoners.\"\nShe added: \"We are also working with the prison service, NHS and others to ensure the prison population has the same level of healthcare as is offered in the community.\"\nMs Sinclair-Gieben said overcrowding was stubbornly entrenched in Scotland's prisons and remains the number one issue. \nScottish Prisons have a target operating capacity of 8,007.\nIn May, there were 8,346 prisoners incarcerated, a record level, including more than 700 with sentences of under 12 months.\nIt led the Scottish government to announce plans for early release of hundreds of prisoners.\nMs Sinclair-Gieben said she had warned as far back as 2020 that fewer people needed to be sent to prison or there would be a crisis.\nShe said the prison population was far in excess of the Scottish Prison Service's ability to provide a humane, rehabilitative experience.\nThe chief inspector praised the work that had been carried out on women's custody and said an equally ambitious approach should be taken to the rest of the prison system.\nShe said it might lead to fewer people being sent to prison, less time having to be spent in jail, more effective use of any time spent there and robust release planning and support.\nMs Sinclair-Gieben also said too many acutely mentally unwell people were being held in custody when they should be getting in-patient care.\nThe chief inspector called for \"a bold and brave transformational justice agenda\" to  to reduce the prison population.\nShe said this would allow the SPS to close some of its ageing and expensive buildings. \nScotland largest prison, Barlinnie in Glasgow, has been running at 140% capacity with just under 1,400 prisoners when it was designed for 987.\nA replacement for the 140-year-old jail was due to open in 2025 - but that has been pushed back to 2027.\nA site for the new jail, expected to have a capacity of about 1,200, was bought in 2020 and planning permission has been granted but building work has not yet started.\nA new prison in the Highlands - on a site near Inverness Campus - is expected to be completed in 2026 - six years later than originally planned.\nMs Sinclair-Gieben it would be a \"travesty\" to see any delay in the arrival of the much-needed prisons in Glasgow and Highland.\nA Scottish Prison Service spokesperson said: \"We welcome the chief inspector's final annual report and are thankful for the constructive challenge she has provided in the interests of those in our care, their families, our staff, and the justice sector as whole over the past six years.\n\"She cites many examples of how SPS staff work to support people, such as the growth of recovery cafes; the focus on reducing the demand for illicit substances; the many partnerships aimed at building skills and improving employment prospects; and the care and compassion shown every day, often in extremely challenging circumstances.\"\nThe spokesperson added: \"In particular, the chief inspector highlighted the excellent staff-prisoner relationships at HMP Greenock; the strong management and committed staff group at HMP Perth; the vision, energy, purpose, and direction brought to HMP & YOI Polmont, and HMP Edinburgh's impressive peer mentor system for new admissions.\n\"We share the chief inspector's ambition to go even further as we support rehabilitation, reduce the risk of reoffending, and help support safer communities.\"",
    "X can feel like two parallel universes at times.\nThere\u2019s the version where the president of the United States chooses the platform to announce he won\u2019t be running for re-election. That\u2019s the one where the worldwide authority on a particular subject uses X to offer their expert take on unfolding events.\nAnd then there\u2019s the version where false claims, hate and conspiracy theories, including many posts relating to the recent riots and protests across the UK, are recommended to millions who have made absolutely no attempt to seek them out.\nAt the centre of it all is X\u2019s owner Elon Musk, one of the world\u2019s richest people. But this isn\u2019t just a story about the monetisation strategy and algorithms employed by X under his tenure and how they are boosting divisive content.\nIt is increasingly also a story about how Mr Musk himself is choosing to wade in, overtly, to opine on unrest in the UK.\nAnd nobody is quite sure what his game plan is.\nMr Musk bought what was then called Twitter in 2022. In November 2023, the site reinstated the account of the previously banned far-right activist and convicted criminal, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson.\nThen this week, Mr Musk responded to a post from Yaxley-Lennon with two exclamation marks - in other words, stirring the pot. \nYaxley-Lennon had taken aim at UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for his words after riots broke out following the murder of three girls in Southport. Yaxley-Lennon had accused the Prime Minister of labelling everyone upset about the murders as \u201cthugs\u201d. Mr Starmer\u2019s speech had specifically referred to thugs as being those throwing bricks at police officers.\nYaxley-Lennon had also been critical of the prime minister\u2019s comments about increasing policing powers in response to the riots.\nMr Musk then later went on to suggest, in response to a video of rioting, that \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said there was \u201cno justification\u201d for this claim.\nMr Musk doubled down again - responding to the prime minister\u2019s post about attacks on Muslim communities by asking: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\u201d And Mr Musk repeated the remark in a tweet of his own, making allegations about violence from anti-racist and Muslim counter-protesters and accusing the police of a \u201cone-sided\u201d approach.\nIt\u2019s not as if X didn\u2019t already contain plenty of content around events in Southport before Mr Musk\u2019s interventions.\nFalse claims that the person responsible for the killings in Southport was a Muslim refugee who arrived in the UK by boat in 2023 spread like wildfire across X. They then spilled out on to other social media platforms and were also posted on some Telegram channels - but much of the most frenzied, amplified conversation was happening on X.\nThe claims were shared by pseudo-news accounts, profiles with a track record of promoting evidence-free conspiracy theories about everything from the pandemic and vaccines to wars - and then also by prominent political commentators, politicians and influencers.\nThe profiles reaching the most users with these ideas had often purchased blue ticks meaning their posts were granted more prominence on the platform.\nMr Musk, with his own blue tick and 193 million followers, has been interacting with some profiles sharing divisive content and, in doing so, amplifying their message.\nThere\u2019s not currently a definitive answer as to what is driving Mr Musk.\nHis presence as an active player on his own platform is certainly keeping X talked about. \nFor all the furore around his ownership of X, last month the site said it had 251 million global daily active users in the second quarter of this year, an increase of 1.6% from the same period of the previous year. Of course, this can be attributed to a range of factors - like what\u2019s happening in the world. While these figures represented a drop in growth, X is still a focal point for digital conversations.\nFor all the warnings that X would cease to exist under Elon Musk, a variety of different users are continuing to post - including many world leaders and prominent political figures of all stripes.\nIt may also have something to do with Mr Musk\u2019s views on threats of regulation - and in the UK specifically, the Online Safety Act, which was passed under the previous government. \nWhen this comes into full effect in 2025 it will require social media firms to remove illegal content, including where it is \"racially or religiously aggravated\". Mr Musk has repeatedly been vocal about his concerns that attempts by governments to regulate social media sites - like his own - risk infringing freedom of speech.\nOthers wonder if he has simply spent too much time on X. Sander van der Linden, a professor of social psychology at the University of Cambridge, has suggested that Mr Musk may be \u201cradicalising himself on his own platform\u201d.\nOf course, the reasons for the protests and riots in the UK clearly extend far beyond social media.\nIt\u2019s also the case",
    "Ukraine's military says it attacked and destroyed a Russian submarine while it was anchored at a port in the occupied Crimean peninsula. \nThe Rostov-on-Don, a Kilo-class attack submarine launched in 2014, sank after it was struck in a missile attack on the port city of Sevastopol on Friday, Ukraine's general staff said in a statement. \nIt was reportedly one of four submarines operated by Russia's Black Sea fleet capable of launching Kalibr cruise missiles. The Russian defence ministry has not commented. \nOfficials in Kyiv said the attack also destroyed four S-400 air defence systems protecting the peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. \nIntelligence officials in the UK noted last September that the Rostov-on-Don \"likely suffered catastrophic damage\" in a missile strike while undergoing maintenance at a Sevastopol shipyard. \nUkraine's military said Russia subsequently repaired the vessel and it was recently testing its capabilities near Sevastopol. The vessel was worth $300m (\u00a3233m), they added. \n\"The destruction of Rostov-on-Don once again proves that there is no safe place for the Russian fleet in the Ukrainian territorial waters of the Black Sea,\" the general staff in Kyiv said in a statement on Saturday. \nIt marks the latest attack on Russian naval forces in Sevastopol in recent months. In March alone, Ukraine said it hit two landing ships and a patrol vessel in the port city. \nSince Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 it has suffered several major naval setbacks. Ukraine says it has seriously damaged or sunk at least 15 warships, including the Black Sea fleet's flagship, the Moskva. \nLast week Ukraine's military said Moscow had been forced to withdraw all of its naval assets from the Sea of Azov - a body of water connected to the Black Sea - due to repeated strikes on its vessels. \nAnd Russia's internal security service, the FSB, recently said it foiled a Ukrainian plot to destroy its last remaining aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov. The ship, launched in 1985, has been undergoing repairs since 2018. \nMeanwhile, officials in Kyiv said Ukrainian drones targeted a major airfield and oil depots in Russia. \nThe attack targeted the Morozovsk airfield, where guided bombs which have recently wreaked havoc on Ukrainian cities, are stored. \nOnline footage said to be from the base showed powerful explosions and huge fires, after what appears to be several hits on fuel or ammunition depots. Russia said many of the drones used were shot down, but local authorities have declared a state of emergency around the air base.\nOil storage facilities were also targeted in the Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod regions. \nThe attacks come after Russia launched more than 600 guided air bombs towards Ukraine in a week, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. \nHe said that it was crucial that Ukraine stopped Russian aircraft from launching the munitions and said that attacking airfields in Russia to do so was \"quite fair\". \nUkraine's allies have previously been reluctant to allow it to strike within Russia using Western weapons, though the US has recently granted Kyiv permission to attack some targets along the border. \nEarlier this week Lithuania's foreign minister said the first deliveries of F-16 fighter jets had arrived in Ukraine. Long promised by Kyiv's Nato allies, President Zelenky views the planes as central to his country's air defence plans. \nThe Times newspaper reported that six jets donated by the Netherlands had arrived in the country, but Dutch defence officials declined to comment when approached by the BBC earlier this week. \nOfficials in Kyiv will also hope that the jets can help arrest Russian momentum on the frontlines. Moscow's forces have been making incremental gains in the east of the country for several weeks. \n",

    "The children of a Russian spy couple who returned home on Thursday after the largest prisoner swap between the West and Russia since the Cold War only found out their nationality on the flight to Moscow.\nArtem Viktorovich Dultsev and Anna Valerevna Dultseva were posing as an Argentine couple living in Slovenia when they were jailed there. \nTheir children do not speak a word of Russian and did not know who President Vladimir Putin was, asking their parents who was greeting them upon their arrival, the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\nIn total, 24 people jailed in seven different countries were exchanged on Thursday.\nSixteen were Western prisoners detained in Russian jails and eight were Russian prisoners held in the US, Norway, Germany, Poland and Slovenia. Among them was Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.\nThe Russian family of four were warmly welcomed, with Mrs Dultseva and her daughter receiving flowers and a warm embrace from President Putin.\n\"Buenas noches,\" the president said to the spies' children, as he greeted them in Spanish.\nAs reported by Argentinian media, the couple were known as Mar\u00eda Mayer and Ludwig Gisch and arrived in Slovenia sporting their Argentinian passports in 2017.\nThe husband set up a start-up IT company under his alias name and the wife had an online art gallery.  \nThe family used Ljubljana as their base and it was not until 2022 that the couple were arrested by Slovenian police on espionage charges.\nAhead of the large scale prisoner swap, Mr Dultsev and Mrs Dultseva were sentenced to 19 months in prison each, after pleading guilty to spying charges on Wednesday. But given their arrests in 2022, they were released on time served and ordered to leave Slovenia, as reported by the Associated Press.\nIt was not until Thursday, during the large scale Russia-West prisoner swap, that the Kremlin spies, and their children, were returned to Russia.\nLife for 11-year-old Sofia and 8-year-old Gabriel, who were born in Argentina, changed thereafter and they only learnt they were Russian when the plane set off from Ankara to Vnukovo Airport, the Kremlin said.\n\u201cThe children of the undercover agents asked their parents yesterday who had greeted them,\u201d Mr Peskov said, adding: \u201cThey did not even know who Putin is.\u201d\nThe Kremlin spokesman said that is how undercover agents (or \"illegals\") work, \"making such sacrifices for the sake of their work and their dedication to their service\".\nUnlike \"legal\" spies, who are posted abroad under diplomatic or other official cover, illegals are on their own - working normal jobs, living in suburbs and operating without the diplomatic immunity enjoyed by other agents should they be caught.",
    "Campaigners have rallied in Grangemouth in a bid to secure the future of the oil refinery.\nRefinery owners Petroineos have set out plans to cease operations at Grangemouth by 2025, putting 400 jobs at risk with more job losses in the wider supply chain.\nTrade union Unite said hundreds of supporters from all over Scotland marched to support the 'Keep Grangemouth Working' campaign.\nThey gathered at Grangemouth stadium before marching to Zetland Park for a rally.\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme ahead of the march, Unite organiser Lorna Robertson said all eyes were on Grangemouth on Saturday.\n\"We\u2019ve seen a change in the last few months since we\u2019ve had a new UK government and a new first minister in Scotland,\" she said.\n\"The general secretary of Unite has been having positive talks with the new UK government and ourselves up here with the Scottish government and I think there is a willingness now to work with the company to see if the life span of the refinery can be extended.\n\"We want to bring together everyone who has supported our campaign, the community of Grangemouth have been really positive about the campaign and there's been a real willingness to come together, so this is the act of coming together today,\" she added.\nGrangemouth is one of six refineries in the UK and the only one in Scotland.\nIt is the oldest refinery in the UK. It opened in the 1920s, expanded into petrochemicals in the 1950s, and is in need of an expensive overhaul.\nIt accounts for about 14% of the UK's overall refining capacity and supplies almost two-thirds (65%) of demand for refined oil products in Scotland.\nWhile the petrochemical plant is wholly owned by Ineos, the refinery is owned by Petroineos - a joint venture between Ineos and PetroChina.\nIt is currently the primary supplier of aviation fuel for Scotland's main airports, and a major supplier of petrol and diesel ground fuels across the central belt.\nPetroineos announced its intention to shut down the refinery in November, saying Grangemouth had been facing significant challenges because of global market pressures.\nIneos said the plant is competing with newer and more efficient refineries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. \nA company spokesman said: \"In the medium term we forecast dramatically reduced demand for key fuels we produce. We are seeing this in the market today as a result of more efficient engines and transport electrification initiatives. \n\"This will accelerate following the ban on new build petrol and diesel cars coming into effect in 2030 in Scotland.\"\nPetroineos plans to transform the refinery into an import terminal for fuel from other countries.\nAbout 2,000 people are directly employed at the site including 500 at the refinery, 450 on the Forties pipeline from the North Sea and a further 1,000 in the Ineos petrochemicals business.\nSome 100 staff would be needed for the planned fuels import terminal - which Petroineos said would be able to bring petrol, diesel, aviation fuel and kerosene into Scotland.\nIt said the timescale for the transition had \"not yet been determined\". The work was expected to take about 18 months.\nPetroineos said it was working closely on the project with a \"range of interested parties\" including the Scottish and UK governments and would provide more information in due course.\nScottish Green MSP for Central Scotland, Gillian Mackay, grew up near the refinery and said workers at Grangemouth are some of the most talented and skilled anywhere in Scotland.\nShe said: \u201cWhat has happened recently at Grangemouth is the exact opposite of a just and fair transition for workers.\n\u201cWe need the Scottish and UK governments to work with trade unions and the community to do everything they can to end the instability and support local people.\n\u201cThe just transition can\u2019t be a slogan, it has to provide real jobs and opportunities, and Grangemouth can and must be a blueprint of that collaborative and managed transition in action.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the department of energy, security and net zero said: \u201cWe\u2019re determined to do all we can in seeking a future for the Grangemouth site.\n\u201cWe will be immediately funding work to explore options for a sustainable future for the site, working side-by-side with the Scottish government and the local community.\u201d",

    "Zorel Morales is worried about 130,000 tonnes of toxic material.\nThe substance in question is partially processed copper ore, and it has been stuck at a closed copper mine in Panama since the end of last year.\n\u201cThe chemical reactions that generate dangerous gases, and a rise in the material\u2019s temperatures, pose environmental risks,\u201d says Mr Morales, who is the head of Panama\u2019s Chamber of Mining. He adds that it \u201cthreatens the health and safety of staff\u201d still working at the operation.\nThe substance, called \u201ccopper concentrate\u201d, is finely ground copper ore that has been treated to increase its copper content ahead of going on to be exported for smelting into refined copper.\nIn addition to the danger of the release of toxic sulphur dioxide gas, just being exposed to dust particles from the concentrate can damage a person\u2019s respiratory system. And it is toxic to aquatic life.\nThe material has been left at the site of Cobre Panam\u00e1, a huge open pit copper mine closed since last December, when the country\u2019s supreme court ruled that a new 20-year concession to operate the facility was unconstitutional. \nAfter the ruling the government quickly forced the mine to shut, leaving just maintenance staff at the facility.\nThe order came after thousands of people took to the nation\u2019s streets last October and November to protest against the mine, which they said was harming the environment.\nThe facility, one of the world\u2019s largest copper mines, employed some 7,000 people, and accounted for 1% of the world\u2019s copper production. It opened in 2019, and is owned by Canadian firm First Quantum Minerals.\nListen now - Panama's troubled copper mine\nLocated deep in a tropical rainforest near Panama\u2019s Caribbean Coast, First Quantum has invested $10bn (\u00a37.8bn) in the mine, including new infrastructure like roads, buildings and machinery.\nThe company wants to be able to export the existing concentrate. It has filed two international arbitration claims against Panama, although it says that its preferred route is to open dialogue with the new Panamanian government that came to power in July.\nThe dispute over the concentrate centres on who owns it \u2013 the Canadian company or Panama.\n\u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with the new government to address the situation in relation to the mine,\u201d says First Quantum spokesperson Maru G\u00e1lvez, in a statement.\n\u201cIn particular, it is important to resolve the status of the copper concentrate that remains at the mine site and which all parties have agreed is an urgent matter.\u201d\nIn response, a government spokesman says they are still assessing the situation and aren\u2019t giving interviews. The new president, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, has yet to give a clear message about how he wants to resolve the issue.\nOne of Panama\u2019s former finance ministers, Dulcidio de la Guardia, says he is frustrated by the situation.\n\u201cCobre Panam\u00e1 was the most important foreign investment in the country, second to the Panama Canal,\u201d says Mr la Guardia, who held that cabinet position from 2014 to 2019. \u201cIt accounted for 5% of the GDP, which is around $5bn in direct and indirect contributions to the economy.\u201d\nMichael Camacho is a leader of the Utramipa mining union, and one of 1,400 people still working at Cobre Panam\u00e1 as part of the maintenance programme. This is costing First Quantum about $15m to $20m a month.\nMr Camacho wants to see the government approve a plan for the preservation and safe operation of the mine. \u201cIn December more than 6,000 miners were left out of work when operations stopped. I urge the new president, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, to listen to the concerns of the communities around the mine who want to go back to work.\u201d\nBut, environmental activist Raisa Banfield, who was involved in the demonstrations that led to the mine\u2019s closure, is adamant that it remaining shut is in the best interests of the country. \u201cThe future of Panama isn\u2019t from mining. The future of Panama is its biodiversity.\u201d\nShe thinks the country needs a new kind of business model. \u201cI think we\u2019re re-finding our identity away from big projects like the Panama Canal, and foreign companies taking our resources to satisfy their economic model.\u201d\nShe and other demonstrators got support from climate activist Greta Thunberg and Hollywood actor Leonardo Di Caprio, who both shared a video calling for the \u201cmega mine\u201d to stop its operations.\nMs Banfield wants the new government to instead invest in infrastructure for eco-tourism so Panama can flourish like neighbouring Costa Rica.\nYet others think the mine\u2019s closure wasn\u2019t just about the environment. Samuel Vald\u00e9s is a biologist and the owner of the Biodiversity Consultant Group, which was employed by First Quantum to do studies to help minimise the environmental impact of the vast facility.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of misinformation surrounding the mine,\u201d he says. Mr Vald\u00e9s argues that some of the opposition to the facility was an extension of suspicions about the former government.\n\u201cMany people thought the last government was co",

Are they a dangerous eyesore, or is the lock-laden bridge a monument worth preserving?\nJamie Allen knew he didn't have long to live when he attached a love lock to Weir Bridge in the picturesque town of Bakewell.\nHis new wife, Sara, stood beside him but was too upset to help him attach it.\nShe had given him the lock on their wedding day only a week before.\n\"It was quite emotional for him knowing that I would be going back on my own or with his family,\" says Sara.\nThey had been together for eight years when Jamie was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in July 2023.\nThey decided to marry on 27 September, and he died three months later to the day, aged 52.\nSara now visits the bridge every two weeks and was due to visit with some of his relatives on their wedding anniversary.\nBut Derbyshire County Council is due to remove all of the locks for maintenance of the bridge before that can happen, melt them down, then change the railings to stop more being attached in future.\nThe decision has saddened Sara, who says visiting the bridge brings her \"peace\".\n\"I can't even explain it,\" she says. \"It's just knowing that James [the name she called him] put it on.\n\"He was the love of my life, I'd waited so long to meet someone special like him.\"\nHundreds, if not thousands, of other people have stories similar to Sara's.\nThe footbridge was built over the River Wye about 25 years ago, but locks first appeared in 2012.\nMike Hall placed a lock there with his wife Carol back in 2014.\nAt that point, they had been married for 32 years, but Mike says they were \"in love as much then as we were when we first met as childhood sweethearts\".\nAs the years passed, they lost sight of their padlock as the global trend for love locks spread and thousands of other locks appeared on the bridge.\nSoon, the railings of the bridge were so crammed that new locks could only be attached by fastening them to the existing ones.\nMike recalls trying to find theirs every time they walked over the bridge, while Carol patiently waited.\nThey never found it again, and Carol died from cancer on 28 September 2020.\nBut to his astonishment, Mike then managed to find the lock when he completed a 1,000-mile walk on their 39th wedding anniversary - their first since she died, and seven years after they first placed the lock together.\n\"I was in tears on the bridge and was comforted by some young people that heard me shout out 'I've found it',\" he said.\n\"They didn\u2019t have to stop, they didn't have to show concern, but they did and they helped me photograph it, so they are part of my story now.\n\"Was it fate that I found the padlock on our anniversary, our first apart, was it destiny or was it her on the other side?\"\nFor Mike, the bridge isn't just a bridge.\n\"It's a living memorial of happy times and many other noteworthy events, and that's why it's so important to preserve this monument,\" he says.\nMike feels so strongly about the locks being removed, that he has written to the council asking for them to be moved somewhere else to create a memorial.\n\"We all know that something needs to be done and the council are in a difficult position trying to appease everyone,\" he says.\n\"A bridge is supposed to bring people together, not divide, but that seems to be what's happened.\n\"All we want to do is work with the council and residents to find a place that suits all, especially all that have an emotional connection with the locks, bridge and Bakewell.\"\nThis is something a campaign group called Save the Love Locks at Bakewell has also been asking the council to do, but it appears to be a bridge too far.\n\"We have in the past spoken to other organisations - because we don't own any of the suitable surrounding land - about other potentials for the locks, but that sadly hasn't come forward,\" says Councillor Charlotte Cupit, who is cabinet member for highways assets and transport.\nThe campaign group has queried why the locks can't be put back on the bridge after the maintenance work.\nMiss Cupit previously claimed that keeping the bridge lock-free will \"improve public safety\" because of the risk of \"grazes and cuts from protruding locks\".\n\"We've had complaints about it in the past and people obviously raising concerns about cuts and grazes, so it is something we have to factor in,\" she says.\nThe BBC asked the council's press office how many complaints had been made over the years, and it said \"we have received the occasional email\".\nAs well as public safety, the large numbers of padlocks have sparked concerns over accessibility.\nIt sometimes gets so busy that Bakewell resident Claire Wilson finds it difficult to cross in her wheelchair.\n\"So many people just stop to look at all the locks, and nobody ever looks behind them,\" she says.\n\"So as an electric wheelchair user, my chair doesn't stop instantly, so I've had quite a few near-misses.\"\nOn top of this, Claire believes t",
    "England star Mary Earps has become the first professional female footballer to have a wax figure at Madame Tussauds in London.\nThe 31-year-old goalkeeper played a key part of the Lionesses winning the European Championships in 2022 and reaching the World Cup final in 2023.\nShe was put forward for the waxwork honour following a public vote.\nEarps, who grew up in Nottingham, said she hoped the new figure would help to \"break barriers and push boundaries\".\n\"It's a special feeling to be a trailblazer. I think it's something that means a lot to me,\" she said.\n\"I'm a very ambitious person, a very hard-working person, and I think to try and push boundaries and try and be a pioneer for change, in many ways, is something that I really enjoy doing, and hopefully I can do for the rest of my career.\"\nThe Lioness said it was \"a bizarre one\" that members of the public had voted for her, but hopes the rest of her teammates would soon have their own wax figures at Madame Tussauds London to help inspire others.\n\"As Lionesses, one of the things that really sets us apart from other teams is how strong we are in our values and what we stand for,\" she added.\n\"I think we're really big on trying to inspire as many people as possible - young, old, all ages, all genders - and I think this is another extension of that, and we're constantly trying to break barriers and push boundaries.\"\nShe is most excited for her family to see her wax figure for the first time, particularly her grandmother who she joked might feel uneasy seeing a different version of Earps.\n\"I think that will be a real special moment for [my gran]. I'm not sure how she'll feel about there being two of me in the world, but we're about to find out,\" she said.\nEarps, who was awarded an MBE for her services to football in May, said she hopes her eyes, eyebrows and lashes are \"on point\".\nJo Kinsey, studio manager at Madame Tussauds London, said \"it was truly delightful\" having the opportunity to work with Earps for her first ever figure, which will be put on display in the autumn.\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A mother of six who has been on a waiting list for a bigger social home for eight years says \"every day is a struggle\".\nKarla Lee, from Monkstown in Newtownabbey, lives with her husband and six sons with additional needs - she currently sleeps on a mattress on the floor of a room that she shares with her five youngest sons.\n\"Living on top of each other is the hardest and all we are looking for is one extra bedroom,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"It's very difficult on a daily basis trying to manage the children in a confined space - apparently there are no four bedroom houses in the area.\"\nMrs Lee said it was frustrating as a mother \"that you can't provide a home that is suitable for your children\".\n\"You just do your best - that's all you can do as a mummy, which I don't feel is enough,\" she added.\n\"I understand the budget problem, but eight years is a long time out of my life and my children's lives that I haven't been able to be a mummy and provide for my children what they need.\"\nThe money available for new build social housing was sharply cut in Stormont's April budget.\nThere will only be enough to start building less than a third of the 2,000 target.\nCouncillor Aaron Skinner, who has been working with Karla and her family, said it was a \"disgrace\" they had been waiting this long.\n\"They deserve a proper home that meets the family's needs close to their support network,\" he said.\n\"We simply aren't building homes big enough for their family in that area.\"\nMrs Lee is one of more than 47,000 people on a waiting list for social housing.\nNorthern Ireland Federation of Housing Association chief executive Seamus Leheny said there was a \"crisis\".\nThe budget for building new social homes in Northern Ireland this year was cut by more than 70%, which means there will only be the money to build about 400 new homes.\n\"We're not building enough social homes, we're not building enough affordable homes,\" he said.\n\"People point the finger and look at Dublin where there is a housing crisis. We are going to follow in the footsteps of Dublin and we need to learn the lesson from Dublin and tackle the problem now before it gets worse.\"\nNorthern Ireland has seen a slowdown in both social and private housebuilding.\nNew figures show there has been a slight improvement in the number of homes that were built across Northern Ireland in recent months.\nThere were 3,375 new starts in the second quarter of this year, up from 2,927 at the same time last year.\nOfficial data published by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency earlier this year suggested housebuilding fell to a 60-year low in 2023, with just 5,379 new dwellings completed during the year, including 570 social houses.\nPlanning permission data also suggests there is no sign of supply increasing.\nCommunities Minister Gordon Lyons said he would be asking for additional funding for social housing in the next monitoring round - a Stormont mini-budget.\nMonitoring rounds provide a system to review spending plans and are usually held three times a year, in January, June and October.\n\"I did secure additional funding in the last monitoring round but it's not enough - it's not acceptable and we need to do much more so I will continue to make the case for housing,\" Mr Lyons added.\n\"We have to look at alternative sources of funding as well and that's why I'm very keen to get the reclassification of the Housing Executive so it can borrow against its own assets.\"\nHe said it was also not just about more money, but addressing issues around matters such as planning, wastewater and public land.",

    "\"Dead reyt\", \"faff\" and \"keep gu'in\" are words you don\u2019t often see in video games.\nBut two pals from Yorkshire have changed all that.\nGod's Own Country, as the locals call it, is the inspiration for Thank Goodness You're Here!, a new game created by James Carbutt and Will Todd, from Barnsley.\nThe pair - aka development team Coal Supper - are the minds behind the fictional northern town of Barnsworth.\nPlayers pilot a tiny, silent character through a series of surreal odd-jobs given to them by local residents.\nIt's a deliberately weird experience, but it's also been hailed as hilariously funny and \"reyt proper Yorkshire\".\nOne of the first buildings players enter - the local pub, of course - has a blackboard outside advertising today's special.\n\"Drinks.\"\nIt's little touches like this, along with a script full of regional slang delivered in Yorkshire accents, that have led people to call Thank Goodness \"the most northern game ever\".\nBut how did it get made?\nWill and James, who provide voices for many characters in the game, say the distinctive script came naturally as they developed it.\n\"The more we worked on it, the more we started drawing out characters that just sounded more and more like us, because we're doing it in our voices,\" says Will.\nThe video games industry has been criticised for becoming more risk-averse and leaning into sequels and remakes as the cost of making blockbuster titles has increased.\nJames and Will admit that a lot of publishers were \"sceptical\" when they pitched their unique project to them.\n\"I think part of that was we were obviously trying to shirk traditional game design,\" says Will.\n\"Tropes and genres and stuff. And it wasn't necessarily super-clear what the game was going to be.\"\nThey say the Yorkshire setting was a bit of a hurdle too.\nSome of the bigger indie game publishers are US-based and Will says there are \"assumptions about what Britishness is when you're pitching for funding\".\n\"Colin Firth and the rain British,\" says James.\n\"This is more like flat caps and whippets,\" adds Will.\nThey eventually signed a deal with Panic! - the publisher behind mega-hit Untitled Goose Game, which cast players as a wildfowl on a mission to cause havoc in a small village.\nThe publisher helped them to get IT Crowd and What We Do in the Shadows actor Matt Berry - known for his deadpan baritone - on board for a bit of star power.\nAnd they have made some allowances for an international audience.\n\"There's subtitles for people from Yorkshire and subtitles for proper English -  translation options for Southerners,\" says James. \n\"If we wrote the script in the dialect and then recorded everything, we had to go through and then put the proper English in,\" says Will.\nThank Goodness isn't the only high-profile game released this year to feature strong UK accents.\nHorror game Still Wakes the Deep, set on a North Sea oil rig in 1975, employs a mostly Scottish voice cast.\nCreative lead John McCormack says developers The Chinese Room agreed early on that they wanted the story of the ill-fated Beira D rig to feel \"like it actually happened\".\nAnd that meant no compromise on the way it sounded.\n\"To be authentic to the setting and the period there was only one way to do it,\" he says. \n\"And that was to hire the right voices for the story.\"\nJohn admits it will be \"hard to understand\" in places for some, but the performances help to convey the mood of a scene even when the audience doesn't understand every word. \n\"When you bring in realistic accents to double down on that authenticity, it just sort of solidifies the kind of sense of place,\" says John.\n\"So when the horror kicks in, it feels more real.\"\nJohn feels audiences have \"completely embraced\" the performances in Still Wakes the Deep, even if conventional wisdom suggests otherwise.\n\"When it comes to funding, when you're going to publishers and you're trying to sell your idea, it's generally looking for global appeal,\" he says.\n\"And in the gaming space that tends to be a clean American accent or kind of posh English accents or something that can be fully understood.\"\nJohn says that Still Wakes the Deep is relatively unusual because it's grounded in real-life, and many games are set in fantastical worlds where they aren't tied to a geographical location.\nBut he hopes projects placing regional voices front and centre will inspire others.\n\"If you've got a story to tell, and you want it to feel authentic, be specific and own the place that it's set,\" he says.\n\"The audience is intelligent, the audience will, as we've seen, they'll embrace that even more.\"\nSo far Thank Goodness You're Here! has had a positive response since its release on Thursday. \nBut Yorkshire lads Will and James are humble about their aspirations for it.\n\"It's something that we always dreamed about as kids,\" says Will. \n\"And I think other than massive financial success, I hope it finds an audience.\n\"It really is a love letter to the north and specifically our hometown. \n\"And we will be reaching a",
    "Wildlife rescue volunteers are urging people to stop buying toy flying rings as they are finding young seals with them stuck around their necks and say some have died as a result.\n\"They cut into the neck of the seals which leads to infection and, unfortunately, many do die,\" said Gareth Richards, founder of Gower Seal Group.\nIt started a campaign to discourage their use due to the number of discarded flying rings ending up on beaches in Swansea and the Gower Peninsula.\nWelfare charity RSPCA said it was a widespread problem, and could cost up to \u00a315,000 to treat an injured seal.\nWarning: Distressing images\nSwansea council is due to discuss what action it can take to help support the campaign at a meeting next month.\nMr Richards said the \"flying rings are sold so cheaply, often for a \u00a31 or \u00a32, that they often get lost or discarded on beaches and, inevitably, they end up in the sea\".\n\"You then get seals, younger seals specifically, that see these as a toy and those few moments of curiosity will turn into a lifetime of misery when these things go over their heads and they get stuck on their neck and they can't come off,\" he added.\nMr Richards wants people to stop buying the plastic rings and to use the \"solid traditional disk frisbee instead\".\nThe RSPCA said it is a serious issue around the coast.\nRehabilitating a seal requires a costly and \"long, long period of wound management\" with antibiotics and painkillers, according to senior wildlife officer Geoff Edmond.\n\"Eventually there's hope that that wound will heal and the animal can be returned to the wild,\" he said.\nGower Seal Group volunteer Elin Carter, who is studying environmental science at university,  says she decided to help after realising how harmful plastic items can be to marine life.\n\"Since starting volunteering I've seen lots of seals being washed up on beaches, either dead or with really bad injuries, stopping them from being able to swim and live life how they should be all because of plastic rings,\" she said.\nSwansea council leader Rob Stewart said the authority intends to discuss action at next month's full council meeting.\n\"The aim will be to raise awareness of the danger and to encourage local residents and visitors to our beaches to stop using flying ring frisbees - and to use solid disc frisbees instead - and, of course, to always take them home so they don't end up in our oceans,\" he said.

    "For a second day running, most of the front pages focus on the nationwide protests associated with far-right groups.\nThe Sunday Telegraph reports that courts are preparing to sit overnight and at weekends to fast-track the sentencing of offenders. The paper says ministers, police chiefs and senior members of the judiciary met last night to discuss the emergency measures. It says while the government's plan to speed up justice will help to quell the current violence, its efforts will be futile if the current pressure on prisons means Britain adopts a ''catch and release strategy''.\nThe former Armed Forces Minister, John Spellar, tells the Sunday Express that the courts must back the police in making it ''unmistakably clear'' that the unrest must not continue, adding that ''stiff custodial sentences'' are needed.\nThe paper also reports that the Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, is preparing to call in the Army if rioting continues, because of concerns that police forces could become overwhelmed and exhausted.\nFour thousand extra riot police are on standby to deal with further disorder, according to the Sunday Times, which has spoken to the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council.  One of its senior officers warns that ''if you've been involved in the rioting but haven't been arrested yet, your time will come.''\nThe UK is in the middle of a \"summer of discontent\" according to the Mail on Sunday. The paper says the government's failure to grasp the dangers of its migration policies has created the circumstances in which dangerous internet rumours can spread and ignite. It says ''a general mistrust of the state has grown like an infestation of weeds''.\nThe Observer reports that so-called anti-strike laws - introduced by the previous Conservative government - are due to be scrapped ''within days''. The paper says departments have been told they should ''ignore'' the law, which aims to force the likes of border security workers and railway staff to provide a minimum level of service. The deputy prime minister Angela Rayner tells the paper that the policy had succeeded \u201conly in poisoning industrial relations\u201d.\nIn the Daily Mail, former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith describes the move as ''the beginning of radical change that will give power to the unions to strike at will''.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

    "Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus - a longtime political foe of Bangladesh's ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina - has been named the country's interim leader.\nThe 84-year-old was appointed a day after Ms Hasina fled the country following weeks of deadly protests that brought her resignation.\nWhile Prof Yunus has been lauded for his pioneering use of microloans, Ms Hasina regarded him as a public enemy - he is currently on bail, appealing against a six-month jail term in what he has called a politically-motivated case.\nStudents who led the mass protests that unseated Ms Hasina refused to accept a military-led government and pushed for Prof Yunus to lead the interim administration.\nThe decision to name Prof Yunus as chief adviser of the interim government followed a meeting between President Mohammed Shahabuddin, military leaders and student leaders.\n\"When the students who sacrificed so much are requesting me to step in at this difficult juncture, how can I refuse?\" Prof Yunus had said.\nHe is returning to Dhaka from Paris where he is undergoing a minor medical procedure, his spokesperson said.\nThe protests in Bangladesh began in early July with demands from university students to abolish quotas in civil service jobs, but snowballed into a broader anti-government movement.\nIn all, more than 400 people are reported to have died in clashes between government forces and protesters - mostly civilians shot by police. \nOn Monday alone, more than 100 people died across the country, making it the single deadliest day in the movement. Hundreds of police stations were also torched. \nHours before protesters stormed and looted the former PM's official residence in the capital Dhaka, Ms Hasina resigned and fled to neighbouring India. That brought a swift and abrupt end to her nearly 15-year rule.\nEven as Bangladesh's economy grew in the past decade, the former PM came under increasing criticism for silencing her critics and jailing her political opponents. \nSome of them, such as ex-PM Khaleda Zia and activist Ahmad Bin Quasem, were released soon after Ms Hasina's hasty exit.\nMs Zia chairs the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which boycotted elections in 2014 and again in 2024, saying free and fair polls were not possible under Ms Hasina.\nThe 78-year-old was imprisoned in 2018 for corruption - charges, she said, were politically motivated.\nRights groups say Mr Quasem was detained in 2016,  one of hundreds of forced disappearances during Ms Hasina's tenure.\nProf Yunus, who was sentenced to six months in jail in January for violating labour laws, has said he too was a victim of Ms Hasina's ire.  \nHe has faced other allegations in the past, going back to 2011 when he was accused of defaming Bangladesh's politicians.  \nIn 1983, he started Grameen Bank, which offers micro, long-term loans to help poor people start small businesses - a concept that has since taken off around the world. \nHe was accused of tax evasion and serving at Grameen Bank beyond the mandatory retirement age, which led to him being sacked - but Prof Yunus maintained that these were baseless charges.\nHe, along with the bank, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for showing that \"even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development\".\nHe became known internationally as the \"banker to the poor\", but Ms Hasina called him a \"bloodsucker\" of the poor and accused his bank of charging exorbitant interest rates.\nIt was never clear what was the origin of the feud with Ms Hasina, but many believe it was his unsuccessful efforts to set up a political party. \nMs Hasina is still in India but it's unclear yet if that is her final destination. Analysts believe that is unlikely despite her having been a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \nIndia, which shares a 4,096-km (2,545-mile) border with Bangladesh, will be averse to alienating the new government in Dhaka. \nDelhi has deployed additional troops along the border, its foreign minister S Jaishankar said.\nForeign leaders called on Bangladesh to uphold democracy after Prof Yunus's appointment was announced.\n\"Any decisions that the interim government makes, they need to respect democratic principles... to uphold the rule of law [and] reflect the will of the people,\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.\nAustralian foreign minister Penny Wong asked all parties to refrain from violence and \"respect universal rights\".

It might just change your life\".\nThe ASA says it received two complaints that it wasn't clear from the advert that he had a commercial interest in the company.\nIn its ruling, it said that the advert could seem like an independent review and knowing he was an investor was key for customers to be able to make an informed decision about the product.\nOne of the two banned ads for meal supplement company Huel saw the podcaster in a similar situation, pictured drinking one of their products with a quote saying: \"This is Huel\u2019s best product\".\nIn the second advert, he was seen in a video saying: \"This is the best product that Huel have released\".\n\"We considered that many consumers would interpret the ads as featuring a testimonial from Steven Bartlett about one of Huel\u2019s products,\" the ASA said in its ruling.\n\"Because the ads omitted material information about Steven Bartlett\u2019s position as a director at Huel, we concluded they were likely to mislead.\"\nThe watchdog said the ads could not appear again in their current form and that both companies must make sure future adverts don't \"misleadingly omit\" information about commercial relationships. \nThe regulator also banned an ad for Huel in 2022 on a Diary Of A CEO podcast where the presenter said he'd \"become hooked on\" a caramel flavour iced coffee drink.\nHuel, Zoe and Bartlett have been approached for comment.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "A United Nations (UN) patrol vehicle with six Irish soldiers on board was caught up in an air attack in a village in south Lebanon on Saturday.\nEight troops, including six Irish and two Polish, were on an armed patrol when there was a drone or air attack on a village.\nT\u00e1naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said none of the soldiers were injured in the attack, but damage was caused to the vehicle in which they were travelling.\nSpeaking in Dublin on Sunday, Mr Martin said the incident is still under investigation.\nIn a statement, the Defence Forces said the attack happened at about 20:00 local time. \nIt explained the two-vehicle patrol in the IRISHPOLBATT area of operations in UNIFIL south Lebanon was \"caught in an explosive blast of unknown origin\".\n\"The Defence Forces can confirm all personnel are safe and accounted for,\" it said. \nThere were no casualties, and both vehicles and all personnel recovered to the Irish position of UNP 245.\"\nIt said that the124th Infantry Battalion will \"continue to conduct framework operations and remain the eyes and ears in South Lebanon for the international community\".\nProviding details of the incident, Mr Martin said: \"Essentially about eight soldiers, two armoured vehicles, six Irish and two Polish, they were on routine patrol and there was an attack, either drone or airstrike on the village that they were patrolling through.\n\"They had come out, it seems, from the other end of the village. And shrapnel or whatever appears to have pierced the vehicles.\"\nMr Martin said: \"We have ideas as to who would have made that particular attack but I would say at this stage, we will be making representations on foot of this, on the basis that both the IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) and Hezbollah must fulfil their obligations to peacekeepers.\"\nThere have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October.\nHezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group that is also backed by Iran. \nBoth groups are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries.\nThe T\u00e1naiste said there are \"thousands of peacekeepers in Lebanon to keep the peace\". \n\"It's the most noble, objective thing to do and we take the full protection of our soldiers very seriously,\" he said. \nMr Martin said he will receive further information later on Sunday about the incident. \n\"It is a serious incident and one I am very concerned about,\" he said. \n\"It illustrates the danger of a wider escalation of the war to Lebanon in terms of the danger to peacekeepers and the civil population in Lebanon,\" Mr Martin added. \n\"And it's matter of greatest concern.\"",

    "Hundreds of people lined the pavements of a Derby suburb for a peaceful protest in response to recent disorder.\nFears of further protests organised by people opposed to immigration had been sparked by the circulation of a list, claimed to be the addresses of lawyers who represent asylum seekers.\nCrowds gathered from early afternoon on Normanton Road, near an immigration centre and mosque.\nNo disturbances were reported and the police thanked the community for its cooperation. \nUmar Ali, who teaches evening classes at a local mosque, repeatedly addressed the crowd calling for responsible behaviour and how the vigil was for \"solidarity and unity\".\nHe said: \"We have made such a great effort, let's not spoil the moment.\n\"Let's show the Muslim ummah is still strong and we are still standing together peacefully.\"\nAsgar Tair, a boxing coach who also attended the vigil, said: \"I'm a proud Derby lad and I want to make sure we don't go over the line.\n\"There are people that are frustrated, there are people who want to express their feelings but we want the local businesses protected.\n\"Normanton is a great community and we stick together and if someone wants to engage in something horrible, we will rise above that.\"\nLocal plumber Amir Khan said: \"We are here to protect our community, our shops and keep law and order.\n\"We are not going to let racist thugs come down here and break our shops.\n\"We are working with the police and we are giving the police our full support as a community.\"\nPolice also thanked the community for their cooperation.\nCh Supt Emma Aldred said: \"I want to reassure communities that we are doing our very best in terms of looking at information and intelligence and I want to thank all those that have come forward and provided that information.\n\"There is no place in our county for racism, discrimination and the causing of fear which we are seeing amongst our communities.\"\nMore than 25 towns and cities have seen unrest since the killings of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, in Southport on 29 July.\nThis has been partly blamed on misinformation about the nationality and religion of the man arrested in connection with the attack.\nAround the country, thousands of police officers were on standby in preparation for potential unrest but the evening largely passed off peacefully.\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Calls to denounce \u201cdie hard\" Taiwanese secessionists, a tipline to report them and punishments that include the death penalty for \u201cringleaders\u201d \u2013  Beijing\u2019s familiar rhetoric against Taiwan is turning dangerously real.\nThe democratically-governed island has grown used to China\u2019s claims. Even the planes and ships that test its defences have become a routine provocation. But the recent moves to criminalise support for it are unnerving Taiwanese who live and work in China, and those back home.\n\u201cI am currently planning to speed up my departure,\u201d a Taiwanese businesswoman based in China said \u2013 this was soon after the Supreme Court ushered in changes allowing life imprisonment and even the death penalty for those guilty of advocating for Taiwanese independence.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that is making a mountain out of a molehill. The line is now very unclear,\u201d says Prof Chen Yu-Jie, a legal scholar at Taiwan\u2019s Academia Sinica.\nChina\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office was quick to assure the 23 million Taiwanese that this is not targeted at them, but at an \u201cextremely small number of hard-line independence activists\u201d. The \u201cvast majority of Taiwanese compatriots have nothing to fear,\u201d the office said.\nBut wary Taiwanese say they don\u2019t want to test that claim. The BBC has spoken to several Taiwanese who live and work in China who said they were either planning to leave soon or had already left. Few were willing to be interviewed on record; none wanted to be named.\n\u201cAny statement you make now could be misinterpreted and you could be reported. Even before this new law China was already encouraging people to report on others,\u201d the businesswoman said.\nThat was made official last week when Chinese authorities launched a website identifying Taiwanese public figures deemed \u201cdie hard\u201d separatists. The site included an email address where people could send \u201cclues and crimes\u201d about those who had been named, or anyone else they suspected.\nScholars believe Beijing hopes to emulate the success of Hong Kong\u2019s national security laws, which it said were necessary for stability - but they have crushed the city\u2019s pro-democracy movement as former lawmakers, activists and ordinary citizens critical of the government have been jailed under them.\nBy making pro-Taiwanese sentiments a matter of national security, Beijing hopes to \u201ccut off the movement\u2019s ties with the outside world and to divide society in Taiwan between those who support Taiwan independence and those who do not\u201d, Prof Chen says.\nShe believes the guidance from the Supreme Court will almost certainly result in prosecutions of some Taiwanese living in China.\n\u201cThis opinion has been sent to all levels of law enforcement nationwide. So this is a way of saying to them \u2013 we want to see more cases like this being prosecuted, so go and find one.\u201d\n\u201cWe must be even more cautious,\u201d said a Taiwanese man based in Macau. He said he had always been prepared for threats, but the new legal guidance had made his friends \u201cexpress concern\u201d about his future in the Chinese city.\n\u201cIn recent years, patriotic education has become prevalent in Macau, with more assertive statements on Taiwan creating a more tense atmosphere compared to pre-pandemic times,\u201d he added.\nTaiwan, which has powerful allies in the US, the EU and Japan, rejects Beijing\u2019s plans for \u201creunification\u201d \u2013 but fears have been growing that China\u2019s Xi Jinping has sped up the timeline to take the island, an avowed goal of the Chinese Communist Party.\nFor more than 30 years Taiwanese companies - iPhone-maker Foxconn, advanced chips giant TSMC and electronics behemoth Acer \u2013 have played a key role in China\u2019s growth. The prosperity also brought Taiwanese from across the strait who were in search of jobs and brighter prospects.\n\u201cI absolutely loved Shanghai when I first moved there. It felt so much bigger, more exciting, more cosmopolitan than Taipei,\u201d says Zoe Chu*. She spent more than a decade in Shanghai managing foreign musicians who were in high demand from clubs and venues in cities across China.\nThis was the mid-2000s when China was booming, drawing money and people from across the globe. Shanghai was at the heart of it - bigger, shinier and trendier than any other Chinese city.\n\u201cMy Shanghainese friends were dismissive of Beijing. They called it the big northern village,\u201d Ms Chu recalls. \u201cShanghai was the place to be. It had the best restaurants, the best nightclubs, the coolest people. I felt like such a country bumpkin, but I learned fast.\u201d\nBy the end of that decade \u2013 in 2009 - more than 400,000 Taiwanese lived in China. By 2022, that number had plummeted to 177,000, according to official figures from Taiwan.\n\u201cChina had changed,\u201d says Ms Chu, who left Shanghai in 2019. She now works for a medical company in Taipei and has no plans to return.\n\u201cI am Taiwanese,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer safe for us there.\u201d\nThe Taiwanese exodus has been driven by the same things that have pushed huge numbers of foreigners to leave China \u2013 a sluggish economy, growing host",
    "Who is Banksy?\nHe's one of the world's most famous artists, but despite his global following, his identity remains, officially at least, unknown.\nOften described as \"elusive\" and \"secretive\" by the press, the \"guerrilla street artist\" counts A-list celebrities, such as actor Brad Pitt, among his fans and collectors.\nA hero to some, a vandal to others, his artworks sell for eye-watering sums, with councils and landowners rushing to profit from - or whitewash - buildings chosen as his latest canvas.\nAnd yet, the self-styled prankster and anti-establishment figure has consistently managed to remain anonymous.\nSo what do we actually know about him?\nBanksy rose to prominence after he began spray-painting his now-trademark stencilled designs around Bristol in the early 1990s.\nThe city's influential music and arts scene - home of bands such as Massive Attack and Portishead - is said to have inspired his work.\nBanksy himself is believed to have been born in the nearby town of Yate, in South Gloucestershire, in the early 1970s.\nHis first large stencil mural - The Mild Mild West - which depicts a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police, was painted in the Stokes Croft area of Bristol in 1999.\nIn the early 2000s, he moved to London and continued to attract attention with his satirical street art.\nBy the mid 2000s, Banksy was becoming a celebrity himself - albeit an anonymous one. Simultaneously, his works became more ambitious, popping up in cities all over the world. \nThe appearance of a new Banksy soon started to become a media event. His mythical status as the masked artist poking fun at authority brought him - or at least his brand - international recognition.\nExhibitions of his work, in cities including Los Angeles and London, became sell-out events. His often politically-charged works began to sell for huge amounts of money, with customers including Pitt, Paul Smith and Christina Aguilera. \nIn 2009, his Banksy v Bristol Museum show drew enormous crowds. Sticking to his roots, in 2015, his Dismaland exhibition took over a derelict seafront lido in Weston-super-Mare.\nA 2010 documentary film Exit Through The Gift Shop - showing Banksy at work - was nominated for an Academy Award and a Bafta.\nAnd in 2018, in a highly theatrical piece of performance art, he staged a live destruction of his stencil Girl with Balloon at Sotheby's auction house - moments after it was sold for \u00a31m.\nA number of names have been linked with Banksy in the past: Robert Del Naja, Robin Gunningham, Art Attack's Neil Buchanan or a Bristol art collective.\nIn what it declared to be a world exclusive, The Mail on Sunday unveiled Banksy as Mr Gunningham, \"a former public schoolboy brought up in middle-class suburbia\".\nCompounding this theory, last year the BBC unearthed an interview in which the artist appears to confirm his first name as \"Robbie\".\nIn the 2003 recording, BBC reporter Nigel Wrench asks him if he is called \"Robert Banks\", and the artist replies: \"It's Robbie.\" The full interview can be heard on BBC Sounds as Radio 4's The Banksy Story.\nMr Gunningham has never commented on the speculation.\nA book of photos released by Banksy's former agent, Steve Lazarides, claims to show the artist at work, although none of the images showed his face. But it prompted yet more speculation - and intrepid photographers, both amateur and professional, trying to capture him on film.\nRobert Del Naja, of Bristol trip hop group Massive Attack, has also been linked to the artist. The vocalist, better known as 3D, has denied this, although he claimed to know the identity of the real Banksy, referring to him as a friend.\nCould that friend be Neil Buchanan, host of ITV show Art Attack? \nBuchanan was forced to deny any links to Banksy after a suggestion that he was the face behind the spray cans spread on social media.\nAnother possibility is that Banksy is actually not one person, but many - operating as an art collective.\nOf course, all of the above could be false trails, in the hope of throwing the wider media off the scent. \nBanksy's notoriously tight-lipped PR reps refuse to be drawn on his identity. And those in the know are keeping shtum.\nAs the artist - presumably - moves into middle age, his prolific creative output continues, if anything with works that are more outspoken and political than earlier pieces.\nThe war in Ukraine, where a Banksy appeared in November 2022, and immigration are just two of the issues recently embraced by the artist. \nWith fame have come imitators, and thefts. \nDisputed works are common - with only the genuine Banksy pieces legitimised on his Instagram account.\nIn December, two men were arrested in London on suspicion of theft and criminal damage after a Banksy artwork in south London - a red stop sign featuring three military drones - was removed.\nMost recently, he confirmed that he was behind a mural in north London featuring green spray paint made to look like the foliage of a heavily pruned tree in the fore",
    "The deputy mayor of West Yorkshire, Alison Lowe, knows only too well the pain of losing a loved one in a car crash. \nHer sister, Debbie, was fatally injured in a collision on Roundhay Road in Leeds in 1965 at the age of just three years old.\nMs Lowe has now launched what is called the Vison Zero initiative, with the aim of reducing to zero the number of people killed or seriously injured on West Yorkshire's roads by 2040.\nWith 1,450 casualties, including 50 deaths, on the county's roads in 2023, Ms Lowe said there was much work to do and she asked everyone to \"please play your part\".\nSpeaking of the loss of her sister, Ms Lowe said: \"I was a year old. I never got to know her, I never got to grow up with her. \n\"The impact on my family was devastating. My mum and dad never forgot her.\n\"My dad became a bus driver in later life. He won a safe driver award because he was always the safest and best driver he could ever be because he remembered what had happened to Debbie.\"\nWith that in mind, Ms Lowe said the new Vision Zero initiative for West Yorkshire would focus on the \"safe system\" approach.\nThat included making roads as safe as possible, educating drivers about their behaviour, post-collision response and speed awareness, she said.\nAt a launch event for Vision Zero outside Cartwright Hall in Lister Park, Bradford, on Tuesday, Bev and Steve Gough spoke of their own loss.\nThey said they were there to represent their daughter, Naomi, 19, who died in a crash in 2007.\nNaomi had just celebrated her birthday and had recently returned from a holiday in Blackpool.\nBut on her way home from work one evening, she died in a crash on the flyover in Halifax.\nMrs Gough said she knew cutting road deaths to zero in West Yorkshire would be \"an extremely tough challenge\".\n\"Although there are really decent responsible people behind the wheel of a car, you will always have the idiots,\" she said.\n\"But even if we don't eradicate it, we can massively reduce the fatalities and serious injuries.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Gough said it was \"all about education\".\n\"I would say think about your actions. You do not want to put your family, or somebody else's family, through what we're going through right now,\" he said.\n\"It is a life sentence. Never mind the courts, you will never stop living that moment and you will feel it for the rest of your life.\"\nMs Lowe agreed that education was key, adding: \"We need to address the root causes why people are killed and seriously injured on our roads.\"\nShe added: \"We can do it if we do it together, because this is about looking at road design, looking at car design, looking at behaviours, looking at how we as a society tolerate road deaths.\" \nMs Lowe said as part of the Vision Zero initiative, drivers would have a vital role to play in making it a success. \n\"You are part of a community, part of a family. You're part of a wider West Yorkshire,\" she said.\nThe Vision Zero website, run by West Yorkshire Combined Authority, includes safety advice, information on child car seat check events, and a portal where users can submit dashcam footage of dangerous driving to the police.\nMs Lowe said the message of Vision Zero was simple: \"Please play your part. Do not be selfish, do not speed, do not use drink or drugs when driving.\n\"Wear your seat belt, don't use your mobile phone, and always take care when you're driving.\"  \nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Two plain-clothed UK police officers were waiting for Dmitry Gudkov as he arrived at London\u2019s Luton Airport last summer. The Russian opposition politician, who lives in exile in an EU country, was flying to the UK to attend a friend\u2019s birthday.\n\u201cThey were there to intercept me immediately after I exited the plane,\u201d Dmitry says. \u201cThat had never happened to me before.\"\nBut the police weren\u2019t arresting him \u2013 instead, they wanted to warn him.\n\u201cThey told me I\u2019m on a list of people who are in danger. They asked where I\u2019ll be staying and what phone I\u2019ll be using.\u201d\nDmitry Gudkov is the co-founder of the Anti-War Committee, an organisation that co-ordinates efforts to oppose the war in Ukraine. He is wanted in Russia for \"spreading fakes\" about the Russian army.\nThe start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to a wide-ranging crackdown against opponents inside Russia. Almost all activists and independent journalists fled the country.\nNow, a number of Kremlin critics living in Europe have told the BBC that Russia is stepping up its efforts to silence, threaten and persecute opponents abroad. Some were unwilling to share their stories publicly. The Russian embassy in London didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nAnalyst Mark Galeotti, who studies the Russian security services, agrees that the campaign against Russia\u2019s \"enemies\" abroad is intensifying. \u201cI think it reflects the growing paranoia of the Kremlin,\u201d he says, \u201cthat it is involved in an existential political struggle.\"\nWith all dissent snuffed out at home, Russia is turning its attention to opponents who have sought refuge in the West. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, described them as \u201ctraitors who have gone over to the enemy and want their Fatherland to perish\u201d.\nAnother anti-Kremlin activist was also contacted by British police. \u201cThey said they needed to discuss the safety of me and my family,\u201d Ksenia Maximova tells me. \nThe founder of the Russian Democratic Society in London says the police advised her not to travel to certain countries where Russian agents operate more freely. \n\u201c[The Kremlin is] stepping up the campaign against \u2018enemies\u2019, that\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d she says, \u201cThey\u2019re tightening the screws.\u201d \nShe and her fellow campaigners have noticed an uptick in cyber attacks and attempts to infiltrate the group online.\nIn a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for UK Counter Terrorism Policing said, \u201cWe have been open for some time now about the growing demand within our casework relating to countering state threats\u2026 We have been actively increasing resources dedicated to countering the activity of hostile states.\u201d \nIn December, new UK legislation came into effect, giving police more powers to tackle threats from hostile states such as Russia.\n\"Parasites can\u2019t sleep in peace...\" was one of the messages that investigative journalist Alesya Marokhovskaya received last year. \nThe threats were accompanied by the name of the street in Prague where she lived. \u201cI moved house to make it harder for them,\u201d says Alesya. \n\u201cWe thought it may just be some crazy Czech guy who was pro-Putin and had recognised me on the street.\u201d\nBut then the messages became more sinister - calling her a \"scumbag\" and promising to find her \"wherever she walks her wheezing dog\". \nAlesya\u2019s dog really does wheeze when it walks. She informed the Czech police.\nLater, Alesya was due to fly to Sweden to attend a conference. The sender then sent even more specific threats: details of her flight, seat number and the hotel she had booked. \u201cIt was clear they had high-level access to documents,\u201d Alesya says. \u201cIt looks like the behaviour of the Russian state.\u201d\nAlesya had been branded a 'foreign agent\u2019 years before by the Russian government, due to her work at independent Russian news website iStories.\n\u201cWhen I left Russia and came to Prague, I had this illusion of security,\u201d says Alesya. \u201cNow I realise that [Russian intelligence services] can get their hands on people almost anywhere in Europe. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not afraid, because I am.\"\nBut why is this happening now? Experts suggest the Russian security services are beginning to activate operations abroad after a period of turmoil. Hundreds of Russian diplomats believed to be intelligence agents operating under diplomatic cover were expelled from Western countries following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\u201cThere was a period of confusion after 2022,\u201d says Andrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist who writes about the intelligence services. \u201cIn 2023, the agencies regrouped and found a new sense of purpose. They got resources and began increasing pressure.\u201d\nMark Galeotti says the authorities are increasingly turning to proxies to do their dirty work - criminal gangs: \u201cIf you want someone beaten up or even killed, they\u2019re a lot easier to engage,\u201d says Mr Galeotti, who has been writing about the links between the Russian state and organised crime for years. \n\u201cThey\u2019re going t",
    "Very high levels of pollution have been recorded at a site where hundreds of people are due to take part in an annual 10km (6.2 miles) swim.\nIn one test by the Environment Agency (EA) at Steamer Quay at Totnes, Devon, E. coli pollution was more than 20 times minimum standards and water quality was poor in nine out of the first 10 tests this year.\nSteamer Quay, where the Dart 10K swim is due to be held on 7 and 8 September, is one of 27 new designated bathing sites in England, including five in Devon.\nDart 10K organisers Level Water said the event had \"never had an outbreak of illness\" and South West Water (SWW) said improvements were planned at all storm water overflows affecting Steamer Quay.\nDesignated bathing site status means the site is an officially recognised swimming spot and gets weekly tests by the EA from May to September.\nThe agency tests for faecal matter, which can come from many sources, including sewage from storm water overflows, livestock, wildlife, birds and road drainage.\nResults are graded excellent, good, sufficient - where results met minimum standards - and poor.\nResults at Steamer Quay showed poor levels of faecal indicator, the bacteria E. coli, on nine out of the first 10 readings since May.\nIn one test on 6 July, levels hit more than 20 times minimum standards.\nThe more E. coli in bathing water, the \"greater risks to bathers' health\", says the Environment Agency.\nThe UK Health Security Agency said some types of E. coli could cause severe illness and it had produced guidance for open water swimmers.\nThe Outdoor Swimming Society, which also gives advice on designated bathing waters, said if one was classified as poor \"this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t swim\" but \"there might be an increased risk of getting ill\".\n\"I swim every day and this isn't a location I would choose to swim,\" said Hannah Pearson, director and founder of Friends of the Dart, which campaigned for designation.\n\"But many do, as well as canoeists and paddleboarders, which is why it was important to designate this site.\"\nThe friends \"frequently\" had reports of illness, some serious, from swimming in the Dart, she said.\n\"If people are informed in an accurate way, we can make decisions collaboratively to resolve these problems,\" she added.\nFurther down the swim route at Stoke Gabriel, pollution levels were poor twice in the first 10 tests.\nAt Dittisham, where the event ends, there were no poor results.\nTests have also been taking place further down the river at Warfleet, near Dartmouth, where pollution levels were poor once over the same period.\nPollution levels were poor twice at Coastguards Beach on the River Erme.\nAbout 1,600 swimmers are expected in the Dart 10K which had \"never had an outbreak of illness\" since the charity event started in 2010, said Level Water.\n\"Water quality and personal tolerance to impurities both vary, and the decision to swim on any given day is a personal responsibility,\" it said.  \n\"The test results are disappointing and we hope to see improvement quickly. \n\"Amongst other measures, we recommend that swimmers cover cuts before the swim and wash their hands with soap after the swim.\"\nBruce Newport, area environment manager of the Environment Agency, said the river was in \"relatively good shape\" as a whole.\nHe said the data produced by the new testing would better inform SWW and farmers about problem areas.\n\"Then we will be able to make sure the investment we asked for is being put in the right place,\" he said.\n\"After heavy rain, there is a risk of elevated levels. So we say, after heavy rain, choose a beach where you don't have the influence of a river,\" he said.\nCanoeist Kerri Adams said she had heard in the previous weeks about the water quality tests at Steamer Quay.\n\"It's nice to see because, hopefully, there will be big changes,\" she said.\n\"Water pollution is a massive issue and we want to see some action.\"\nSWW said it would be investigating factors affecting water quality \"to see what further investment may be required\".\n\"There are a wide range of factors which can affect river water quality, including agricultural and urban pollution,\" said a spokesperson.\n\"We recognise that to improve the quality of our rivers, we all need to play our part.\n\"We are serious about tackling storm overflows and change of this scale takes time, ambition and increased investment, and that is why we are investing \u00a3850m in our region over two years.\"\nIt added: \"Following its designation, we have improvements planned at all of the storm overflows which have the potential to impact bathing water quality at Steamer Quay.\"\nSWW produces live a map showing beaches which may be affected by storm water overflows as well as another map showing which overflows are active.\nAn overall grading, from excellent through to poor, for all bathing sites is expected to be published in November by Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra).\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

They also posted undercover advertisements soliciting sex to catch and arrest sex buyers.\nIn total, 14 sex buyers were arrested. Nine adult potential victims of sex trafficking were recovered and offered social services, as well as one 16-year-old.\nThe operation was lauded by several local and law enforcement agencies.

    "\nThe FBI has opened an investigation into allegations from the Trump campaign that it was targeted by hackers working for the Iranian government.\n\u201cWe can confirm the FBI is investigating the matter,\u201d the agency said in a short statement on Monday without specifically naming the former president or Iran.\nA Trump campaign spokesman told the BBC the documents were illegally obtained by \"foreign sources hostile to the United States\".\nIranian officials have denied any connection to the hack and the US government has not formally accused Iran.\nThe FBI is also looking into whether Iranian hackers targeted the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris campaign, according to CBS News, the BBC's news partner, citing people familiar with the investigation.\nThe Trump campaign statement came one day after Microsoft released a report indicating that Iranian hackers targeted the campaign of an unnamed US presidential candidate in June.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) said that the campaign was sent a spear- phishing email \u2013 a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link.\nOn Saturday, Trump said the hackers were \"only able to get publicly available information\".\nThe FBI began the investigations in early summer after both campaigns experienced attempted phishing schemes, CBS News reported.\nAccording to the Washington Post, three staff members of the Biden-Harris campaign were also targeted by phishing emails in the days before President Joe Biden announced that he was quitting the race. \nA Harris campaign spokesperson said in a statement to the media that the campaign \"vigilantly monitors and protects against cyberthreats, and we are not aware of any security breaches of our systems\".\nThe BBC has asked the Harris campaign for comment.\nAccording to the Washington Post, the FBI probe into the hacking attempts was first opened in June. \nDemocratic Congressman Adam Schiff was among several lawmakers calling for the FBI to reveal what it knows about the hacking attempts. \nHe said that the US intelligence community \u201cmoved much too slow to properly identity the hacking and dumping scheme carried out by Russia\u201d in 2016 and \u201cshould act quickly here\u201d.\nIt comes after Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell said he was requesting a briefing from the Department of Homeland Security on the \"alleged hack of Trump's presidential campaign\". \n\"Yes, Trump is the most despicable person ever to seek office. He also sought foreign hacking in a past election... But that doesn\u2019t mean America ever tolerates foreign interference,\" he posted on X/Twitter on Saturday.\nAt campaign rallies in 2016, he asked Russia to hack his opponent in the race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nUS security sources had previously warned of an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump, unconnected to last month\u2019s attempted shooting in Pennsylvania. \nAnd on Tuesday, the US justice department charged a Pakistani man alleged to have ties to Iran with plotting to assassinate US officials, potentially including the former president.",
    "The Prince and Princess of Wales sent a congratulatory video message at the end of the Olympics - but that wasn't all that people noticed.\nFor once, it also wasn't the wellbeing of Catherine that was under scrutiny.\nInstead, it was Prince William's holiday beard.\nRoyal fans immediately began asking: was this going to be a permanent feature? Or was the beard an outbreak of summer bohemianism that hits middle-aged men on their holidays?\nYou know what it's like - they start thinking it\u2019s Glasto in the 1990s.\nIt begins with the socks disappearing, then moves onto that creative T-shirt, or the collarless linen shirt, and then the shades that looked cool in the reflection of the third bottle of wine.\nBut if this proves more than a fleeting moment of royal stubble, it wouldn't be the first royal beard.\nIt might now be a case of God Shave the King, but when Charles was a young man in the navy in the 1970s he sported an impressive beard. It was a kind of gamekeeper chic.\nAlthough all Windsors with beards run the risk of looking like Russian tsars.\nPrince William's brother Harry has also been a prominent beard-wearer. Although whatever you say, don't mix up hair with heir.\nThe issue of beards came up in Prince Harry's book Spare.\n\"To beard or not to beard, that was the question,\" wrote Harry, as he remembered how his grandfather Prince Philip wanted more beard rather than less.\n\"Let grow the luxurious bristles of a bloody Viking!\" he wrote.\nThe beard was also a source of contention between the brothers, according to Prince Harry's book, with Harry wanting to have a beard at his wedding to Meghan, while he claimed Prince William thought he shouldn't.\nPerhaps what is most intriguing, though, is how Harry's beard took on a symbolic importance for him, as something that put a check on his anxiety and helped him \"quell my nerves\".\n\"I couldn't explain it, though I did find articles describing the phenomenon. Maybe it was Freudian - beard as security blanket. Maybe it was Jungian - beard as mask. Whatever, it made me calmer...\" wrote Prince Harry.\nWhether or not Prince William has taken criticism of his beard on the chin, it seems to have gone down well with his royal fans.\nThe New York Post's Page Six, the paper of record for such moments, summed it up as \"Wowza.\"\nHowever, there was a more cautious approach from the Beard Liberation Front, a group that campaigns in support of beards.\nSpokesman and prominent letter writer Keith Flett says the group is \"continuing to review Prince William's latest beard and assessing if it is contributing to a positive image of the hirsute in the public eye\".\nI suppose they are razor-sharp critics in such an organisation.\nBut the royal beard proved to be the talking point at the end of the Olympics, even overshadowing the appearance of Tom Cruise, who was seen travelling by motorbike, plane and parachute.\nPrince William has already been something of a royal style pioneer, pushing ahead with the tie-less monarchy.\nThere's often a casual, relaxed style on his visits, which is useful for putting people at ease.\nIt's the dad at the school barbecue look. Although - apologies in advance - he'll now be avoiding the barber queue.\nWilliam represents a millennial version of the monarchy and on visits he has the style of a generation that's used to working from home. Or palace in his case.\nIt's the depths of summer now though. So there's no need to bristle and plenty of ways of keeping up to scratch.",

    "For many years, Dovedale's stepping stones have provided the perfect platform for walkers to access hikes up the valley across the River Dove in the Peak District.\nFirst laid in about 1890 for Victorian tourists, people can walk between Derbyshire and Staffordshire by crossing the stones.\nBut in recent times, the beauty spot has been plagued by bad weather and safety issues, and last year the stones were officially closed after they were badly damaged when Storm Babet hit in October.\nA bridge a few hundred metres downstream provides a safe route across the river, but crowds continue to cross the stones, which were thrown into the spotlight after police launched an investigation into a confrontation between two groups of people late last month.\nSo what is it about this closed landmark that attracts people from far and wide?\nMobile phone footage captured on 27 July showed sticks being waved and punches thrown at the stepping stones.\nDerbyshire Police confirmed it had reports of a fight at 14:30 BST, including claims from a caller that a child in his party had been hit, and that an attempt was made to steal his wife's purse.\nNo arrests have yet been made, the force told the BBC.\nThe National Trust, which owns the land, said it understood that \"disturbances of this kind can be upsetting for visitors\".\nA spokesperson added: \"We'd also like to remind visitors that the stepping stones are currently closed because of storm damage and signs are in place asking visitors not to use them.\"\nThe stones were acquired by the National Trust in 1934, and Dovedale was declared a National Nature Reserve in 2006 in a bid to further protect it.\nFour years later, renovation work saw limestone blocks cemented on top of the slabs, which sparked accusations that it had spoiled the stones' natural beauty.\nThe famous stones, which have featured on postcards of the Peak District, were also dislodged in July 2012 and in December 2016.\nAnd last year, the trust said two stones had been \"toppled over\" by debris, which was washed down the river.\nDerbyshire County Council, which is responsible for the repairs, said it had permission from Natural England to work at the spot - because it is a site of special scientific interest.\nOn Wednesday, the authority announced repairs would begin on Monday, and would be complete by 23 August.\nIn addition to the crowds seen during the confrontation, a simple search on Facebook or TikTok returns a variety of recently posted pictures and video showing groups of people crossing the stones.\nDovedale and its river were immortalised by Izaak Walton in his famous 17th Century fishing book, The Compleat Angler.\nStaff from a hotel nearby that bears the writer's name - the Izaak Walton Country House Hotel - described the spot as \"stunning\".\nBut deputy manager Chris Rushton said: \"They [the crowds] queue from both sides to try to cross from both ways.\"\nOn the issue of overcrowding, a National Trust spokesperson said it was about balancing the provision of access \"with the needs of the environment and local communities\".\n\"The stepping stones are a public right of way leading out into the open countryside of the Peak District,\" they said.\n\"Since the stepping stones were damaged during Storm Babet, we have tried to keep as much of the area open to visitors as possible, with signage in place to advise visitors not to use them and we have suggested alternative routes.\"\nBy Matthew Barlow, BBC News\nI joined BBC Radio Derby in 2006 and have been to Dovedale on many different stories over the years, but I have never seen it as busy as it was late last month.\nUsually, when walking to the stepping stones on the path along the river from the car park, I would pass the occasional hiker and say \"hello\".\nBut this time it was like walking into a high street shop during the opening hours of a Boxing Day sale.\nThe people going there are of all ages and most of them don't stray far from the stepping stones.\nThere was litter on the ground in this area and through the clear water, you could see plastic bottles and food wrappers on the river bed.\nAnd industrial-sized bins in the main car park were overflowing after that weekend.\nLarge crowds often mean large amounts of litter - which has been sighted across the area.\nVisitors to the beauty spot said that while they saw litter-pickers, there was still \"plenty\" of rubbish.\nAmy Faulkner and Mitchell Lamarca, from Leicester, arrived to the area early in the day and said it was a \"bit of a shock\" to see so much litter.\nMs Faulkner said she had seen discarded banana skins and nappy bags at the site.\n\"I've put all my rubbish in my bag because I haven't seen a single bin,\" she added.\nSimilarly, Rachel Scully, from Windsor, said: \"I have noticed plastic bottles in the river here but also I would say I haven't seen any bins either.\n\"I've had to take my dog waste up the top of Thorpe Cloud and bring it back down, but I will take it with me.\"\nDarren Walker, from Stoke-on-Trent, described the rubbish",
    "A Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) has launched a judicial review against the Home Office over the way it calculates how much money is allocated to police forces.\nLincolnshire PCC Marc Jones has repeatedly claimed the force is one of the worst funded in the country per resident, saying the current formula relies on \"outdated\" population statistics and metrics.\nDuring a regional police and crime panel meeting on Friday, he said: \u201cThe papers are lodged with the courts and the Home Office has until 12 August to respond to the paperwork that I\u2019ve submitted.\"\nThe Home Office declined to comment citing ongoing legal proceedings.\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Mr Jones said: \u201cThere are a number of outcomes that are possible from that, but I would hope that the whole process leads to the kind of debate we need to get the national funding formula reviewed.\u201d\nHe also highlighted the academic work being undertaken to examine how the force spends money and to ensure it was not \"missing any tricks\" when trying to save funds.\n\u201cThe reality is, over the next few years, the gap is just too big,\" said Mr Jones, who was recently re-elected for his third term. \n\"If nothing changes, it will lead to a radical shift in the way policing is delivered in Lincolnshire.\u201d\n\u201cThis is nothing new,\u201d he added. \n\u201cWhen I started back in 2016, Chief Constable Neil Rhodes was saying the same thing, so we\u2019ve made some progress.\u201d\nMr Jones estimated the force needed an additional \u00a320m a year over the medium term to be sustainable, describing it as an \u201cimpossible hill to climb without massive changes to the way we do business\".\nHe said he and the current chief constable, Paul Gibson, had requested meetings with ministers to further discuss the issue.\nThe Home Office previously said Lincolnshire's police funding would be \"up to \u00a3164.3m in 2024-25\" - an increase of up to \u00a39.2 million on the year before.\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

It got the ball catapulted into the stratosphere.\"\nBut he's left the backing singers skit at home, preferring to offer audiences something different. \n\"It's so nice to meet people in real life,\" he says, comparing performing on stage to performing online.\n\"To get that in-person, live feedback.\"\nAbi Clarke's journey has been the opposite way round to Chris and Courtney, starting her career in stand-up offline and then moving on to social media.\n\"I didn't want to be a social media person,\" she says, but adds: \"You have to be now.\"\nAbi now has almost a million followers on TikTok and more than 27 million likes.\nSince becoming popular online, she still has to figure out how to translate her online comedy to a real life audience.\n\"It's scary. I feel like I'm introducing my school friends to my work friends.\n\"They're different forms of performance and they're different vibes,\" she says. \"But it's still me.\"\nWith so many opportunities to go viral, Abi feels using social media to launch a more sustainable live career is a \"natural progression\" for comedians.\n\"I think people just want the live genre to be respected and people not to think that they can just come and do a show on the cuff,\" she says.\nFor those thinking of making the leap, she says there are some key differences to overcome when adapting your work.\nOn social media, \"you can be much more niche\", Abi says, and chances are people with similar interests will find you.\nBut at somewhere like the Fringe, \"you don't know who's going to come through that door... you have to make sure it's funny for - hopefully - anyone\".\n\"You also have to keep their attention for an hour,\" she adds, compared to short skits online.\nIt's harder \"but so much more fun\".\n\"Social media gets lonely... it can get you down.\n\"Nothing compares to people laughing live and people being in a room.\n\"A laugh emoji is never gonna match up to that.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "The scrapping of universal winter fuel payments for pensioners by the UK Labour government \"risks pushing some pensioners into fuel poverty,\" a Welsh Labour minister has warned.\nJane Hutt's comments came in response to a question from the Welsh Conservatives' leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies.\nLast month Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that, from this autumn, pensioners not on pension credit or other means-tested benefits would no longer get the annual payments.\nMr Davies called the policy \"unforgivable\" but a UK government spokesperson said it had inherited public finances in a \"dire state\" and \"must take difficult decisions\".\nWinter fuel payments were created in 1997 to help everyone above state pension age with their winter heating bills.\nAround 10 million pensioners in Wales and England are due to lose their winter fuel payments - worth between \u00a3100 and \u00a3300 - as a result of Ms Reeves' announcement.\nIn a written question to Social Justice Secretary Jane Hutt, Mr Davies asked what consideration had been given to the impact of the decision.\nIn her response Ms Hutt said: \"The decision that the winter fuel payment will no longer be universal risks pushing some pensioners into fuel poverty.\"\n\"This is why I am keen to work closely with the new UK government on our shared ambition of tackling poverty to develop a permanent, effective form of protection for households in need,\" she added.\nMs Reeves' announcement last month prompted criticism from opposition parties and following Ms Hutt's comments, Mr Davies said the move to scrap the universal element of the payment was \"unforgivable\".\n\"The move is a conscious decision by Labour to allow pensioners to be pushed into fuel poverty, and that decision should be reversed,\" he added.\nThe Older People's Commissioner for Wales, Helena Herklots has also described it as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and has urged the chancellor to reconsider.\nShe said: \"It is estimated that around 80,000 households in Wales miss out on Pension Credit despite being eligible, meaning older people are already missing out on over \u00a3200m they are entitled to.\n\"The chancellor\u2019s decision would mean that these households could now also miss out on tens of millions of pounds more that could make a big difference in terms of people\u2019s finances.\"\nA UK government spokesperson said ministers are \"committed to pensioners\" and \"protecting the triple lock, keeping energy bills low through our Warm Homes Plan, and cutting NHS waiting lists\".\nThe spokesperson said the government had inherited public finances in a \"dire state\" and \"must take difficult decisions to fix the foundations of the economy\".\n\u201cIn these circumstances it is right that winter fuel payment are targeted at those in most need, and we will work with local authorities to boost the uptake of pension credit, reaching the many pensioners who could still benefit from this year\u2019s winter fuel payments.\u201d\nOn a two-day visit to Wales earlier this week the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, met the new First Minister Eluned Morgan.\nBoth leaders spoke about how having the same party in power in Westminster and Cardiff would lead to a better working relationship, compared to how things were when the Conservatives were in government in London.\nWith that in mind, the UK government will likely find Ms Hutt's assessment unhelpful, as it continues to face wide-spread criticism of its decision to cut winter fuel payments.\nThe Welsh government, however, may argue it shows that ministers in Cardiff remain independent of their colleagues in Westminster.",

    "An owner of a vape shop on what was recently named Britain's best high street has called it \"unworthy\" of the title after he had \u00a325,000 of stock stolen. \nGeraint, 33, said there had been four attempted break-ins at his shop Queen Street Vapes in Cardiff. \nQueen Street took top prize in a consumer survey earlier this week run by GlobalData for American Express. \nSouth Wales Police said it would continue to work to make Cardiff a \"vibrant, safe and friendly\" place. \nGeraint, from Blackwood in Caerphilly county, owns shops in Swindon, Cwmbran, Abergavenny as well as his hometown, said he mainly worked in Cardiff because of the trouble he had dealt with. \nHe said: \"It gets to the point where I have considered selling up and cutting my losses.\n\"I struggle sleeping because of it, no CCTV or alarm system prevents them from getting in.\"\nGeraint posted a video on social media appearing to show three people taking vapes from his shop. \nSouth Wales Police said a 37-year-old man had pleaded guilty to burglary and the other two suspects had not been identified. \nCloser to the centre of the street, staff at Savers said theft and threats from shoplifters were a daily occurrence. \nEthan James Barnes, 20, who has worked at the Queen Street store for two years, said: \"Just this morning someone came in and stole \u00a3118 worth of baby's milk. You often get people stealing milk and laundry pods.\" \nHe said police could not properly enforce the law due to the thefts being of low-value items.\n\"The only time the police have been involved is when I was slapped in the face,\" he said. \nSouth Wales Police said it dealt with \"all shoplifters regardless of value\" but outcomes may vary depending on circumstances. \nRhys Thomas, 25, has worked at Holland and Barrett on Queen Street for more than a year, and said staff had started wearing body cameras in that time.\n\"The main downside of the job is the violence,\" he said. \n\"It's a continuous cycle with the same reoffenders, they get violent and the police get involved but it doesn't deter them, they keep coming back.\" \nSouth Wales Police said: \"It's real positive that Queen Street was recently named best high street in the UK, however we are sorry to hear the experiences of these city centre workers.\n\"Cardiff city centre remains a safe place but with an estimated half a million people passing through Queen Street and St Mary Street each week, unfortunately there will be incidents of crime and anti-social behaviour.\" ",
    "A \u00a325m scheme aimed at reducing congestion and improving air quality in a town is finally being given the green light.\nThe A40 Access to Witney project involves building new slip roads at the A40's junction with Shores Green - allowing traffic from the east to access the westbound A40 without going via the town centre.\nIt has been in the planning for nearly 15 years but construction contracts are expected to be approved by Oxfordshire County Council later.\nIt is hoped work could then begin later this year, to be completed in late 2025.\nThe council said the changes would give Witney residents in the east more choices when accessing services and employment in the west.\nAnother aim is to also improve connectivity for cyclists and pedestrians throughout the area, including South Leigh.\nCogges resident Owen Edwards, who has been campaigning for the scheme since 2009, said \"a year's worth of pain\" was now \"very short-term\".\nHe added the cost would be \"money well spent\" because of the benefits it would bring.\nConservative councillor Liam Walker said the connection would \"make significant improvements to the town centre and help reduce congestion and pollution\" but called the cost of the scheme \"staggering\".\nLabour councillor Duncan Enright, who has been campaigning for the improvements since 2010, said \"an unbelievable amount of bureaucracy\" had gone into it so far.\nHe added that it had been \"nice\" to see the amount of restaurants, pubs and caf\u00e9s in Witney that were putting tables and chairs outside.\n\"We're subsidising pavement licenses so that it's free but if you could reduce the amount of traffic, it becomes much more pleasant,\" he said.\nMr Enright admitted that in its early stages, the scheme had been estimated at only a fraction of its current cost but elements such as materials had become more expensive with time.\nHe said: \"We're getting a great infrastructure but it cost more than anybody could believe so we are constantly looking for ways to get good value for money.\"\nFunding for the project will come via a combination of the Oxfordshire Housing and Growth Deal and contributions from developers.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "Plans to end free parking and charge people based on their car's pollution levels have been dubbed a \u201ctax on the poor\u201d by a councillor.\nMidsomer Norton\u2019s South Road car park and the Church Street and Waterloo Road car parks in Radstock were all currently free places to park near the town centres. \nNow Bath and North East Somerset Council is consulting on plans to start charging people to park there, on the same basis as the \u201cemissions based charges\u201d people pay in Bath\u2019s car parks.\nIndependent councillor Shaun Hughes said: \u201cEmissions based charges are a tax on the poor, people who can\u2019t afford the latest electric vehicle or the latest fuel efficient vehicles.\u201d\nUnder the plans, parking at the car parks would be free for the first half hour. \nTwo hours parking would cost 80p for electric vehicles and the least polluting non-diesel cars, but diesel cars and cars producing higher carbon emissions will be charged extra \u2014 with two hours\u2019 parking costing the most polluting diesel cars 50p more. \nThe charges would apply from 08:00 to 18:00 BST Monday to Saturday.\nPay and display machines look up a vehicle\u2019s emissions from the DVLA and charge based on how much carbon is emitted or, if this information is not available, the capacity of the engine. \nThe proposed charges would come into force in October and go up again in after a year.\nEmissions based parking was first introduced in car parks in Bath in September 2023, intending to tackle air quality issues in the city. \nSpeaking at a full meeting of Bath and North East Somerset Council on 18 July, Mr Hughes said: \u201cThis scheme will move traffic out to out of town shopping that has free parking and increase vehicle movements. \n\"Displacement of vehicles and lack of footfall will have a devastating impact on our businesses - particularly those small independents that rely on single item purchases and visits - and will inevitably end up in some closures of some of these small businesses.\"\nEnding free parking in the Midsomer Norton and Radstock car parks is part of a wider set of updates to parking charges through which the council hopes to make \u00a3195,000 a year.\nThe council\u2019s cabinet member for transport Manda Rigby said: \u201cOur aim is to improve air quality, reduce congestion and encourage other ways to travel across Bath and North East Somerset and these proposals would be another step in the right direction to achieve this.\"\nThe consultation on the plans runs until 8 August. \nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "A man is touring 92 football grounds in his best friend's memory.\nStephen Roome, 44, from Bramcote in Nottinghamshire, is raising money for two mental health charities, one in the UK and one in Australia, where his friend Andrew Janson-Boot lived. \nMr Janson-Boot, who was a Nottingham Forest fan, died in March, aged 44, just a few weeks after Mr Roome had learned he was struggling with his mental health. \nThe pair grew up together, becoming best friends at school, and years later, Mr Janson-Boot was the best man at Mr Roome's wedding. \n\"He was my best friend throughout school - we messed about a lot and always had a lark.\n\"He enjoyed having a laugh, and he enjoyed life,\" Mr Roome said. \nMr Janson-Boot eventually moved to Australia with his family in 2006, but the pair stayed in touch via social media and through a group chat they shared with others. \nIt was about a month before Mr Janson-Boot died that Mr Roome said he had become aware of his friend's mental health issues, he said.  \n\"He sent us this message, and he said he had been having some mental health issues, but in the same message, he said he felt 100 times better. \n\"That came as a complete shock to us. Then about three weeks later I got a call from his sister in tears, saying he'd taken his life. \n\"I didn't know what to say, what to do, how to feel,\" Mr Roome said. \n\"I don't think it's something I'm ever going to quite come to terms with.

The number of shares they will have in the club will remain the same as now.\nHowever, because new shares are being created, their existing shares will drop from being worth 40% of the company to being worth 10%.\nThe new shares will replace loans totalling \u00a359m that have been made to the club by Norfolk Holdings Group, and that debt will be wiped out.\nThis is where football governance meets the world of business and finance.\nMr Attanasio and the other members of Norfolk Holdings Group have already been approved by the Football League\u2019s fit-and-proper-persons test, which everyone who wants to become an owner or a director of a league club has to satisfy. That protracted process was completed earlier this year and does not need to be revisited.\nHowever, because Norwich City FC is a PLC, the plan must go before The Takeover Panel. This would happen for any PLC that wanted to change its ownership model, whether it was a football club or not.\nIn simple terms, the panel's aim is to protect the interests of a company\u2019s minor shareholders to ensure they are being treated fairly. Norwich City is hopeful this process will be completed by the end of September. It will also be necessary for the independent shareholders to approve the plan at an extraordinary general meeting.\nIf all goes smoothly, Ms Smith and Mr Wynn Jones will step down from the board by the end of September. The share issue would be completed by March 2025.\nTwenty-seven years is a long time in any business, and particularly in football.\nBack in the mid-1990s, the Canaries were in a perilous state financially and on the brink of administration. Ms Smith and Mr Wynn Jones, along with other directors at the time, were credited with turning the business round.\nThe two-and-a-half decades since then have been a rollercoaster of six promotions, six relegations and 15 head coaches (or managers), of which Johannes Hoff Thorup is the latest.\nMany supporters have expressed gratitude that the pair have been fiercely protective of the club where they were previously season-ticket holders. They have often spoken out against the eyewatering amounts of money in modern football and the risks that some clubs take as they chase Premier League football.\nOther fans have been frustrated by that approach in recent years as Norwich have managed to win promotion to the Premier League on several occasions but then struggled to compete without someone to plough in vast sums of cash.\nEach triumphant Premier League promotion has been followed by relegation \u2013 sometimes in meek fashion.\nWhat is beyond doubt is that Norwich are waving goodbye to owners who have a passion for the club and genuinely believe they have always acted in the best interests of its long-term sustainability.\nMr Attanasio has had to prove that he has the right approach and ethics to take the club on, and has been working alongside Ms Smith and Mr Wynn Jones for the past couple of years.\nBrazilian midfielder Gabriel Sara became the latest high-profile departure from Carrow Road when he was sold to Galatasaray this month for more than \u00a320m. Norwich supporters would dearly love transfers like that to become a thing of the past.\nBut that feels somewhat unrealistic. Most clubs end up selling their best players at some point because there is usually a bigger club with more money to throw at them. They also have agents and advisors who stand to profit from moving talent around.\nThe Milwaukee Brewers approach suggests that the Canaries will take pride in developing talent and at least getting into a position where they can maximise the value of any player that does leave the club.\nMr Attanasio played in active role an recruiting Ben Knapper as sporting director last year. Finding talented players before bigger clubs do, giving them a chance to shine and then selling them on for a profit to ",
    "A charity which provides treatment for injured police officers said it had been \"inundated\" with applications for help following recent riots. \nThe Police Treatment Centre, based in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, offers mental and physical support to up to 4,000 officers each year. \nIts CEO Patrick Cairns said \"disgraceful scenes\" across the country had inflicted not only physical injuries but also \"mental scars\" on the police. \nThe facility works to rehabilitate those affected and get them back on the frontline.\nLast Sunday, more than 50 officers suffered broken bones, concussion and head wounds during violent disorder outside the Holiday Inn Express near Rotherham.\n\"This was truly awful, disgraceful scenes, which I condemn in the strongest of terms,\" said Mr Cairns.\n\"The people who are standing between us and chaos and meltdown are police officers.\n\"We\u2019ve certainly been inundated with applications from police officers within the last week asking for more support and treatment.\"\nAlthough he acknowledged the day-to-day nature of policing came with a lot of stress, Mr Cairns added the riots had been \"piled on top of that\".\n\"As well as physical injuries, there are mental scars which will be around for some time,\" he said.\n\"I think part of it is having to deal with this level of criminal disorder within their own communities, working in streets that they are familiar with.\"\nAt the treatment centre, police officers were offered physiotherapy for physical injuries and a psychological wellbeing programme, which included a residential stay.\nMr Cairns said the programme had a \"transformative effect\" on individuals with mental health issues. \n\"We can\u2019t afford to lose officers of their calibre,\" he said.\n\"If we lose those individuals, all that money that has been invested in training them, you have to start again.\"\nAccording to Mr Cairns, a report by Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen had shown that after a stay at the centre individuals were \"much more likely to get back into work more swiftly\" and \"less likely to have leave from being sick or injured\".\n\"We\u2019re getting individual officers, men and women, back on the frontline, which is where the vast majority of them want to be, serving the public,\" he added.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been sworn in as Bangladesh's interim leader, vowing to \"uphold, support and protect the constitution\".\nThe 84-year-old took an oath at the presidential palace in Dhaka along with more than a dozen members of his new cabinet, vowing to perform his duties \"sincerely\".\nHe flew into the capital, Dhaka, just days after Sheikh Hasina - the woman who ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist for 15 years - fled across the border to India.\nMs Hasina resigned as prime minister after weeks of student-led protests - which left hundreds dead - escalated and culminated in calls for her to stand down.\nThe decision to name Prof Yunus as chief adviser of the interim government followed a meeting between President Mohammed Shahabuddin, military leaders and student leaders.\nThe students had been clear they would not accept a military-led government, but wanted Prof Yunus to lead.\nAmong his new cabinet are Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, students who led the anti-government protests.\nThe hope is Prof Yunus, the so-called banker for the poor, will bring democracy back to Bangladesh after years of autocratic rule.\n\"People are excited,\" the entrepreneur and economist told the BBC moments after arriving in Dhaka from France on Thursday.\nHe later told reporters that Bangladesh \"has got a second independence\" as he called for the restoration of law and order in the nation of 170 million people.\nFollowing Prof Yunus's swearing in, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his \"best wishes\", writing on X/Twitter that his government was \"committed\" to working with its neighbour for \"peace, security and development\".\n\n\nProf Yunus paid tribute to those who died, saying they had \"protected the nation\" and given it \"new life\" after Ms Hasina's rule. \nShe had begun that rule as a symbol of democracy but, by the time she fled, she was considered an autocrat who had sought to entrench her authority by silencing dissent.\nPrisons were filled with people who sought to speak out against her. Prof Yunus - lauded for his pioneering use of micro-loans - was one of those who found themselves in legal trouble during her tenure.\nMs Hasina regarded him as a public enemy - he is currently on bail, appealing against a six-month jail term in what he has called a politically-motivated case. \nSpeaking on Thursday, he called on the country's young people to help him rebuild the South Asian country.\n\"Bangladesh can be a beautiful country, but we destroyed the possibilities,\" he said.\n\"Now we have to build a seedbed again - the new seedbed will be built by them,\" he added, gesticulating towards the students who had arrived to greet him.\nHis ascension as Bangladesh's interim leader follows weeks of turmoil. \nMore than 400 people are reported to have died after protests seeking to abolish a quota system for civil service jobs began in July.\nA third of these jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans from Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan, which took place in 1971. Campaigners argued the system was discriminatory and needed to be overhauled. \nThough this demand was largely met after the Supreme Court backed the students' demands and vastly reduced the scale of the quota system, the protests then transformed into a wider anti-government movement fuelled by crackdowns.\nBangladeshi media and demonstrators blamed police for the spiralling death toll. Officials maintained that officers only ever opened fire out of self-defence or to protect state property.\nStudents and their supporters had planned to march on the prime minister's residence on Monday.\nBut before the march could get properly moving, the news came that Sheikh Hasina had fled Bangladesh and resigned as prime minister. She is currently in Delhi.",
    "A mother-of-two has said she was in \"disbelief\" after giving birth in the foyer of a busy cinema. \nSarah Vincent, 32, had been watching a film at Cineworld in Spytty, Newport, last Wednesday when she suddenly felt the urge to push.\nWith no time to get to hospital, Ms Vincent delivered a baby girl in the foyer of the cinema with the help of staff and a member of the public.\n\"I was in disbelief,\" she told BBC News. \"I was like, 'did that really just happen? Have I dreamt this?'\"\nMs Vincent, who was one week away from her due date, recalled how she had been watching Sing 2 with her parents and her three-year-old son Liam when she began to feel uncomfortable.\n\"About half an hour into the film I was like, 'oh I can\u2019t stay here, I\u2019m going for a walk',\" she said. \n\"So I went out for a walk around the cinema and went into the toilet, and then I thought 'oh my god, I think I need to push'.\"\nMs Vincent said she \"hobbled\" out of the toilet and found a sofa where she lay down, before a member of staff went to fetch her mum, dad and son. \nThey attempted to help her to the car to go to hospital, but she was unable to make it out of the building.\n\"We got to the foyer and I was like 'Mum, I need to sit down',\" Ms Vincent recalled.\n\"A man brought me a chair and I said 'no I just need to lie down'. Then I was laid on the floor and I said 'Mum, I need to push'. \n\"I said, 'I don\u2019t want to give birth here but I think it\u2019s coming'.\"\nAndrew, one of the team leaders at the cinema, rang an ambulance and relayed the call handler's instructions to two women - a member of the public called Amy, who had stopped to help, and another cinema team leader called Jacey.\nWithin 10 minutes, the trio had helped Ms Vincent to deliver a healthy baby girl named Lowri, weighing 7lb 1oz (3.2kg).\n\"It's all thanks to those three that she came into the world really safely, in as safe a situation as possible,\" said Ms Vincent, from Caerphilly.\n\"It\u2019s so hard to put into words how grateful we are to them, because it could have been so different.\"\nMs Vincent's son was also born in dramatic circumstances - delivered in the back of a car by her partner, Gareth Miles.\nMr Miles, who was working in Cardiff when he got the call that Ms Vincent was in labour, got to the cinema as soon as he could and arrived just as she and baby Lowri were being taken to hospital by paramedics.\n\"I just remember him laughing,\" said Ms Vincent. \"I\u2019m pretty sure he put his hands to his head and was just laughing and thinking 'oh my gosh, this could only happen to you!'\n\"But also he was over the moon... I don\u2019t think he could believe it.\"\nMs Vincent, who was discharged from hospital later that day, said nobody was more excited about Lowri's arrival than brother Liam.\n\"He comes home from nursery and the first thing he does is run up on to the sofa, sit in the corner and ask to cuddle Lowri,\" Ms Vincent said.\n\"We\u2019re really enjoying the four of us being a family four.\"\nJacey Howcroft, one of the two team leaders who helped to deliver Lowri, said it was a shift she would \"never forget\".\n\"It was an all-round fantastic effort by everyone involved,\" Ms Howcroft said.\n\"I wish the family all the best and hope to see them again in the future, it was a blessing to be a part of the experience.\"\nMo Williams, general manager at the cinema, said Lowri had been gifted a \"lifetime unlimited membership\" of free trips to the cinema to celebrate her birth. \n\u201cWe're incredibly grateful to our quick-thinking team leaders Jacey and Andrew, who stepped in to help deliver the baby safely in our foyer,\" Ms Williams added.",
    "The Dutch singer Joost Klein, who was disqualified from the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest, will not be prosecuted over the \"backstage incident\" that led to his dismissal, Swedish authorities have said.\nKlein was banned from the grand final hours before it took place in Malm\u00f6 on 11 May, after a female camera operator accused him of \"threatening\" behaviour.\nHowever, on Monday, the Swedish prosecution authority said it could not prove that Klein \"had any such intention\".\nSenior prosecutor Fredrik J\u00f6nssom said the singer had made \"a movement that hit the woman\u2019s film camera\" but that the course of events \"was fast and was perceived differently by the witness of the incident\".\n\u201cToday I have closed the investigation because I cannot prove that the act was capable of causing serious fear,\" he added.\nThe singer's management said they were \"extremely happy and relieved\" that the case had been abandoned.\n\"The last few months have been terribly difficult,\" they said in a statement. \n\"Finally we can say it out loud: There was never a reason for this case.\"\nThe musician's response was more light-hearted: He posted a compilation of happy dog videos to his Instagram story and updated his biography to read \"Eurovision 2025\".\nKlein had been one of the favourites to win the 2024 contest with techno anthem, Europapa.\nThe song was dedicated to his father, who died of cancer when Klein was 12. Before he died, Klein had promised to enter Eurovision on his behalf.\nHowever, the singer's plan fell apart when he was suspended during dress rehearsals the day before the grand final. \nA day later, Swedish police confirmed that a man had been reported for making \"unlawful threats\" to a member of the camera crew, and Klein was disqualified.\n\nDutch broadcaster Avrotros, which is responsible for arranging the country's Eurovision entry, called the move \"disproportionate\".\nIt said that Klein had been filmed immediately after coming off stage \"against clearly made agreements\" and against his repeated indications that he did not want to be on camera.\nResponding to the Swedish prosecutor's decision to drop the case, the broadcaster said it would call a meeting with contest organisers the EBU to express its dissatisfaction.\n\"From the beginning, we have said that this disqualification was unnecessary and disproportionate and so it now appears to be. \n\"We are still deeply disappointed that the Europa adventure of Joost Klein and of the entire Netherlands was brutally ended in this way.\n\"The next step is to have a meeting with the EBU management about this matter at very short notice.\"\nHowever, the EBU defended its original decision to expel Klein from the contest for \"inappropriate behaviour\".\n\"Like all responsible employers, we do not tolerate inappropriate behaviour and will always respond to any workplace issues that are reported to us,\" it said in a statement.\nNoting that the contest's internal investigation was separate to the police inquiry, it added: \"This new development therefore does not have any impact on our decision, which we stand by completely.\"\nKlein's disqualification was not the only source of controversy at this year's contest.\nIsrael's participation was widely criticised amid the ongoing Israel-Gaza war, with several pro-Palestinian protests taking place around Malm\u00f6 Arena.\nItaly's Angelina Mango and Ireland's Bambie Thug were among contestants who complained of a \"tense\" and \"horrible\" atmosphere backstage. \nOther entrants accused the Israeli delegation of filming them and posting clips online without their permission.\nAvrotros said it would raise \"other objections about the course of events behind the scenes\" during its meeting with the EBU.\nIt noted that those complaints had previously been raised \"in a comprehensive letter of objection, which to date has remained unanswered\".\n\"The ball is now in the EBU\u2019s court,\" it concluded.\n",
    "Washington is absorbing the impact of Ukraine\u2019s lightning assault into Russia\u2019s Kursk region as the scale of President Zelensky\u2019s bold gamble emerges.\nUS officials are assessing how the incursion might reshape the political and military dynamics of the war, as well as the implications for Washington\u2019s long-shifting stance on how Ukraine can use American-supplied arms.\nThe stunning raid, catching both Russian and apparently Western leaders by surprise, highlights one of the riskiest dilemmas for the Western-backed defence of Ukraine: President Biden has consistently tried to empower Kyiv to push back Russia\u2019s invasion without risking an American escalation with Moscow. \nAs President Putin has always tried to portray the conflict as a war between Russia and the West, Mr Biden has sought to put clear limits on US policy to deflate that narrative and prevent a conflagration.\nBut Ukraine\u2019s Kursk assault - the largest incursion into Russia by a foreign military since World War Two, according to military analysts - has raised a series of urgent questions for the White House. \nDoes it rapidly expand the boundaries of Washington\u2019s set limits for how Ukraine can use American and Nato weapons systems? \nDoes it risk crossing Russia\u2019s red lines over Western involvement in the war? If not, has President Zelensky showed Washington he can call Mr Putin\u2019s bluff?\nDespite the risks and the uncertainty, there is a sense of surprised admiration among some in Washington at Mr Zelensky's move. Piecing together comments from US officials over the last week reveals something of the emerging position. \nThe administration insists Ukraine gave it no advance warning of the assault. White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre has said Washington had \"nothing to do\" with it.\nAs for the use of US weapons, the White House, Pentagon and State Department won't officially confirm whether they are being used, but it seems overwhelmingly clear that they are, given Ukraine\u2019s reliance on US and Nato weapons systems. \nVladislav Seleznyov, a former spokesman for the Ukrainian armed forces' general staff, told Voice of America that US-provided HIMAR rocket launchers had been critical to the advance. \nUS approval for the use of its weapons by Ukraine in the Kursk incursion is certainly being implicitly given. Pentagon spokesman Patrick Ryder said this week: \"We assess that they're within the policy boundaries that we've set. Those policies haven't changed as it relates to in particular to use of US weapons.\" \nOfficials say the assault is \"consistent\" with their policy \"from the very beginning\" for Ukraine to be able to defend itself against attacks coming across the border.\nBut Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh added: \"Again, we don't support long range attacks into Russia. These are more for crossfire. I'm not going to put a specific range on it.\"\nThe US is the single biggest arms supplier to Ukraine - making the relationship the most consequential for Ukraine\u2019s prospects. Just last week the Pentagon authorised its 63rd tranche of equipment in three years, including Stinger missiles and artillery shells. \nBut since the start of the Russian invasion President Biden's approach has been characterised by at first a refusal to send more even advanced weapons - including, consecutively, HIMARS rockets, Patriot missile defence systems and F-16 fighter jets - before later changing his mind.\nThe same goes for White House policy on Ukrainian attacks into Russian territory. For many months President Zelensky pleaded for permission to strike at military targets in Russia that facilitated attacks into Ukraine. \nIn May, Mr Biden finally authorised the use of US weapons to strike across the border into Russia but only in a limited range from the Kharkiv region - which was under Russian assault. The White House described Ukraine\u2019s permitted actions as \"counter-strike\" measures.\n\"They're authorised to be used in proximity to the border when [Russian military sites] are being used on the other side of the border to attack specific targets in Ukraine,\" said Mr Biden in June. \"We're not authorising strikes 200 miles into Russia and we're not authorising strikes on Moscow, on the Kremlin.\"\nA few weeks later, that same permission was extended to any point along the border where Russian forces were preparing to attack Ukraine.\nSince then, Mr Zelensky, along with some European allies and some Democrats in Washington, have urged the US to further \"untie\" Ukraine\u2019s hands. \nSpecifically, the Ukrainian leader wants to be able to use American-provided ATACMS or long range missiles to fire deep into Russia to take out drone or missile launch sites. Washington has refused.\nHovering ominously over all of such decisions are the warnings of President Putin, who has previously threatened to use \"all available means\" if Russia\u2019s territorial integrity is threatened. This in addition to his nuclear sabre rattling if he deems the West as posing an intolerable threat to Russia via the Ukr",
    "When Kyiv launched a cross-border raid into Russia\u2019s Kursk region bordering Ukraine, the question from some military experts was: \u201cWhy?\u201d\nOne of Ukraine\u2019s biggest battlefield issues is manpower. Russia has more soldiers and is inching closer to the eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk.\nSo, sending hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers into Russia itself is, shall we say, counterintuitive in the eyes of some.\nBut not all.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t accidental,\u201d said war expert Kostyantyn Mashovets in a Facebook post. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly part of one clear plan.\"\nMykhaylo Zhyrokhov, a military analyst, agrees. He told the BBC that Russia had been forced to redeploy some troops there from the front line in eastern Ukraine.\n\u201cIf you look at official reports, there were significantly fewer Russian glide bombs dropped in the Donetsk area,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat means the aircraft which carry them are now elsewhere in Russia.\u201d\nThis incursion is extremely unlikely to be Ukraine looking to occupy Russian territory, but if pulling in Russian forces was a goal, it is quickly being realised.\nRecent history could be playing a role too. Russia launched a major cross-border offensive of its own into Ukraine\u2019s north-eastern Kharkiv region.\nThe advance seems to have slowed after the US gave Ukraine permission to use its missiles on targets inside Russia.\nUkrainian fears of a similar attack into the northern Sumy region have been mounting in the subsequent three months.\nGiven constant Western worries of the war escalating, it\u2019s likely some sort of permission was granted for an operation of this size on Russian soil.\nIn general, very few senior Ukrainian figures are saying much about this attack.\nThe president's office told us: \u201cNo comment, yet.\"\nWhile similar incursions have happened before, it is the first time regular Ukrainian forces have been used in this way.\nWhere there is much more chatter, is across the border.\nRussian military channels were quick to report the assault involving hundreds of troops and several rocket and drone attacks.\nLocal officials were also swift in announcing casualties and evacuations. Neighbouring regions expressed a willingness to accept those forced from their homes.\nA state of emergency has been declared there as well.\nRussia\u2019s Defence Ministry even admitted troops were being redeployed in the direction of Sudzha, a town in the Kursk region.\nAt the top of the food chain there was Vladimir Putin being publicly briefed by his security chiefs. His Foreign Ministry spokesperson called the attack \u201cbarbaric\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d.\nIt was a Russian response which suggested it had been blindsided in a war of recent familiarity.\nUntil yesterday Russia had steadily been capturing territory while outnumbering Ukrainian forces.\nNow it has something else to think about.\nThe assault is already being presented by the Kremlin as evidence as to why it should continue to wage its war - an invasion it still frames as \u201cdefensive\u201d.\n\u201cThere are more questions than answers from events in the Kursk region,\u201d suggests Military analyst Mykhaylo Zhyrokhov.\nClearly for Ukraine, if it stalls or even prevents Russia from mounting a major attack in its north, it will see this operation as worth it.\n\u201cThe more pressure is exerted on the aggressor that brought the war to Ukraine,\u201d said President Zelensky in his evening address, \u201cThe closer peace will be.\u201d\n\u201cJust peace through just force.\u201d",
    "For the past two years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to transform India into a high-income, developed country by 2047. India is also on course to become the world's third largest economy in six years, according to several projections.\nHigh-income economies have a per capita Gross National Income - total amount of money earned by a nation's people and businesses - of $13,846 (\u00a310,870) or more, according to the World Bank.\nWith a per capita income of around $2,400 (\u00a31,885), India is among the lower middle-income countries. For some years now, many economists have been warning that India\u2019s economy could be headed for a \u201cmiddle income trap\u201d.\nThis happens when a country stops being able to achieve rapid growth easily and compete with advanced economies. Economist Ardo Hannson defines it as a situation when countries \"seem to get stuck in a trap where your costs are escalating and you lose competitiveness\".\nA new World Bank report holds out similar fears. At the current growth rate, India will need 75 years to reach a quarter of America's per capita income, World Development Report 2024 says. It also says more than 100 countries \u2013 including India, China, Brazil and South Africa - face \u201cserious obstacles\u201d that could hinder their efforts to become high-income countries in the next few decades.\nResearchers looked at the numbers from 108 middle-income countries responsible for 40% of the world\u2019s total economic output \u2013 and nearly two-thirds of global carbon emissions. They are home to three-quarters of the global population and nearly two-thirds of those in extreme poverty.\nThey say these countries face greater challenges in escaping the middle-income trap. These include rapidly ageing populations, rising protectionism in advanced economies and the urgent need for an accelerated energy transition.\n\u201cThe battle for global economic prosperity will be largely won or lost in middle-income countries,\u201d says Indermit Gill, chief economist of the World Bank and one of the study's authors.\n\u201cBut too many of these countries rely on outmoded strategies to become advanced economies. They depend just on investment for too long - or they switch prematurely to innovation.\u201d\nFor example, the researchers say, the pace at which businesses can grow is often slow in middle-income countries.\nIn India, Mexico, and Peru, firms that operate for 40 years typically double in size, while in the US, they grow seven-fold in the same period. This indicates that firms in middle-income countries struggle to grow significantly, but still survive for decades. Consequently, nearly 90% of firms in India, Peru, and Mexico have fewer than five employees, with only a small fraction having 10 or more, the report says.\nMr Gill and his fellow researchers advocate a new approach: these countries need to focus on more investment, infuse new technologies from around the world and grow innovation. \nSouth Korea exemplifies this strategy, the report says.\nIn 1960, its per capita income was $1,200 - it rose to $33,000 by 2023.\nInitially, South Korea boosted public and private investment. In the 1970s, it shifted to an industrial policy that encouraged domestic firms to adopt foreign technology and advanced production methods.\nCompanies like Samsung responded. Initially a noodle-maker, Samsung began producing TV sets for domestic and regional markets by licensing technologies from Japanese firms.\nThis success created a demand for skilled professionals. The government increased budgets and set targets for public universities to develop these skills. Today, Samsung is a global innovator and one of the world's largest smartphone manufacturers, the report says.\nCountries like Poland and Chile followed similar paths, the report says. Poland boosted productivity by adopting Western European technologies. Chile encouraged technology transfer to drive local innovation, famously adapting Norwegian salmon farming techniques to become a top salmon exporter.\nHistory provides enough clues about an impending middle-income trap. Researchers reveal that as countries grow wealthier, they often hit a \"trap\" at around 10% of US GDP per capita ($8,000 today), placing them in the middle-income range. That\u2019s roughly in the middle of what the bank classifies as \u201cmiddle-income\u201d countries.\nSince 1990, only 34 middle-income countries have transitioned to high-income status, with over a third benefiting from integration into European Union (EU) or newfound oil reserves.\nEconomists Raghuram Rajan and Rohit Lamba separately estimate that even at a very respectable per capita income growth rate of 4%, India\u2019s per capita income will reach $10,000 only by 2060, which is lower than China\u2019s level today.\n\u201cWe must do better.

    "The number of Colombians living in areas in which armed groups operate has shot up by 70% over the past three years, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) warns. \nThe NGO says there are now almost 8.4 million civilians living in conflict zones in which armed groups use intimidation and violence to control their lives.\nThe head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, told the BBC how rural communities in particular had come \"under siege\".\nMr Egeland, who is on a visit to Colombia, said rampant violence was not just harming Colombians, but also refugees and migrants passing through these areas. \nEight years after the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the country's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), violence has reached \"devastating\" levels, according to the NRC.\nWhile the demobilisation of the majority of the Farc rebels created a sense of hope in violence-wracked areas, the vacuum left behind was quickly filled by other armed groups. \nMr Egeland said that the battle between rival groups for control of territory and drug routes meant that in many regions, the situation was now worse than in the immediate aftermath of the peace deal. \nEntire families are affected by the violence. \nOne tactic used by the armed groups as a show of strength is to declare so-called \"paros armados\" (armed strikes), during which they order the civilian population to stay at home and refrain from going to work.\nThis does not just cause disruption to the community thus \"shut down\", it also deprives family breadwinners of their income and prevents children from going to school.\nNRC figures suggest that since January 2022, nearly 30,000 pupils have been affected by armed violence, some of them forcibly recruited by the gangs, while others have seen their schools attacked or taken over by armed groups.\n\n\nIndigenous and rural communities have been particularly hard hit by the expansion of the armed groups.\nMr Egeland described meeting members of the Eperara Siapidaria indigenous group in south-western Nari\u00f1o province who told him of their fears for the survival of their culture amid the threats and restrictions imposed by armed groups. \nAlready displaced by previous flare-ups of armed conflict, the group lives in a hard-to-reach jungle area north of the town of Tumaco. \nRoadblocks and mines placed by warring groups fighting in the region means they  cannot move freely and are unable to hunt.\n\nThe conflict in some parts of the country is so intense that communities are not just confined to their villages, but under virtual house arrest, Mr Egeland told the BBC. \nHe also stressed the effect that armed violence was having on those who have sought refuge in Colombia and the migrants who cross it on their way north to the United States.\n\"They're beyond desperation,\" he said, urging the international community to \"stop talking about border security and focus about human security instead\".

    "Manizha Talash knew the moment she first saw a video of a man spinning on his head that she would dedicate her life to breaking - a style of street dance.\nBut it is a dream for which she has risked her life, and the lives of her family, in order to fulfil. It has forced her to flee her country, and hide her identity.\nNow, as she prepares to step out on the world stage at the Paris Olympics, Manizha reveals her fight to become Afghanistan\u2019s first female breaker.\nManizha came to breaking late.\nShe had initially tried shoot boxing, turning to the Japanese martial art that mixes wrestling and kickboxing as a way to protect herself as she worked alongside her father, selling groceries from his cart in the streets of the capital Kabul.\nBut a few matches in, she broke her shoulder and had to give up.\nThen, aged 17, she saw the video of the man on his head - and soon discovered the Superiors Crew, a breaking collective based in Kabul.\nShe fell in love.\n\"I couldn't believe it was real,\" she says.\nAt the same time, she heard breaking would make its debut at the Paris 2024 Olympics. The dream was born - she just had to get there.\nBut it clearly wasn\u2019t going to be easy from the start.\nShe visited the Superiors Crew's training club in western Kabul, which was considered the country's pioneering centre for hip-hop and breaking, but it was not quite what she expected.\n\"When I entered the club it was full of boys,\" Manizha recalls.\nThe Superiors Crew's coach, Jawad Saberi, was also quick to size Manizha up too.\n\"She was so small,\" he remembers. \"I was doubtful because there were other b-girls who didn't stay long,\" he says, using the term for a female performer.\nBut her size was the least of their troubles.\nManizha's passion, shared with Jawad and the Superiors Crew collective, was risky and people were unhappy about it.\n\u201cEveryone was judging me\u2026 my relatives were saying words behind my back and complained to my mother,\u201d she recalls.\nOutside of her immediate family, there were also comments made on social media - which she didn\u2019t take seriously.\nBut then, in December 2020, a car bomb exploded near the club, bringing the violence which was killing so many across Afghanistan close to home.\n\u201cIt really scared me,\" she admits.\nYet it didn\u2019t stop her. For Jawad, it was all he needed to know.\n\"We were under attack, but she came back,\" he says. \"I saw that she had a dream to go to Paris 2024 - she was fighting for it. I said: 'She can do it.' I saw the future.\"\nAt home, things had taken a turn for the worse.\nHer father had been abducted by insurgents. He has not been seen since.\nShe became the main breadwinner for her family - a portion of which she saved for training.\nBut within months of the car bomb, the club was forced to shut its doors.\nThis time, the threat had come inside.\n\"Security forces stormed our club, walked over to a man and put a hood on his head,\" Manizha recalls. The man, they said, was a would-be suicide bomber who had been staking out the club for some time, planning an attack.\n\"They told us that this time we were lucky because there were people who wanted to bomb our club and if we loved our lives, we should shut it.\"\nEven now, Manizha did not stop breaking.\nShe did make one concession to the danger, however: Manizha changed her last name to Talash meaning \"effort\" or \"hard work\" in Farsi. It was a decision she hoped would protect her family in case they were threatened because of her link to the sport.\nAnd then, that August, the Taliban returned.\nSuddenly, Manizha\u2019s world - and the world of Afghan women and girls - began to contract.\nThey were barred from classrooms and gyms and told to wear top-to-toe clothing. Music and dancing were also effectively banned.\nThe breaking stopped.\nThe new restrictions forced Manizha and her friends to make a decision - they had to leave the country.\n\"If I'd stayed in Afghanistan, I don't think I'd exist,\" she says. \"They'd execute me or stone me to death.\"\nManizha and some members of the Superiors Crew, including Jawad, fled to Madrid in Spain.\nThey found work, and sent money home. But they also made connections with local breakers and practised anywhere they could - in clubs, on the streets and even in shopping malls.\nIt wasn't easy.\n\"Every night when I got to bed, I'd struggle with lots of questions,\" Manizha admits. \"'What can Afghan women do?' I'd ask myself.  'Why can't I do something for them?'\"\nShe knew that, following the Taliban's return, it would be almost impossible to compete for her home country in the Olympics. A small, gender-balanced team of six is taking part under the country\u2019s former flag - put together by the exiled Afghan Olympic committee, with no link to the Taliban.\nBut Manizha found another route to Paris. She had discovered she was eligible to compete for the Refugee Olympic Team, for athletes whose home countries are experiencing conflict or civil war, making it too dangerous for them to return.\nIn May, she was one of the athletes selected to represe",

    "A charity has been launched in memory of a Liverpool journalist and Hillsborough campaigner Dan Kay.\nHe died aged 45 in May last year. \nThe Dan Kay Foundation has been set up by Mr Kay's family, friends and newspaper colleagues and aims to tackle stigma around mental health while spreading kindness and creating opportunities for those less fortunate.\nMr Kay's cousin Amos Waldman, who is one of the co-founders, said it was both \"emotional and exciting\".  \nMr Kay worked for the Liverpool Echo, most recently as a sports writer and was a well-known campaigner on behalf of the families of the Hillsborough disaster victims. \nHe worked closely with the family of Anne Williams, whose 15-year-old son Kevin died in the disaster, co-writing her daughter Sara Williams's book With Hope in her Heart.\nFormer Liverpool Echo colleague and co-founder of the foundation, Sam Carroll, said helping others was central to Mr Kay's life.\n\"He wasn't someone who shouted about all the work he did; feeding the homeless on Christmas Day, delivering food hampers for those less fortunate across the city,\" Mr Carroll said.\n\"This was all stuff that came to light after Dan had died which I find quite remarkable.\"\nMr Waldman said the trustees and volunteers were looking forward \"to continuing Dan's great work\" adding the foundation had some fantastic events and initiatives to announce in the near future \"which will make a real change to the communities and organisations Dan cared so deeply about\".\nEarlier this year, an inquest into Mr Kay's death was adjourned pending a review into treatment Mr Kay received from Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust.\nMr Kay passed away after being struck by a train on 7 May 2023.\nAssistant coroner Joseph Hart said Mr Kay's contact with the trust's Liaison Psychiatry Team and Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team will be explored at the full inquest, expected to be held later this year.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Think of the hit BBC series The Traitors, and you might think of Claudia Winkleman, contestants scheming below their hooded cloaks - and that castle.\nIt is one of the biggest stars of the hugely popular reality show which pits a handful of secret traitors against faithfuls to win a potential cash prize of \u00a3120,000. \nA third series has already been film and this week it was announced there would be a fourth series and also a celebrity version.\nBut delve into its past and the castle has links with the makers of Worcestershire Sauce, and the land it was built on with the Highland Clearances.\nThe Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century pile about 30 miles north of Inverness. \nIt is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland near the Easter Ross town of Alness. \nThe property was built more than 170 years ago in a Scottish baronial style, a type of elaborate architecture featuring complex rooflines with turrets and fortress-like battlements.\nMore than 200 years ago - long before the castle was built - the land at Ardross was owned by George Granville Leveson-Gower, the 1st Duke of Sutherland.\nHe had a hunting lodge on the site where the castle stands today.\nThe duke was a controversial figure in the Highland Clearances.\nIn large parts of Sutherland, he had people cleared off land where they had lived for generations to make way for sheep farming and agricultural \"improvements\".\nSome families were moved to coastal villages, while others became emigrants and made difficult journeys to Canada to start new lives there.\nThere is a statue of the duke on a hilltop north of Ardross.\nKnown locally as The Mannie, and overlooking Golspie, it has been the target of vandalism and even attempts to topple it.\nYears later the estate at Ardross was bought by Sir Alexander Matheson.\nMatheson made his fortune trading in China. He was an MP and an instrumental figure in the building of railways in the Highlands.\nAnd he had the castle, so familiar to Traitors fans today, constructed.\nRoss and Cromarty Heritage Society says that from 1847, about 400 workers were involved in the property's construction.\nThey built 30 rooms and laid out the castle's extensive grounds.\nAccording to Ardross Castle's website, Sir Alexander also improved estate workers' housing.\nAfter Sir Alexander's death, the country house and its estate was sold to businessman and philanthropist Charles William Dyson Perrins.\nHis grandfather William Perrins, in partnership with John Wheeley Lea, created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce.\nThe Perrins family was also involved in the production of Royal Worcester porcelain.\nCharles William Dyson Perrins joined the family business after four years serving in the Highland Light Infantry.\nHe and his family were annual visitors to Ardross Castle.\nThe Perrins' ownership came to an end in the 1930s and various parts of the estate was sold off. \nIn 1983, the castle was bought by the McTaggart family and they still own it today.\nWhile not run as a hotel, the property is available as a wedding venue - its popularity undoubtedly boosted by its appearance in The Traitors.\nLast year Loukas Tsarmaklis, a director of Ardross Castle Enterprises, told The Press and Journal they \"try to keep a low profile... but there is no chance now.\"\n\"This has put us on the map and helped local B&Bs, tradesmen, taxi drivers, cleaners. It was a big operation for this part of the world,\" he added. \nThe castle's owners politely declined to comment on the impact the show has had to BBC Scotland News, but internet searches for the castle have been on the rise.\nRoss and Cromarty Heritage Society said views of its page about Ardross increased significantly last January because of the US show.\nTravel information site Places to Travel said Google data analysis suggested Ardross Castle had become the most searched for Scottish castle.\nOn the day episode one of the second series of the UK show aired in January, searches increased by 4,500% compared to the average volume over the last five years.\nThe BBC said series two has had 46m views on BBC iPlayer and an average of 8.1m views per episode.",

    "People involved in recent disorder in Northern Ireland are \"causing destruction to their own communities\" the deputy first minister has said.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)'s Emma Little-Pengelly told reporters at Causeway Hospital nothing was achieved by violence.\nShe said she wanted to send a \"very very strong message against racism\".\nShe was joined by DUP MP Gregory Campbell as they met with Northern Trust staff to acknowledge the role of overseas health workers in Northern Ireland.\nMs Little-Pengelly said people had \u201cvery genuinely held\u201d concerns about issues including \u201cpublic services and access to housing\u201d.\nShe added: \"Those are issues we need to address through government, through democratic means.\u201d\nThe Executive Office later said Mrs Little-Pengelly and First Minister Michelle O'Neill had spoken to businesses affected by the violence.\n\"They expressed their dismay and disappointment at the attacks, offered support to all those impacted and reiterated their strong determination to challenge racism and violence wherever it occurs,\" the statement said.\nAlso speaking at Causeway Hospital, Dr Ramoorthy Nambi who works in the stroke unit, said Northern Ireland had \"always been quite welcoming\", to those coming from overseas.\nHe said the scenes over recent days had been shocking.\n\"It makes you feel worried and fearful for even going about your daily lives,\" Dr Nambi said.\nHe said that while he had always experienced some racism from patients, said it had  \"definitely gotten worse in the past year\". \nDr Nambi said the violence was \"purely racist abuse\" that was dressed up in an \"anti-immigration cloak\".\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn said all politicians in Northern Ireland had a responsibility to call out recent disorder as \u201cracist violence\u201d.\nHe was speaking on a visit to a community centre in Belfast to see how the government could assist following recent disorder prompted by anti-immigration protests.\nHe also met political representatives, the police, affected business owners, and the Belfast Islamic Centre.\nMr Benn said he became increasingly angry when listening to the experiences of businesses whose premises had been attacked.\nBut he would not be drawn on whether the government would provide additional financial resources to assist the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\nHe said he was well \u201caware of the police numbers\u201d in Northern Ireland, but stressed that those decisions rested with the executive.\n\u201cWhoever is in government with the budget you've got, you've got to decide what your priorities are,\" he said. \n\"And I have no doubt that the chief constable is making his case as I'm sure the justice minister is doing as well. \n\"But that is a decision for the executive to determine.\u201d\n\u201cI hope very much that when the assembly reconvenes tomorrow, we will see all of the political parties in Northern Ireland united in their condemnation of what has been going on,\" Mr Benn said.\nHe added that all elected representatives had \"a responsibility to call out this racist violence for what it is, because it's targeted at a particular section of our community\".\nHe said people were entitled to protest and to express their political views, but there was no justification for violence.\nThe PSNI is understood to mobilising more officers due to concerns over further racially-motivated attacks in coming days.\nOfficer shift patterns are being adjusted and rest days cancelled.\nIt will result in an increase of officers on the streets, which should be visible.\nChief Constable Jon Boutcher will update the Stormont executive on Thursday morning.\nThe police do not believe loyalist paramilitary organisations are orchestrating or co-ordinating things.\nHowever, known loyalist paramilitary figures have been engaged in some of the protests.\nPolice and loyalist sources have spoken of weeks and months of simmering tensions which are boiling over.\nThey point to housing protests fuelled by anti-immigration sentiment, such as in Belvoir estate in November.\nPolice data has also shown a year-on-year rise in racially-motivated incidents.\nBut the trigger has been the Southport stabbings and associated protests and trouble in England.\nThe head of the Public Prosecution service said anyone involved in recent street violence would be pursued \"robustly\" through the courts.\nThe office of the most senior judge in Northern Ireland, Lady Chief Justice Dame Siobhan Keegan, said judges stood ready to deal with any prosecutions.\nOn Wednesday, a health care worker's home in Ballyclare was attacked in what police have described as a racially motivated hate crime.\nThe front window of a house in Erskine Park was smashed and a brick thrown through the windscreen of a car parked outside in the early hours of Wednesday.\nPolice said they were also aware of racist graffiti

    "Grahame Barritt has been involved in the protection of cows for over 25 years. \nHis love for their \"mothering instinct and gentle nature\" led the 59-year-old to set up his own sanctuary, called Sri Lakshmi Gaushala, in Ceredigion, 15 years ago. \nBut after a long time working with the cows alone, the ex-monk decided he wanted to share his passion for the farm animals with others. \nAnd so his cow cuddling service was born. \nCow cuddling, or \"koe knuffelen\" in Dutch, emerged in the Netherlands more than decade ago. \nSince then, it has gained traction in the US and across Europe. \nIt is believed to promote positivity and reduce stress, and is described by many of the places offering it as \"therapy\". \nLike Grahame's, most farms offer visitors the opportunity to sit with one or more of their cows for up to two or three hours. \nTheir warmer body temperature, great size and calm nature makes giving them a squeeze a \"meditative\" experience, Grahame said. \n\"People generally say how relaxed they feel afterward,\" Grahame said. \n\"Quite often after a session, a lot will even say they want to take a little nap.\" \nGrahame has observed over the years that just like humans, cows have their own unique personalities and quirks. \nThis means many visitors will find they connect with one in particular of the 12 cows at his sanctuary.\n\"Every session begins with an introduction to each cow, and I explain a little about their backgrounds and their life,\" he said. \n\"It's about the person making a bond or moving on and finding a cow that they want to spend some time with.\" \nOne of the people that says they have built a deep connection with a cow at the sanctuary is Natasha Williams. \nThe 42-year-old chose to sponsor Jaganath - or Mr Bear as he is fondly nicknamed - after visiting the west Wales site last year to meet cows \"on a more personal level\". \n\"It was felt so grounding and just really, really relaxing,\" Natasha said of the first session she spent at the sanctuary. \n\"I used to be quite scared of [the cows] because of the sheer size of them,\" she said. \n\"But once you get up close and personal with them, you just realise how beautiful they are.\"\nNatasha currently runs her own beauty business, but is training to work as a sound healer, using vibrations to promote healing and relaxation. \nShe therefore decided to ask Grahame whether he thought the cows would benefit from her practice, and now visits monthly to work with them. \n\"They find it really relaxing. You get signals from them.\" Natasha said. \n\"You see them having a release of some sort, they may yawn, or they may shake and cry.\"\nGrahame and Natasha are working towards offering sound baths - a form of meditation where those in attendance are \"bathed\" in sound waves - at the sanctuary alongside the cows.\nJessie, 27, said she has been \"obsessed\" with cows her whole life. \nThe librarian is originally from Massachusetts, US, but now lives in Edinburgh with her partner, where she often visits a local farm to spend time observing the highland cows there. \nThe pair saw a trip down south from Scotland to celebrate a friend's graduation as the perfect opportunity to fit in a session at Grahame's sanctuary. \n\"Since moving here, we've been really looking for an experience where we could get up close and personal with the cows and so this one seemed really perfect,\" Jessie said. \nShe found her time at Grahame's sanctuary \"incredibly centering\" and \"peaceful\". \n\"Even in being here just for a short time, you just forget everything else and you get to just look into their eyes and pet them.\n\"It's a really nice relaxing feel.\" \nGrahame said that over the last year, the sanctuary had been \"very busy\" as cow cuddling seems to be gaining popularity.\n\"Throughout the country and the world, cows seem to be becoming a lot more recognised for the gentle beings that they are,\" he said. \nHe is currently at the limit for how many cows can fit on the land he rents, but hopes that offering the cow cuddling sessions will eventually allow him to expand the sanctuary. \nFor now, however, he said he was thankful the sessions mean he also gets to spend more time with the animals. \n\"I used to feel like I never had enough time for the cows,\" he said. \n\"So doing the cuddling has been absolutely fantastic as they get loads of attention and affection.\"",

    "A mural dedicated to women's protection from violence has been vandalised by graffiti and efforts to obscure the artwork's safety message, prompting disappointment from the public.\nThe vibrant piece in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, by local artist Rob Fenton, depicts a woman with her head held high wearing a t-shirt that says \"women's safety is everyone's responsibility\".\nBut black scrawls of foul language were added to the piece, plus the addition of \"men's safety matters\" under attempts to wipe out the original slogan.\nThe defacing of the mural, created in the wake of the deaths of two female victims of violence, was described by one passerby as shameful. \nThe mural, located in a town centre alleyway, was commissioned by Newcastle-under-Lyme Business Improvement District (BID) in March 2022 following the murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa in London. \nThe BID secured \u00a334,000 in funding from the borough council to roll out a number of initiatives to raise awareness of sexual harassment and violence towards women, with the mural launched under its Get Home Safe project.\nNational Police Chiefs\u2019 Council figures state two million women a year are estimated to be victims of male violence, calling the issue a \"national emergency\".\nBen Adams, Staffordshire Commissioner for Police, Fire & Rescue and Crime said: \u201cReducing violence against women and girls \u2013 and the fear of violence \u2013 is a key priority for me, which is why my office secured funding from the Safety of Women at Night Fund for a range of initiatives to improve women\u2019s safety and transform previously neglected and unwelcoming spaces. \n\"This mural is one of the projects delivered in Newcastle and other areas using the funding, and I am disappointed to see that the artwork, and its important message, has been vandalised.\u201d\nA passerby told BBC Radio Stoke the vandalism \"wasn't fair at all\".  \nA worker at a nearby charity added anti-social behaviour in the area was on the rise. \nShe said: \"The artwork is brilliant, we were here when it was being done and it's great.\"",
    "A council leader has said government plans to increase housebuilding in England are a \"new challenge\" for the local authority.\nMore than 4,500 homes could be built each year across Northamptonshire under the new proposals.\nThe plans - out for consultation until September 2024 - would see a return to mandatory planning targets for councils.\nJason Smithers, Conservative leader of North Northamptonshire Council (NNC), said: \"With the government\u2019s support for infrastructure we can strive to achieve these new targets, creating sustainable communities people want to live and work within, whilst protecting and enhancing the environment.\"\nCouncils will be set targets that must be met so the government can honour its pledge to build 1.5 million homes by the end of this Parliament, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nIn Northamptonshire, this will mean local authorities will be bound to approve and build an extra 670 homes a year, on top of current housing goals. \nA mandatory target of 4,648 new homes per year will introduced in the county.\nFor NNC, the current target of 1,856 new homes every year would be increased to 2,064 - an 11% increase.\nWest Northamptonshire Council (WNC) has the largest target out of the authorities, at 2,584 homes per year, up from 2,124 - a 21% increase.\nBoth councils fell below their original yearly housing targets between 2020/21 and 2022/23.\nWNC missed its goal by fewer than ten houses, building 2,115 homes on average per year.\nNNC built 1,784 homes, missing its target by about 70 homes.\nMr Smithers said: \"For a number of years north Northamptonshire has been one of the fastest housing growing areas of the country. \n\"The council is in the early stages of preparing the North Northamptonshire Local Plan, which will identify growth to 2041.\"\nThe authority will discuss its response to the government\u2019s consultation at a meeting in September.\nJo Savage, chief executive of Greatwell Homes, which runs social housing in north Northamptonshire, said there was a need for affordable housing.\n\"For every property we have that becomes vacant we have between 30-40 applicants,\" she said.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Hours after Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday following mass protests, a development professional in the capital, Dhaka, received a panicked phone call from his cousin.\nAvirup Sarkar is a Bangladeshi Hindu, living in a country that is 90% Muslim. His widowed cousin lives in a sprawling joint family house in a mixed neighbourhood in Netrokona, a district crisscrossed by rivers, about 100km (62 miles) north from Dhaka.\n\u201cShe sounded terrified. She said the house had been attacked and plundered by a mob,\" Mr Sarkar, a social protection specialist, told me on the phone from Dhaka.\nHis cousin said the mob of about 100 people, armed with sticks, stormed the house, smashing furniture, TV, bathroom fittings and doors. Before leaving, they took all the cash and jewellery. They didn\u2019t assault any of the 18-odd residents, including half-a-dozen children belonging to seven families, that lived there.\n\u201cYou people are descendants of the Awami League! This country is in a bad shape because of you. You should leave the country,\u201d the mob shouted at the residents before leaving with the loot.\nMr Sarkar told me that he was shocked, but not entirely surprised by the incident. Hindu minorities in Bangladesh, he says, are largely viewed as supporters of Sheikh Hasina\u2019s secular Awami League party and are often attacked by rivals in a country where Islam is the state religion.\nAfter Ms Hasina fled the country, social media was flooded with reports of Hindu properties and temples being attacked. India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament on Tuesday: \"What was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses and temples also came under attack at multiple locations. The full extent of this is still not clear.\"\nHowever, young Muslim groups were also protecting Hindu homes and shrines to prevent further vandalism.\n\u201cBangladeshi Hindus are an easy target,\u201d Mr Sarkar told me. \u201cEvery time the Awami League loses power, they are attacked.\u201d\nThis was not the first time his cousin\u2019s house was attacked, Mr Sarkar says. Minorities in Bangladesh were targeted in 1992 after a Hindu mob tore down the Babri mosque in the Indian city of Ayodhya. Mr Sarkar\u2019s sister\u2019s home was ransacked by a mob.\nThere have been many religious attacks on Hindus in the following decades. A Bangladeshi human rights group, Ain o Salish Kendra, reported at least 3,679 attacks on the Hindu community between January 2013 and September 2021, including vandalism, arson and targeted violence.\nIn 2021, following mob attacks on Hindu minority households and temples in Bangladesh during and after Durga Puja, the country\u2019s biggest Hindu festival, rights group Amnesty International said: \"Such repeated attacks against individuals, communal violence and destruction of the homes and places of worship of minorities in Bangladesh over the years show that the state has failed in its duty to protect minorities.\" \nOn Monday, other members of Mr Sarkar\u2019s family also faced the prospect of violence. His parents' home in Kishoreganj, 120km from Dhaka, was spared because \"we are a well-known family in the neighbourhood and knew everyone\".\nMr Sarkar says his mother, who runs a local school, received a phone call from her business partner, saying that people were making lists of properties to attack.\nThe partner then said, \"Your name is not on the list. But please be careful.\"\nLater, Mr Sarkar\u2019s father, who had locked in the family, saw a small crowd congregating outside their iron gate.\n\"My father heard someone coming up to the crowd and telling them, \u2018Don\u2019t do anything here, not here'. The mob dispersed.\"\nBut some distance away, in the Nogua area of Kishoreganj, reports emerged of Hindu households being looted.\n\u201cI heard 20-25 houses had been attacked there. My Hindu friend\u2019s gold shop was broken into and the ornaments on display were looted. They could not break or take away the vault though,\u201d Mr Sarkar said.\nSome 200km north of Dhaka, Mr Sarkar\u2019s wife\u2019s home in a neighbourhood in Sherpur district was also on the edge. Although her house escaped attack, a mob looted a neighbouring Hindu home. The silver lining: as news of the violence spread, local Muslims rallied to form protective rings around Hindu homes and temples.\n\"This has also happened all over Bangladesh. Muslims have also protected Hindu properties,\u201d says Mr Sarkar.\nBut this is not where things ended. As night fell on Monday, a mob began collecting outside Mr Sarkar\u2019s 10-storey apartment building in Dhaka, where he lives with his wife and infant daughter. He reckoned they had come looking for a councillor from Awami League who lived in the same building.\n\"I came out on my sixth-floor balcony and saw the crowd throwing stones at the building and trying to break in. The gates were locked properly, so they couldn't enter. Some cars in the parking lot and window panes were damaged,\" Mr Sarkar says.\nBack in Netrokona, Mr Sarkar\u2019s cousin told him that the family feared more ",
    "It's pipe band practice time for the young musicians at Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans.  \nAfter a long day at school they emerge invigorated and enthusiastic with a variety of drums and pipes to make music in the playground.  \nThese youngsters are some of the relatively few state school pupils who have been given the chance to learn these traditional instruments, through funding from the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.  \nThey have embedded dedicated teachers at the East Lothian high school and feeder primaries. \nAnd as a result there are now three bands which are at the heart of the school community and identity.\nFifth-year pupil Daniel says it is one of the best things about school.\n\"It's been very important because it's helped me make more friends,\" he said.\n\"It's helped make the transition from primary school to high school a lot easier because I've got friends in the band. \n\"It feels like a sense of community, it brings everyone together\"\nThis term, even more children will be given the chance to learn the pipes and drums.  \nFor the first time Edinburgh City Council is employing two teachers to give lessons in schools across the city, as part of its music tuition service.  \nFellow fifth year pupil Lily plays the bass drum in the band at Preston Lodge and loves the music and the social aspect of it.\n\"You get to go on really good trips. You make loads of new friends and it helps with your confidence and mental health \"\nPreston Lodge tutor and Pipe Major Lee Moore is very proud of the young musicians and says it has provided them with new opportunities.\n\"It has been life-changing for some. We have two former pupils that are now earning their living with full-time bagpipe teaching jobs.\"\n\"There are kids that maybe have been on a different path, but there's a bit of structure with the pipe band environment and they learn life skills that have stood them in good stead and kept them on a good path. \n\"They're so dedicated, it makes it a real joy to teach. \"\nThe funding for the two new pipes and drums teachers has partly come from the Scottish Schools Pipe and Drums Trust. \nIts chief executive Alex Duncan says they have projects across Scotland, but they are not enough for all the children who want to learn.\n\"We're working in 22 local education authorities but even then we're not beginning to touch the demand that's out there to learn. \n\"If you introduce piping and drumming tuition into a school cluster consisting of a secondary school and its feeder primary schools, you can expect 150 to 200 children wanting to learn so this is the sort of demand that's out there.\"\nPipe bands are well established in many independent schools and they're slowly growing in the state sector. \nJohnstone High School in Renfrewshire is one example. Their young musicians will be going to Tartan Week in New York next year.  \nTutor and Pipe Major Keith Bowes is optimistic about the future. \nHe said: \"Generally speaking we're in a safe position because when you get a young person and they start progressing with it they tend to stick with it for life.  \n\"There's lots of good tuition going on, it's just a shame it's not across the board. But there is lots of good programmes we just need more of them.  \n\"We don't want to miss out on young talented people that could be playing these instruments.\"\nHe is hopeful that Scotland will do well as home-grown talent face up to stiff international competition at this year's World Pipe Band Championships which take place in Glasgow from Friday 16 August.\nThere is also a lucrative aspect to taking up the pipes, as many of the teenagers who are learning have discovered.  \nThere is money to be made at formal occasions, as well as busking.  \nPreston Lodge pupil Charlie has already had some gigs, and he loves that the pipes combine tradition with the modern.\n\"They're an instrument you can match to a guitar or a fiddle,\" he says.\n\"Even modern music as well, you can collaborate pipes into it because of big scale and variety of sound on them.  \n\"They're compatible with a lot of tunes and you can play a lot of pop songs and rock songs on the pipes as well as your traditional songs as well. \"\nAlex Duncan of the SSPDT says the benefits of being in a band include improved numeracy and literacy skills, and increased confidence and resilience.\nShe adds that playing the pipes and drums can lead to many doors opening.\n\"When you leave school if you've got a set of pipes you can help fund your post-school education. You can travel around the world with a set of pipes on your back.  \n\"It's a form of cultural diplomacy that's well known. Pipe bands also bring communities together and become a source of pride in the community. \"",
    "The future success of a racehorse can be detected in the animal\u2019s gut when it is just one month old, research suggests.\nA recent veterinary study analysed horses' poo, measuring the bacteria in the digestive systems of more than 50 thoroughbred foals over the first three years of their lives. \nThe study found the more types of gut microbes a foal had at just four weeks old directly correlates to its future health, and its success on the racecourse.\nThe findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports, add to an emerging biological picture regarding the importance of the trillions of microbes that live inside young animals\u2019 digestive systems - and their role in long-term health.\n\u201cGut health is absolutely critical,\u201d said lead researcher Chris Proudman, a professor\u00a0of clinical veterinary science at the University of Surrey. \n\u201cThere is a growing understanding that what happens in human guts and in animal guts \u2013  horses, in this case - has a profound influence on many aspects of health and disease.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s also about timing,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe nature of the gut bacteria in those first few weeks of life predicts the future health, and the future performance, of these horses.\u201d\nYoung racehorses provide veterinary scientists with an ideal opportunity for studying the gut. \nBreeders and trainers of thoroughbred foals typically keep highly detailed records of each animal\u2019s birth, diet and health, as well as any veterinary care they receive.\n\u201cAnything we can investigate \u2013 to help them be in as good shape as possible \u2013 is a really good opportunity for us,\u201d said Jane Black, co-owner of Chasemore stud farm in Surrey, which bred some of the foals involved in the research.\nOver the course of three years, owners and trainers recorded how their horses performed on the racecourse, including where they placed and how much prize money they earned.\nMeanwhile, scientists regularly collected faecal samples - by collecting horse poo from the stables - from each of the 52 young horses involved in the study. \nResearchers were then able to \u201cDNA fingerprint\u201d the samples, providing a regular read-out of the bacteria inside each animal's gut.\n\u201cWe can see the amount of bacteria present and identify the different types,\u201d explained Prof Proudman. \n\u201cThen we compared that with our health data, and with our racing performance data.\u201d\nThe study concluded that the more diverse the gut bacteria in a four-week-old foal, the fewer health problems - particularly respiratory diseases - the horse suffered in later life.\nResearchers also found a direct relationship between the number of different types of gut bacteria in a month-old foal and its performance on the racecourse when it was older.\nThe team of scientists also investigated the long-term consequences of young foals being treated with antibiotics. \nFoals treated with antibiotic drugs had fewer types of bacteria in their guts, and subsequently went on to win less prize money in their racing careers compared to horses that had not received early antibiotic treatment.\nProf Proudman said the discovery raised questions about the use of antibiotics, both in animals and in humans, in early life.\n\u201cWe need to think about things that happen in those first few weeks of life - to make sure that animals and humans' gut bacteria are in a good state at that stage.\n\"That appears to set them up for a healthy life in the future,\u201d he said.\nProfessor Roberto La Ragione, also at the University of Surrey, said:\u202f\u00a0\u201cThe next part of our study will examine how we can minimise disruption of gut bacteria when antibiotics have to be used to treat infections [early on].\u201d",
    "Proposals to rebrand a library in the Isle of Man's capital with be debated by the local authority on Wednesday.\nThe move to rename Henry Bloom Noble Library, on Duke Street, to Douglas City Library was suggested following the granting of city status in 2022.\nThe plans were referred to the council's Executive Committee after opinions in the  Regeneration and Community Committee (RRC) were divided.\nThe change, which could see \u00a39,150 spent on new signage if successful, are set to be voted on at the local authority's August meeting.\nIf approved, about \u00a36,000 of the funding would come from income services and property maintenance funds, while the library would field the remaining costs itself.\nPhilanthropist and businessman Henry Bloom Noble, who died in 1903, bequeathed large sums of money to the Manx government, which saw the creation of Noble's Hospital and Noble's Park.\nThe Douglas library was renamed in his honour in 2002.\nWhile there was support for the idea of a rebrand at a July meeting of the RRC, concerns were raised about the costs of the exterior signage and window vinyl.\nIt was however noted they were \"nearing end-of-life\" and needed to be replaced, so the proposal to rename the facility had come forward to coincide with that.\nMembers agreed that surrounding properties on Duke Street had recently been externally refurbished, which had made the current signage \"look outdated in comparison\".\nTwo councillors Andrew Bentley and Frank Schuengel backed the change, but the two other members of the RRC, John Skinner and Stephen Crellin, voted against it.\nAfter reviewing the proposals in early August, the executive committee supported the plans, noting the previous name change from the then Borough Library in 2002.\nThe agenda for the meeting states the tribute to Mr Noble came about after the then-committee agreed a statue in his honour should not be built as the money \"could be better used elsewhere\".\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

    "Recent industrial action by Aer Lingus pilots is expected to cost the airline at least \u20ac55m (\u00a346.5m), the airline has said.\nThe figures are contained in the company's latest set of financial results, as reported by Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9.\nThe pilots' pay dispute led to the cancellation of 610 flights due to a two week work-to-rule and an eight-hour strike.\nLast week, members of the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association (IALPA) voted in favour of accepting Labour Court proposals which included a pay increase of 17.75% over four years.\n\nPilots initially demanded a 24% pay rise, arguing their pay has not kept up with high inflation levels since their last pay increase in 2019.\nIn a statement on Thursday, Aer Lingus said: \"The industrial action will have an expected \u20ac55m direct financial cost to the business over quarter two and  quarter three, before including the impact on forward bookings.\n\"Following the resolution of the pilot pay dispute through a Labour Court recommendation which delivered structural change for the business, Aer Lingus is assessing the implications of the financial damage caused by the dispute in the context of the current competitive environment and the passenger cap at Dublin Airport.\n\"This will include a review of the weaker parts of the airline's network and its cost base.\"\nAer Lingus\u2019 operating profit for the second quarter of 2024 was \u20ac92m (\u00a377.5m), down by \u20ac29m (\u00a324.5m) compared to the second quarter of 2023.\nThe airline made an operating loss of \u20ac82m (\u00a369m) in the first quarter of the year resulting in an operating profit for the first half of 2024 of \u20ac9m (\u00a37.5m).\nAer Lingus said its results in the second quarter of the year were impacted by market pressures across the Atlantic and the recent industrial action by pilots.\n\"Competitors across the Atlantic increased their capacity into Ireland by 20% this summer, putting pressure on Aer Lingus\u2019 long-haul revenues, particularly in the economy cabin,\" it said.\nUnions representing other groups of workers at Aer Lingus met on Thursday to discuss the implications of the pilots' pay deal for their members.",
    "Parts of the UK will be treated to another celestial delight on Monday evening, as the Perseid meteor shower continues to streak the sky. \nThe spectacle began on Sunday night and is expected to continue into Tuesday morning.\nThe Perseids pass through our atmosphere every year when the Earth orbits through debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet.\nExperts say the best chance to spot a meteor begins just after midnight and ends about an hour before sunrise, but it is worth checking the weather where you are. \nThe Met Office said viewing conditions will be good with perhaps as many as 100 meteors every hour on Monday night into Tuesday.\nA coronal mass ejection - eruptions of magnetic fields and solar storms - from the sun may also give an enhanced chance of seeing the Northern Lights in northern areas of the UK, the national weather service added.\nThe Perseid meteors are visible all around the world and are so-called because they appear to originate from within the constellation Perseus.\nWhile on most nights the shower will only showcase a few meteors each hour, the peak of the Perseids can bring many, many more.\nIf you're really lucky, you could see 100 or more meteors per hour, scientists say.\nWe see meteors when the Earth passes through trails of debris from comets or asteroids. As that debris hits our planet's atmosphere, it burns up and creates spectacular streaks of light.\nThe Perseids - pronounced 'Per-see-ids' - are caused by debris left behind by the Swift-Tuttle comet.\nDr Gregory Brown, Senior Public Astronomy Officer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, said that the Perseids is one of the fastest meteor showers. \n\"They travel up to 37 miles per second, but they are about the size of specks of paint or grains of sand falling into the atmosphere,\" he said. \n\"While that does cause this rather brilliant light show, they've absolutely no chance of hitting the ground. And even if they did, they\u2019re these tiny little things so they wouldn't cause any harm.\"\nTo find the Perseid meteor shower, it is best to look for the point in the sky where they appear to originate from, which is known as the radiant.\nThe Perseids' radiant is in the Perseus constellation. A stargazing app can help you find the exact location you should look towards, depending on your location in the UK.\nBut try to get to the darkest location you can with an wide, unobstructed view, as the meteors can appear in any section of the sky.\nThe darker it is where you are, the better chance you'll have of seeing meteors streaking across the sky - and give your eyes at least 30 minutes to adapt to the night.\n\u201cFill your view with as much of the sky as you possibly can, lying down or using a deck chair and then just wait and allow your eyes to adapt to the dark and eventually, fingers crossed, if it's nice and clear and you're watching for an hour or so, you should at least be able to catch a handful,\" said Dr Brown.\nMonday night going into the early hours of Tuesday is expected to have the clearest viewing conditions for most of the UK, BBC weather forecasters say. \nBBC weather's Billy Payne said Tuesday night will see \"good clear skies\" in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nThere may be some some rain and areas of cloud with \"clear spells in between\" in the south and east of England, he said.\n\"Parts of north and the west of England are likely to be stuck under a front, meaning limited viewing potential for many,\" he said.\nCheck the forecast in your area on BBC Weather here\n\nSend your images and videos to us here",
    "Nearly 1,000 protesters have been involved in disorder after a protest in one of England's best-known seaside resorts.\nBottles were thrown at police, as officers struggled to contain the demonstrators, who were mainly from far-right groups, in Blackpool.\nSome demonstrators were seen making racist gestures and heard shouting racist abuse as they were held back by police horses and dogs.\nA number of people were arrested in connection with the disorder.\nProtesters initially gathered near Blackpool cenotaph but proceeded through the town\u2019s streets, forcing police to cordon off much of the town centre by early evening.\nThe protest coincided with the resort's annual Rebellion punk festival and some of those attending staged a counter-protest.\nIt led to a tense stand-off between the two groups, in which chairs, bottles and planks of wood were thrown.\nOutside St John\u2019s Church, one man fell to the ground and needed medical attention and a number of glass bottles were smashed against the church walls.\nAfter clashes died down, a later flare-up saw about 40 protesters kettled by police, with several of them being arrested.\nLancashire Police said there had also been protests in Preston and Blackburn and it had introduced dispersal orders in all three areas.\nThe force said it had made \"more than 20\" arrests across the county in connection with the protests, with people being held on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon, police assault, possession of a bladed article, obstructing police, conspiracy to commit violent disorder and failing to adhere to a dispersal order.\nA representative added that no officers had been injured in the operation.\nAssistant Chief Constable Phil Davies said a \"significant number\" of the arrests followed \"tension in Blackpool\" and some \"minor disruption\" in parts of Preston and Blackburn.\n\"In Blackpool, we have witnessed some mindless thuggery from individuals, who we believe to be from outside of the county, intent on causing issues in our communities,\" he said.\n\u201cWe have also seen some small pockets of tension elsewhere in the county, but, thanks to a robust partnership response to our policing plan, this was swiftly dealt with.\n\u201cI would like to thank the good people of our communities for their support.\"\nIn a statement on X, Blackpool South MP Chris Webb said he was \"angered to see senseless violence and disorder on the streets of my hometown\".\n\"The people responsible are harming residents and damaging livelihoods,\" he said.\nBlackpool was one of a number of towns and cities across England which saw unrest.\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said she would work with police forces to help ensure \"consequences, arrests and prosecutions\" for those responsible and warned that anyone engaging in \"unacceptable disorder\" would pay the price.\nThe protests came in the wake of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class being fatally stabbed in Southport on Monday.\nViolence erupted the following evening in the Merseyside resort, with police blaming far-right groups.\nFalse claims have spread online that the person responsible was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat and a Muslim.\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, from Banks in Lancashire, has been charged with three counts of murder, 10 attempted murders and possession of a curved kitchen knife.\nThe 17-year-old, who was born to Rwandan parents in Cardiff and moved to the Southport area in 2013, has no known links to Islam.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Democratic congresswoman and \"Squad\" member Cori Bush has lost her primary race in Missouri, according to US media projections. \nWesley Bell, a St Louis prosecutor, will instead be the party's candidate in the state's first congressional district this November. \nMs Bush, a nurse, came to prominence as an organiser in the Black Lives Matter movement and, after taking office in 2021, as one of the Democratic members of the \"Squad\", who are known to support progressive causes. \nShe has been a vocal critic of Israel's war in Gaza, with pro-Israel groups spending more than $10m (\u00a37.9m) on efforts to unseat her in the primary.\nProjections from both the Associated Press news agency and NBC News suggest Mr Bell is on track to win the vote with 51% of ballots cast, compared to Ms Bush's 46%. \nThe district is a strongly Democratic area and Mr Bell is expected to hold it in the November general election. \nAlmost all the money spent in campaigning against Ms Bush reportedly came from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). Aipac is a pro-Israel lobbying group and has vowed to spend over $100m to unseat progressive lawmakers who have spoken out against the war in Gaza, Politico reported.\nIn her concession speech, Ms Bush declared: \"All they did was radicalise me, so now they need to be afraid.\"\n\"Aipac, I'm coming to tear your kingdom down,\" she added. \nIt marks the second loss for the Squad - a group of nine progressive Democrats in the US House of Representatives - during the 2024 election cycle. \nIn June, more than $15m was put into a successful bid to oust Jamaal Bowman, another critic of Israel, from his seat in New York. The figure was the most spent in any House primary in history. Mr Bowman was ousted just weeks after he was censured for pulling a fire alarm while the House was in session.\nSpeaking to CBS News, the BBC's US news partner, ahead of the vote, Mr Bell accused Ms Bush of \"not doing her job\". \n\"She is not working with others, and it's hurting our district.\"\nMs Bush defended her record to the outlet: \"My community knows who I am. They know that I am going to fight for the people in the streets.\"\nLess than two weeks after the 7 October attacks, Ms Bush introduced a resolution calling for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid.\nThe attacks, carried out by Hamas and other armed militant groups saw around 1,200 people killed in Israel and another 251 taken to Gaza as hostages.\nIn response, Israel declared a \"complete siege\" on Gaza, cutting off supplies of electricity, food, fuel, and water. To date, more than 39,600 people have been killed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nMs Bush also boycotted a joint address to Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July, calling him a war criminal and saying he was at the forefront of a genocide. Dozens of House and Senate Democrats boycotted Mr Netanyahu's address. \nIn a statement ahead of the vote Ms Bush accused Mr Netanyahu of perpetrating a \"genocide\" in Gaza and claimed Congress was \"actively celebrating\" his actions. \nMs Bush has also been investigated by the justice department, House ethics committee and Federal Elections Commission for her campaign spending, mostly over allegations that she improperly paid her husband, a security guard, for protection.\nShe previously said any claims she had misused federal funds were \"simply false\".\nThree other US states - Kansas, Michigan and Washington - also held primary elections on Tuesday.\nDan Newhouse, one of the last remaining Republicans to have voted to impeach Donald Trump, appeared to have scraped through in his primary election.\nWashington state holds what is known as a jungle primary, allowing the top two finishers - regardless of party - to advance to the general election.\nMr Newhouse, an agricultural scientist who has represented a central Washington district since 2015, faced off against two Trump-endorsed candidates - Navy veteran Jerrod Sessler and ex-nurse Tiffany Smiley.\nEarly projections of the race show Mr Sessler leading Mr Newhouse, with Ms Smiley close behind them - meaning that the incumbent could face a difficult challenge in November. \nOf the so-called \"Impeachment 10\" - Republicans who voted in favour of Trump's impeachment - only Mr Newhouse and California's David Valadao remain in the House. \nAll other pro-impeachment Republicans have either left Congress since their 2021 vote or been defeated in primary races.",

He did brilliantly on it so I'll be getting a few tips from him, for sure,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday, Dean, James Guy, Matt Richards and Duncan Scott made history in the men's 4x200m freestyle relay final after being the first swimming team to ever to defend an Olympic relay title with the same quartet.\nHe admitted that he doesn't \"do too well out of water\", but was looking forward to \"throwing myself into\" the show. \nHe added that he \"knows what a hard day's training is like\".\nOther celebrities who have been rumoured to be joining this year's series include Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham, DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles and former Arsenal player Paul Merson.\nDean's announcement comes amid a storm of controversy over the treatment of some contestants on the BBC show.\nAn investigation, launched by the BBC following allegations made about Giovanni Pernice by former dance partner Amanda Abbington, will reportedly be concluded soon.\nThe Sherlock actress told BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour on Friday that their rehearsals would sometimes \"descend into chaos\".\n\"I was trying my best and I know I don't deserve to be spoken to like that. I was coming into the rehearsal room with a positive outlook to do my best, and that was not being reciprocated,\" she said.\n\"I recognised the red flags and bad behaviour because it's happened in the past,\" she added. \nThe 50-year-old added: \"I don't think women should have to go through this and we should be able to say, 'This behaviour is affecting me and someone needs to do something about it'.\" \nThe Italian professional dancer has rejected allegations of \"threatening or abusive behaviour\".\nThe dancer's spokesperson said: \"We would urge people to wait for the review's conclusion and not to pay heed to these very serious and defamatory allegations that have no evidence in support of them.\"\nPernice and another professional dancer, Graziano Di Prima, have both left the show.\nDi Prima's spokesman admitted the dancer kicked his partner Zara McDermott in a rehearsal last year.\nDi Prima has said he deeply regrets \"the events that led to my departure from Strictly\", and that his \"intense passion and determination to win might have affected my training regime\".",
    "A father says his four-year-old son has been left \"horrified\" after his specially-modified motocross bike was stolen.\nThieves managed to remotely open a van containing Cooper's bike, which was parked outside the family home in Chellaston, Derby, on 31 July.    \nA pledge had been made to eventually pass the bike on to the family of Cooper's friend Teddy, who had also ridden it before he died from cancer at the age of six earlier this year. \nPolice said officers were investigating the theft and appealed for anyone with information to contact them.\nCooper's main sponsor - Paul Grimshaw Vehicle Movements - has since bought him a new bike so he can continue to race.  \nHowever, Cooper's father Callum said his son was so worried \"bad guys were coming\" that he was having nightmares and had taken to sleeping in his parents' room.  \nHe said: \"Cooper was horrified at the theft, he doesn't understand that there's  people out there who don't care.\n\"He told me 'daddy I don't want to live in England any more'.\"\nCallum said the family of Cooper's friend Teddy had asked if they could have the bike when he was finished with it, because it was the last bike he rode before his death in April.\nTeddy, from Rotherham, had neuroblastoma, a rare, aggressive and complex cancer most common in children under five, according to Cancer Research UK.\nCallum said: \"I feel I've let Teddy's dad down with it being taken.\" \nTeddy's father Richard said the theft was \"disappointing\" and \"a shame\".\n\"Someone knows it is a children's bike as soon as they take it,\" he said.\n\"Now Cooper can't have fun on it.\"\nHe said they wanted to give it to their other son, aged three, after Cooper had finished with it.\n\"It would have been nice for him to have the bike Ted had, \" he said.\nCallum said both his house and the neighbouring property in Royal Approach had cameras but it appeared the thieves disabled them so the theft was not recorded.  \nHe added there was a reward for the return of the bike and no questions would be asked.  \n\"We just want it back,\" he said. \"Even if someone brings it on behalf of who took it.\"\nDerbyshire Police said the theft of an electric motocross bike had been reported to the force and inquiries were continuing.  \nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Opposition councillors are demanding answers about the delayed plans for a \u00a350m live entertainment venue in Bradford.\nThe 3,800-seat venue in the old Odeon Cinema building on Godwin Street and was due to open in November, but the only announced events have been cancelled.\nOne opposition group on Bradford Council has criticised a lack of transparency and said it wants restrictions on releasing information relating to the venue to be lifted.\nCouncillor Alex Ross-Shaw, a director at Bradford Live, said: \"We will deal with any requests for information that members ask for in accordance with our usual processes.\"\nAlthough work on the building has been completed, there has been little information released about when it will open.\nA Conservative and Queensbury Independent Group spokesperson said it was an \"alarming sign\" that something was \"very seriously amiss\". \nCouncillor Mike Pollard also said his party needed to know if contracts between Bradford Council and the developers, NEC Group, had been revised and if so, why the need for secrecy. \nThe BBC understands the final cost of the project could reach \u00a350m in the long term and that the council has taken on additional borrowing. \nBradford Live was also due to have its first shows in November, but they were subsequently cancelled and customers were refunded.\nSenior jobs advertised for the venue appear not to have been filled six months on from when the vacancies closed.\nMr Pollard called it \"exceptional\" that after NEC Group\u2019s Phil Mead pledged a 30-year commitment to Bradford Live, the council was unable to answer questions about its delayed opening in a \"timely manner\". \nHe said: \"People are right to wonder, 'if all publicity is good publicity, how bad is this?'\n\"We are now at the stage of Practical Completion so I cannot think of a legitimate reason why local people are being kept in the dark about things such as the reasons behind the cancellation of gigs, no schedule of events, not even an opening date.\" \nMr Pollard also said he recognised it was necessary to keep contractual details unpublished, but elected members of the council had the right to access certain information in order to scrutinise any key decisions. \nHe added: \"The current radio silence isn\u2019t fair to the taxpayer who has stumped up circa \u00a350m, with Bradford Council being on the hook for \u00a343.75m of that total.\"\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Mr Ross-Shaw, portfolio holder for regeneration, planning and transport, said that \"the legal processes related to the handover to the NEC Group are currently progressing\".\nHe added: \"Bradford Live is an exceptional event space and will serve as a pivotal catalyst for economic growth and investment in Bradford.\"\n\"It is a key component of our regeneration of the city centre.\"\nThe NEC group has been contacted for a comment.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

The 21-year-old man, who is not named, tells the paper he now feels he was \"groomed\" by Edwards. He alleges the newsreader \"fed on his vulnerability\", knowing that he had recently become homeless and needed money. Edwards has not commented on the claims.\nThe Sun newspaper carries an account from the young man's step-father, who says he went to confront Edwards at a railway station in May last year, after discovering they had planned to meet there. Edwards wanted the young man to sign a non-disclosure agreement, the man claims. A police investigation into the allegations earlier this year found no evidence of criminality.\nThe Telegraph reports on an investigation carried out by the Ministry of Defence after it emerged that software used by Britain's nuclear submarine engineers was designed in Russia and Belarus. The paper says the inquiry found the firm that outsourced the work to developers in Siberia and Minsk initially kept it secret, but later discussed whether it could disguise where the workers were based by giving them false names of dead British people.\nThe shadow defence minister James Cartlidge is quoted as saying \"the UK must not be over-reliant on certain suppliers for items that are significant for our critical infrastructure\".

    "A five-day festival in Cornwall is opening its gates to an estimated 58,000 people.\nSurf and music festival Boardmasters, which had its capacity increased from 53,000 in February, is being headlined by Chase & Status, Sam Fender and Stormzy.\nDevon and Cornwall Police are providing extra patrols and have issued advice to keep people safe, including encouraging people to report inappropriate behaviour and to not take illegal substances.\nThe National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) announced two days of strike action on Friday and Monday and two days of industrial action withholding overtime on Saturday and Sunday.\nFirst Bus said there would be disruption to services in Kernow, buses of Somerset and Adventures by Bus services.\nBoardmasters said the Big Green Coach was providing more than 80 pickup points across the UK and a Boardmasters park and ride service for day ticket-holders.\nA shuttle service from Newquay train station and between Fistral Beach and Watergate Bay was also available, festival bosses said.\nOn top of 11 music stages, there will be a zen den, outdoor cinema, muscle beach and surf experiences, and organisers said sustainability was a \"core part\" of its plans.\nSupt Russell Dawe, silver commander for Boardmasters for the second year in a row, said the priority was to ensure people's safety.\nHe said: \"What we do is we use our resources [officers] that are trained and have a specialism in relation to crowd dynamics and dealing with these type of large-scale events to make sure everybody's safe.\"\nSupt Dawe advised festival goers to \"not bring drugs\".\nHe said: \"Don't do drugs at the festival - come and enjoy it, but please don't undertake criminality.\n\"Don't bring valuables with you - don't bring expensive laptops and other IT equipment, and keep everything with you. \n\"This is a cashless event, so you don't need to bring big amounts of cash.\"\nJohn Dean, owner of Pechanga! restaurant, said his business would be getting involved with the festival to \"make up for the quiet time\" it usually experienced.\nHe said: \"Generally, for us as a business, we see a spike in business before Boardmasters and after Boardmasters. \n\"But, during it, it seems like the people are at the festival spending their money.\"\nMr Dean said his business would be operating out of a food van on the beach.\n\"We've never had the shop and van running at the same time,\" he said.\nShane Griffiths, who works in Playland Amusements, said the event was good for the local economy \"as long as they run it properly\".\nHe said: \"The last two years the police have shipped them straight off to the campsite and the businesses along this stretch of road at Station Parade miss out on a lot of trade.\n\"I know here and the chip shop next door, they all did extra food last year; they had extra staff on and we had staff standing around because they wouldn't allow them past the barriers of the train station, which does affect the local economy.\" \nCary Pearce, who owns The Chippy, said business was quiet at the beginning but picked up later on in the week.\n\"I love it, it's great for us... from Thursday, right through to Monday, it's heaving.\"\nMs Pearce said the event deterred regulars and holidaymakers from her shop.\nShe said: \"Even though it seems like there's a lot of people coming through the doors, they maybe are only coming in for a tray of chips.\n\"It's not this absolute fortune that everyone thinks that you'd make through, as you've got to get extra stock, extra staff - you have to be open for more hours.\"\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "GPs across England will start capping the number of patients they are willing to see, after the British Medical Association (BMA) announced an immediate work-to-rule action.\nThe BMA has told its members they can limit appointments to 25 a day \u2013 some GPs see more than 40 at times - in a dispute over funding levels.\nIn a ballot, 98% of GP members backed taking action, with the union saying a lack of funding is putting practices at risk.\nNHS England has warned the action could cause significant disruption beyond just GP services.\nIn a letter to senior NHS managers last month it said this could include increasing pressure and waits in A&E, slowing down the discharge of patients to hospital, and disrupting referrals into hospital for planned treatments, like hip and knee operations.\nIt warned that, as with other disputes, \u201cmaintaining services for patients with urgent needs, such as deteriorating conditions\u201d was key.\nBut NHS England national director for primary care Dr Amanda Doyle said if a patient needs to see a GP they should \"continue to come forward for care as practices will remain open\".\n\n\nThe BMA is suggesting a range of different actions could be taken by GPs, but it will be up to GPs themselves to decide what they want to do.\nOne option is to limit the number of patients they see to 25 a day \u2013 which the BMA deems to be the safe level. If every GP stuck to that it would reduce the number of appointments by a third, but it is unclear how many will follow the work-to-rule.\nNot all GPs are BMA members and turnout in the ballot was just under 70%. The BMA said the impact is likely to be a \"slow burn\" rather than a \"big bang\".\nGPs could also refuse to carry out tests and assessments for hospitals pre or post-treatment, and could ignore guidelines on rationing treatments that are put in place to allow the NHS to prioritise the most in-need patients.\nThe BMA believes none of this action will put GPs in breach of their contract. GP practices are essentially independent businesses, so they are paid a lump sum by the NHS to deliver care and therefore are not directly employed.\nBMA GP leader Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer said: \u201cGPs are at the end of their tether. This is an act of desperation. For too long, we\u2019ve been unable to provide the care we want to. \n\"We're witnessing general practice being broken. The era of the family doctor has been wiped out by consecutive governments and our patients are suffering as a result.\"\nThe action being taken does not count as formal industrial action and therefore the union can carry on with the work-to-rule indefinitely.\n\nLouise Ansari, chief executive of patient watchdog Healthwatch England, said she was worried about the action, given the difficulties patients already face getting access to GPs.\n\u201cWithout proactive communications to patients, the work-to-rule action could exacerbate access problems or even deter people from seeking help altogether.\n\u201cPatient safety must be paramount. We strongly urge all GP practices to inform their patients if and when they are taking part in the action and where to go for alternative help.\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s essential that the BMA and NHS England work with urgency to resolve the GP contract dispute.\u201d\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting expressed disappointment too. \"I can totally understand why GPs would want to punish the previous Conservative government, but this action, if it goes ahead, will only punish patients. \n\"The Conservatives already got their kicking at the general election and we now have a Labour government that's really committed to working with GPs to rebuild general practice so that people can get a GP appointment when they need one.\"",
    "Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed with a \"short-range projectile\" fired from outside his guesthouse in Tehran, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) says.\nThe paramilitary organisation said the projectile weighed about 7kg (16lbs) and caused a \"strong blast\", killing Haniyeh and his bodyguard last Wednesday. The Hamas leader had been visiting the Iranian capital for the inauguration of President Massoud Pezeshkian.\nThe IRGC accused Israel of designing and implementing the operation - supported by the US. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death.\nThe IRGC account is at odds with reports in Western media, which have suggested that explosives were planted in the guesthouse by Israeli operatives.\nThe failures surrounding Haniyeh's death, especially on a day marked by intense security, have caused embarrassment for Iran and the IRGC.  \nDozens of IRGC officers have been arrested or dismissed in the days since Haniyeh's death, the New York Times reported on Saturday. \nThe paper said the organisation's intelligence agency had taken over the investigation. Staff members at Haniyeh's guesthouse have been interrogated and their phones and other electronics have been seized, it added. \nMeanwhile, the security details of Iranian politicians have been overhauled. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh on Thursday, but was whisked away soon after the ceremony by his security detail. \nThe IRGC's statement on Saturday came after Britain's Daily Telegraph said Haniyeh was killed by bombs planted in his room by agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency \nCiting Iranian officials, the paper said two Mossad agents had entered the guesthouse and planted explosives in three rooms. The Iranians, who had viewed CCTV footage of the operatives, said the two subsequently left the country before detonating the bombs from outside Iran.\nThe New York Times also reported that Haniyeh was killed by explosives detonated in his room, saying they could have been planted up to two months earlier.  The BBC has not been able to verify these claims. \nBut Hamas officials told the BBC earlier this week that Haniyeh had stayed at the same guesthouse before. He had made up to 15 visits to Iran since becoming the head of the political bureau in 2017. \nThe papers' reports - if true - would represent an even bigger failure for the IRGC, who have long controlled internal security in the country. Experts also said it would highlight the degree to which Mossad can operate with impunity in Iran. \nRegardless of the manner of Haniyeh's death, both Iran and Hamas have vowed to retaliate. \nThe IRGC said on Saturday that Israel would receive \"a severe punishment at the appropriate time, place and manner\".\nHezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group in Lebanon, has also vowed reprisals. One of their top commanders, Fuad Shukr, was killed in an Israeli strike last Tuesday.\nAfter an Israeli operation killed IRGC Brig Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi in Damascus earlier this year, Iran fired 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and at least 110 ballistic missiles towards Israel. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israelis that \"challenging days lie ahead... We have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario\".\nHis ministers were sent home this weekend with satellite phones in case of an attack on the country's communication infrastructure. \nDespite the government's warnings, the mood appeared relaxed on Tel Aviv's seafront, with bronzed bodies lazing under beach umbrellas.\nBut few are in any doubt that the Middle East stands perilously close to full-scale war.\nIsrael is on high alert and several international airlines have suspended flights to the country.\nThe US has also deployed additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, the Pentagon said.\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has warned that the risk that \"the situation on the ground could deteriorate rapidly is rising\".\nMeanwhile, at least 10 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, the Hamas-run government media office has said. \nIt comes as Israel said an airstrike it conducted in the occupied West Bank killed a Hamas commander and four senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters on Saturday. \nThe Israeli military said the air strike hit a vehicle as the men were on the way to carry out an attack. \nElsewhere, Israeli officials - including the directors of Mossad and the internal security agency Shin Bet - have arrived in Cairo for fresh ceasefire talks. \nThey will meet Egyptian intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, and other senior military officials in a bid to rescue a potential truce. But US President Joe Biden admitted on Friday that Haniyeh's death had damaged the talks. \nHaniyeh was heavily involved in negotiations and Mr Biden said his death \u201cdoesn\u2019t help\u201d efforts to end the t",
    "The UK's unemployment rate has fallen slightly, official figures suggest.  \nUnemployment was 4.2% in the three months to the end of June, down from 4.4% over the previous quarter.\nMeanwhile, wage growth continued to slow, rising at an annual rate of 5.4% - the weakest for around two years, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested.\nIts director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown told the BBC's Today programme despite the positive news that unemployment had fallen, there were signs that the jobs market was \"cooling\" due to high numbers of vacancies, redundancies and those not actively seeking work.\nThe ONS has also urged caution about giving too much weight to its jobs figures at the moment.\nIts Labour Force Survey, which produces the data, has had a smaller number of respondents over the past year than normal.\nBut Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest numbers, which were an initial first estimate, showed there was \"more to do in supporting people into employment\".\n\u201cThis will be part of my Budget later in the year where I will be making difficult decisions on spending, welfare and tax to fix the foundations of our economy so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of our country better off.\"\nThe figures could pave the way for more interest rate cuts by the Bank of England this year.  \nIn a closely-run decision, policymakers cut the rate to 5% from 5.25% earlier this month - the first reduction for more than four years.   \nRates have been high as the Bank tries to control price rises across the economy.  \nBut this has also driven up the cost of borrowing for consumers and led to higher wages which, while good for workers, may have made businesses cut back on hiring. \nEstimated vacancies in the UK fell by 26,000 to 884,000 in the three months to July, the ONS says. \n\u201cFalling pay growth could help reassure the [Bank's] Monetary Policy Committee that domestic inflationary pressures are subsiding,\" said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK.\nHannah Slaughter, a senior economist with the Resolution Foundation think tank, said that the rise in people \u201cwho aren\u2019t working and aren\u2019t looking for work\u201d was worrying.\nShe said this was largely being driven by young people with long-term health conditions, particularly mental health problems.\n\u201cPeople in their early twenties are now more likely to be out of work due to sickness than people in their early forties, which is really worrying,\u201d she said.\nShe said the government could address this trend by improving healthcare provision, particularly mental health care.\n1.

    "Yorkshire Water has said it is \"disappointed\" at Ofwat's plans to fine the company \u00a347m over historic sewage spills.\nThe company is one of three firms facing sanctions from the industry regulator, alongside Thames Water and Northumbrian Water.\nAn investigation by Ofwat found that on average Yorkshire Water discharged untreated wastewater into the region's rivers for seven hours a day in 2023, with almost half of its storm overflows found to be in breach of regulations.\nA Yorkshire Water spokesperson said the firm took its \"responsibility to protect the environment very seriously\" and had previously apologised \"for not acting quickly enough\" as well as announcing a \u00a3180m plan to cut discharges from storm overflows by April 2025.\nOfwat's investigation, which began in 2021, looked into whether the three companies had been providing customers with the level of service they are entitled to under the law.\nIt found they had failed to adequately invest in and maintain their networks, leading to repeated releases of raw sewage into the country\u2019s waterways.\nIt added that Yorkshire Water had been slow to understand its obligations and was failing to put processes in place to comply with requirements.\nThe regulator's chief executive David Black said Ofwat had uncovered a \"catalogue of failures\" by all three water companies.\n\u201cOur investigation has shown how they routinely released sewage into our rivers and seas, rather than ensuring that this only happens in exceptional circumstances as the law intends,\" he said.\nResponding to Ofwat's investigation Yorkshire Water said: \"We and our customers care deeply about river health and we want to provide reassurance that we have already taken considerable action to improve.\n\"For the past two years we have been industry leading for our wastewater treatment works compliance, we have more robust processes and procedures in place, and we have finished work at 10 storm overflows with 44 on site, and 66 due to start soon as part of our \u00a3180m investment programme.\n\"Our business plan for 2025-2030, which is currently being reviewed by Ofwat, proposes our largest environmental investment of \u00a37.8bn.\u201d\nStorm overflows are used to allow excess waste water to escape into rivers or seas to avoid flooding, but are only designed to  be used  in exceptional circumstances.\nHowever, recent reports suggest water companies across England are using these \u201crelief points\u201d increasingly often.\nAt one such point at Langthorne Sewage Treatment Works, near Catterick, North Yorkshire, untreated wastewater spillages lasted an average of 20 hours in 2023. 259 spills were reported in 2023. \nAt Wentworth Sewage Treatment Works, less than five miles from RSPB Dearne Valley, wastewater spillages lasted an average of 19 hours. 198 spills were reported.\nAccording to the Environment Agency, there were 3.6 million hours of spills across England, compared to 1.75 million hours in 2022. In Yorkshire, there was 0.5 million hours of spills in 2023 \u2013 making up around 14% of the country\u2019s spills.\nClean water campaigners Surfers Against Sewage said the fines were a win for campaigners, who had been \u201cdemanding those in power enforce the letter of the law\u201d.\nChief executive Giles Bristow said: \u201cToday\u2019s fines illustrate the sheer state of disrepair of our broken water industry with nearly half of Yorkshire Waters storm overflows found to be in breach of their permits.\n\u201cPeople demand healthy rivers, lakes and seas and the government must ensure they, and the water sector, delivers it.\u201d\n",

Everyone is just devastated and taken aback.\"\nTyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service was forced to cut open the office's shutters because smoke could be seen billowing from the building.\nMost of the damage was concentrated on the front reception area, Ms Irving said. \nBroken glass was scattered throughout the building, which had also suffered smoke damage.\nThe team hope the office will be able to reopen later this week.\nStaff have managed to get the telephone lines up and running and they have a small presence at Sunderland City Hall to help people.\n\"We were obviously devastated when we saw it go up in flames but actually when I got here on Saturday I saw the true community spirit of Sunderland,\" Ms Irving said.\n\"People were out and about cleaning up, giving people support and making offers of help. \n\"For us it's all about getting back to where we were so we can be here to help the people who need us the most.\"\nFollow BBC Sunderland on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "For some Orcadians, taking a ferry can be more like tackling an assault course. That was certainly my experience as a blind person travelling between the islands.\nI went to Orkney after being contacted by people with disabilities who found it difficult to make journeys between the islands on the ageing fleet.\nLast year, the Scottish government agreed with Orkney Islands Council\u2019s request to look at the financial case to start replacing the inter-island ferries, which are vital lifelines for communities.\nBut there\u2019s a long and expensive journey ahead before new vessels might become a reality, so I wanted to experience firsthand the conditions on board.\nMy first trip was to Shapinsay - a short 30-minute journey from Orkney's capital, Kirkwall. I've been on many ferries over the years, but none was as challenging and hazardous as this.\nFirst I had to navigate the narrow spaces between the tightly-packed cars on the ferry. This would be difficult enough for anyone - and impossible for a wheelchair user.\nTrying to get through the door to reach the upper decks was my next hurdle. I had to step over an extremely high door threshold and, being unaware that I should duck simultaneously, banged my head against the top edge of the door.\nAfter this, I faced a very steep staircase which was more like a ladder than a stairway. Climbing up was a challenge, even for someone relatively mobile, and coming down was even more tricky. Fortunately for me, Daniel, my producer, went ahead to break my fall should the worst happen.\nWhile my main focus was on accessibility for people with disabilities, it quickly became apparent that these ferries present challenges for everyone - especially parents with young children and any older people with mobility issues.\nThe staff were excellent and did their best to help, but were extremely aware of the problems. One employee, who preferred to remain anonymous, told me: \"It's embarrassing for us. We know how difficult it is for passengers, and it's equally difficult for us to help them, given the age and condition of the fleet.\"\nOn my second day, I went to Westray to meet a couple of disabled residents to hear their experiences.\nThis ferry trip was longer, but the vessel was no more accessible and I suffered yet another glancing blow as I climbed to the passenger seating area.\nOn Westray I met Edith Costie, who used to be a care worker on the island before becoming disabled herself.\nShe said it was extremely tough to get people with disabilities to appointments in Kirkwall using the ferry service.\n\"Over 30 years ago, these boats arrived, and they were fit for purpose then - but now they're old and not disabled-friendly,\" she said.\n\"The crew is great, but the boats themselves are difficult.\n\u201cThere have been times when the ferries were so packed I couldn't physically get out of the car. I had to honk the horn until someone came to help.\"\nAny ferry built before 1995, like those on the inter-island Orkney service, is not legally obliged to be accessible for disabled passengers.\nThat all changed under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the subsequent Equality Act 2010. As a result, all ferries built since then have to be accessible.\nHowever, operators say it would not be cost-effective to retrofit ferries built before then to bring them up to standard.\nMyra Kent and her daughter Anne, who has multiple sclerosis, also live on Westray.\nAnne is a wheelchair user; she has no movement. She can speak and see, but that's all. It makes ferry trips exceedingly difficult, and you have to plan many days in advance.\nThey explained: \"You have to stay in the vehicle for the hour and a half journey. In summer it's not so bad, but in winter, unless you have hot water bottles and blankets, it's very cold by the time you get to the town.\"\nWhen I asked Anne if it would be better for someone with her complicated needs to live closer to Kirkwall, both she and Myra said: \"No. It would be hard to leave the island. Westray is our home.\"\nAnne needs to go to hospital eight times a year, so they have to plan around the ferry schedules. \"It's not the ferry crew's fault,\" they emphasised, \"but it can be hard.\"\nAs I headed back to Kirkwall from Westray, I could hardly believe my luck \u2013 no minor concussions, scratches, or bruises this time.\nThere's no doubt that these ferries are outdated and unsuitable for the 21st Century. The big question remains: where will the money come from to replace them, and how long will it take?\nOrkney Islands Council, the smallest local authority in Scotland, would be responsible for funding the replacement of the fleet. Nine ferries, built between 1987 and 1996, need to be replaced.\nDoing that, and upgrading the necessary infrastructure, would cost hundreds of millions of pounds - money which the council says it simply cannot afford.\nThe council\u2019s total annual budget is about \u00a3100m, which covers all its services like education, social care and waste management.\nCouncil leader Heather Woodb",
    "Police have been given a second time extension to question a man who was arrested on suspicion of murdering a dog walker.  \nAnita Rose, 57, had been with her pet close to Rectory Lane in Brantham, Suffolk on Wednesday, 24 July before she was found unconscious with serious head injuries.\nShe died in hospital on Sunday and a man in his 20s was arrested on Wednesday, 31 July on suspicion of murder.\nDetectives were previously given an extra 12 hours to question him but applied for a warrant granting them an additional 36 hours.\n\nThe warrant of further detention, which was applied for on Thursday afternoon at Ipswich Magistrates' Court, expires on Saturday morning. \nIt comes after one-week anniversary checks were conducted in the village on Wednesday. \nPreviously, a 45-year-old man was questioned on suspicion of murder while a 37-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods.\nThey were both released on bail with conditions to return to police in October. \nOfficers believe Ms Rose left her house at 05:00 BST to take her springer spaniel, Bruce, on their usual walk in the area.\nA member of the public then found her at 06:25 on a track road close to a railway line with her dog still by her side. \nShe was unconscious and found to have serious head injuries before the police arrived shortly after 08:00 and a cordon was set up.\nMs Rose was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where she died four days later.\nA Home Office port-mortem examination was carried out on Monday but was unable to establish a cause of death.\nPolice said further tests would be carried out.\nInvestigators are working to find a missing pink zip-up jacket Ms Rose was wearing prior to the incident. \nDet Supt Mike Brown said it \"could hold key information or evidence\".\nThe force has been handing out hundreds of leaflets about the investigation to appeal to anyone with information to come forward.\nOfficers were also on trains appealing to passengers who may have seen something as they passed through Brantham, which is on the London-Norwich main line.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "When Team GB's Kyle Kothari reflects back on the journey to his first ever Olympic Games, he feels proud.\nThe 26-year-old is preparing to go for glory in the men's 10m platform dive, the same event in which Tom Daley won bronze in Tokyo. \nBut, in many ways, being in Paris at all makes him feel like he's already won.\nAfter medals in lower-profile events, Kyle faced the possibility of career-ending operations, first in 2019 for a ruptured left achilles, and then the same injury on the other foot in 2021 - six months before the last Games in Tokyo.\n\"At that point, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to come back,\" he tells BBC Asian Network.\nKyle says he started exploring life outside of sport, even working at JP Morgan as an analyst for seven months.\nBut receiving an offer to work full-time made him realise he couldn\u2019t leave the sport just yet.\n\"Especially when I knew if I could stay injury-free, I knew how good I could be. \n\"If I didn't give it a go, I'd be cheating myself later down the line.\"\nGrowing up, Kyle, who is British Asian, says he was actually into gymnastics as a kid.\nBut he says he \"loved\" weekly diving sessions so much he chose the water as his future path.\nAccording to data compiled by Sport England, about 95% of black adults and 93% of Asian adults in the UK do not swim, with South Asians among the groups least likely to be active.\n\"Being a British Asian in sport is already quite rare,\" Kyle says.\n\"Especially when you get into the higher levels.\"\nHe describes gymnastics as feeling \"more diverse\", but aquatic sports like diving and swimming \"were not diverse at all\".\n\"You sometimes need someone to do it, for you to believe that it's possible,\" he says.\nThat message - and sense of responsibility - hit home for him earlier this year, at the World Championships in Doha.\nSpeaking with the Indian diving team, he says they were surprised someone with South Asian heritage, like Kyle, was so good at diving.\n\"The coach told me about how some of the kids didn't believe it was possible. Because there's not been Indians that have been in the top six in the world before.\n\"It was the first time I actually thought: Hang on, it\u2019s important to see someone that looks like you doing something.\n\"That makes you think that it's possible.\"\nBut Kyle also acknowledges his privilege in being able to follow his sporting dreams.\n\"Doing sport to this level requires such sacrifice. Not just financially but also from your family and support network,\" he says.\nKyle points to the help from his family growing up in pushing him to achieve big things.\n\"My parents really valued sport growing up, and that's quite rare in my community. My dad would have sold the house so that I could make an Olympics.\"\nThat support also aided his decision to leave \"a financially secure job\" at JP Morgan.\n\"How many people are able to just turn an opportunity like that down?\"\nNow, he says he is grateful for National Lottery funding, and hopes that sports in general can become better-paying, so it becomes a realistic career path for people from diverse backgrounds.\nAfter making the switch from synchronised diving to individual, Kyle says he's \"excited to compete, but equally nervous\", to be at one of the world's biggest sporting events.\nThe last person to win a medal for Team GB in the event was Tom Daley, someone he credits along with other members of the diving squad for their help.\n\"The entire team is filled with people that have multiple world medals, European medals, Commonwealth medals.\n\"We are just super-close mates. There's no egos, there's no chip on their shoulder.

    "\nThe Daily Mail uses its front page to call on Sir Keir Starmer to \"get a grip\" on what it calls \"work shy Britain\". It says official figures showing that the number of people who are economically inactive has climbed to a 12-year high are a \"major headache\" for the government. The paper highlights Conservative claims that plans to strengthen workers' rights will only make things worse. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has signalled she will announce further measures to help people back into employment when she unveils her budget. The Sun's editorial argues ministers will need to take a tough line on benefits. It questions whether Labour can \"brave the uproar\" if they cut welfare or impose new restrictions.\nThe Daily Telegraph suggests that the Ministry of Defence is facing deep cuts to its budget for modernising the armed forces. The paper says civil servants have been told to reduce research spending by 20%, putting hundreds of jobs at risk. Officials have called the figure \"incorrect\".\n\"Don't blame UK's finances for not fixing pension injustice\" is the headline in the Daily Express. Campaigners have told the paper that stretched government budgets are no excuse for denying compensation to women affected by changes to the state pension age. Tens of thousands argue they weren't adequately informed about plans to equalise their age of retirement with men. The government says it \"remains committed to ensuring historical errors are corrected\" and that \"pensioners get the financial support to which they are entitled\".\nThe Guardian highlights research that suggests cheaper food brands saw the biggest price rises during the cost of living crisis. According to the study, the cost of the least expensive groceries rose by more than a third in the two years to last September. Meanwhile the most expensive items went up by 16%. The article says the report, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, lays bare the disproportionate impact of rising food costs on the poorest households.\n\"Get ready to flee\" is the headline in the Daily Mirror. It leads on previously reported plans to get UK nationals out of Israel, should Iran launch an attack on the country. It says officials are investigating the possibility of putting on emergency flights if commercial jets are grounded.\nThe front pages of the i and the Financial Times both carry stories about Elon Musk's social media network X. The i alleges the website, formerly known as Twitter, has been running adverts for major brands alongside far-right posts. X hasn't responded to the article. The Financial Times says the European Union has accused its digital commissioner, Thierry Breton, of going rogue after he warned Mr Musk against spreading harmful content.\nSeveral papers highlight research that suggests living in Australia could extend your life. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, says people there survive 2 years longer on average than those in the UK.

He had a lot of qualifications and he was lucky enough to find another job,\" she said.\n\"She was definitely affected and that would have impacted on her studying for a while. \n\"But she was supported by teachers in school, and one in particular was very supportive because I think people are more than understanding about the situation with the steelworks because it's such a big part of people's lives.\"\nThe impact of the closure of Tata's blast furnaces in Port Talbot will be felt beyond the town.\nAt Neath college, Meagan Griffiths, 18, is awaiting her results in English language and literature, media studies, graphic design and the Welsh Baccalaureate. \nBut she said others who opted for the less academic route away from universities had considered an apprenticeship at Tata Steel as an option for the future, including her brother.\n\"It's a shame that such a good option is being taken away,\" she said.\n\"I think it will push people out of the area, especially if people look at other apprenticeships.\"\nMeagan is also a member of Neath Port Talbot's youth council, along with Maddie Pritchard, 18, who is a student at Ysgol Bro Dur in Ystalyfera.\n\"Everyone around here knows somebody who has been affected,\" Maddie added.\n\"There are a few members of the youth council whose parents work there, so we decided to do a sponsored walk to raise money for families who are going to be affected and we raised over \u00a3800 for them.\"\nA Tata Steel spokesperson said: \"We are incredibly proud of our multi-award-winning apprentice scheme, which derives its success from a mix of on-site experience, academy training, and strong partnerships with local colleges.\n\"At our other sites, we continue to recruit new apprentices and we certainly anticipate restarting the recruitment of new apprentices for our south Wales sites in the coming years as we bring on stream low-CO2 steelmaking, new technology and further investments across our Wales-based businesses.\"",

    "A dog owner has said she is \"depressed\" as she struggles to pay vet bills after \"maxing out\" her pet-insurance policy.\nMelanie Gassmann's 18-month-old chihuahua-cross has been having treatment since he was three months old, after being born with deformed legs, costing more than \u00a314,000.\nIt comes as a rescue charity says it is being \"hammered\" by vet bills.\nIn May, the Office for National Statistics estimated the cost of veterinary and other pet services had increased by around 50% since 2015, much higher than the overall rate of inflation.\nThe British Veterinary Association's president Dr Anna Judson said: \u201cVets provide highly specialised, tailored medical care for the UK\u2019s animals but with no NHS for pets and therefore no subsidies to offset the true cost, prices can seem costly in comparison.\"\nShe explained while costs had risen in recent years due to factors like inflation, advances in medical diagnostics and treatments and changes in pet owners\u2019 expectations added to the often unexpected costs.\nMs Gassmann, from Swindon, Wiltshire, felt a \u00a37,000-per-year insurance policy would be \"adequate\", but has now set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for Harry's treatments \"as a last resort\".\n\"I've been so depressed. I can just cry at the drop of the hat,\" she said, adding she was \"so grateful\" to those who had donated.\nLast year, Harry had an operation on both of his legs, which Ms Gassmann said used up the whole \u00a37,000 for the first year.\nThis January, just as the pet insurance renewed, he was admitted for dental surgery to remove puppy teeth that had not fallen out naturally, which was quoted at \u00a31,200.\n\"While he was under anaesthetic they phoned me and said his blood wasn't clotting.\n\"Thankfully they saved him,\" Ms Gassmann said, but he has since been on steroids and chemotherapy and needs more treatment, and the \u00a37,000 insurance pay-out is once again \"maxed out\".\nHarry has costly regular blood count checks, including an upcoming \"astronomically expensive blood test\" of \u00a3265, she explained.\n\"The dream is that he will go into remission... and he will live a happy life, \" Ms Gassmann added.\nMeanwhile, Bristol and Wales Cat Rescue has had to reduce the number of cats it takes in, \"in an effort to reduce costs\".\nTrustee Margaret Brittan said they were \"lucky\" to be registered with a private vet that is \"charity-minded\" and gives them discounted prices.\nShe said: \"We do use other vets as our foster homes are spread far and wide and the price differential is incredible.\"\nThe organisation can also no longer afford emergency out-of-hours care.\nMs Brittan added: \"Sadly that does sometimes impact on the care our cats receive as they then have to wait until the morning to see our routine vet.\n\"At a time when more are being surrendered and abandoned than ever before, it's not ideal but we have little choice if we want to survive.\"\nMs Brittan said: \"Insurance premiums have risen and we often get asked to take on cats because owners can't afford their vet bills.\n\"There really should be a standardisation of costs across all vets,\" she added.\nA petition set up by a pet owner calling for regulation to ensure fairer and more transparent vets bills has reached almost 130,000 signatures.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority is currently investigating the cost of veterinary services for household pets. It is due to publish its findings later this year.\nDr Judson added many pet owners now want to pursue treatment options for illnesses \"when in the past they may have instead chosen to have their pet euthanised\".\n\u201cWhilst fees reflect the investment needed to keep practices financially viable and open, we recognise more can be done to improve client choice.\"\nShe said the veterinary profession was \"actively looking at how we can be more transparent about both pricing and practice ownership, to ensure our clients can make an informed choice\". \nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Since the war began in Gaza following Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, its leaders have been targeted, allegedly by Israel. Some have been killed, others remain defiant.\nHere is a rundown of what has happened to Hamas's most prominent figures. \nIsmail Haniyeh was widely considered Hamas's overall leader. \nHe was assassinated, reportedly in an aerial strike, on a building he was staying in during a visit to Tehran on 31 July, 2024. Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for the strike.\nA prominent member of Hamas in the late 1980s, Israel imprisoned Haniyeh for three years in 1989 as it cracked down on the first Palestinian uprising.\nHe was then exiled in 1992 to a no-man's-land between Israel and Lebanon, along with a number of Hamas leaders.\nAfter a year he returned to Gaza. In 1997 he was appointed head of the office of Hamas's spiritual leader, strengthening his position.\nHaniyeh was appointed Palestinian prime minister in 2006 by President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas won the most seats in national elections. But he was dismissed a year later amid deadly violence in Gaza, with Hamas ultimately ousting Mr Abbas' Fatah party from the Gaza Strip.\nHaniyeh rejected his sacking as \"unconstitutional\", and Hamas continued to rule in Gaza.\nHe was elected head of Hamas's all-powerful political bureau in 2017, making him in effect overall leader.\nIn 2018, the US Department of State designated Haniyeh a terrorist. He had lived in Qatar for the last several years.\nYahya Sinwar is the leader of the Hamas movement within the Gaza Strip. Israel believes he masterminded the unprecedented attack on 7 October 2023.\nSinwar was born in Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza in 1962.\nA year after Hamas was founded in 1987, he formed its internal security service, which amongst other things targeted alleged Palestinian collaborators with Israel.\nSinwar was arrested by Israel three times. He was sentenced to four life terms in 1988 for planning the abduction and murder of two Israeli soldiers and the murder of four Palestinians.\nHowever, in 2011 he was among 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners released by Israel in exchange for an Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas for over five years.\nSinwar returned to his position as a prominent leader in Hamas and was appointed head of the group's political bureau in the Gaza Strip in 2017, making him Hamas's leader in the territory.\nIn 2015, the US included Sinwar on its blacklist of \"international terrorists\".\nSinwar has not been seen since the start of the war with Israel in October.  He is believed to still be in Gaza, hiding \u201c10 storeys underground\u201d, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.\nMohammed Deif was the head of Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement. He was Israel's most wanted man for decades, and was killed in an Israeli air strike last month, Israel says. Hamas has not confirmed this.\nDeif, a shadowy figure, became known to Palestinians as The Mastermind, and to Israelis as The Cat with Nine Lives.\nIsraeli authorities imprisoned him in 1989 during the first Palestinian intifada (uprising), and released him after a year and half. Soon afterwards he formed the al-Qassam Brigades, with the aim of capturing Israeli soldiers.\nHe also helped engineer the construction of tunnels that enabled Hamas fighters to get inside Israel from Gaza.\nDeif was accused by Israel of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s. He was arrested by the Palestinian Authority in 2000, but escaped seven months later at the beginning of the second intifada.\nHe became Israel's most wanted man, but since then left behind little trace. \nThe most serious assassination attempts on his life were in 2002: Deif survived but lost one of his eyes. Israel says he also lost a foot and a hand, and was left with difficulty speaking.\nIsrael tried and failed again to assassinate Deif during a 2014 assault on the Gaza Strip, but killed his wife and two of his children.\nDeif was one of the figures accused of planning the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October, 2023. Israel said it killed him in an air strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area of Gaza on 13 July. \nHamas has not confirmed that Marwan Issa, deputy commander-in-chief of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, was killed in an Israeli air strike in March 2024, as reported by the White House.\nUS national security adviser Jake Sullivan said he had been killed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), following reports in Israeli media that he had died in a strike on a tunnel complex under the Nuseirat refugee camp.\nThe senior commander is also known as the Shadow Man and has been viewed as Mohammed Deif's right-hand man.\nPrior to reports of his death, he was on Israel's most wanted list, and was injured when Israel attempted to assassinate him in 2006.\nIsraeli forces detained him during the first ",
    "A woman has said being unable to have her dream wedding as a result of her disability is \"really upsetting\". \nDue to transport issues, Sarah Tunnicliffe, 41, may have to travel 40 minutes in her wheelchair to her big day on 30 August, wearing her dress, or use a public bus.\nShe said the lack of availability of accessible wedding cars and the cost of renting wheelchair friendly vehicles meant she was stuck. \nSarah was diagnosed with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, a progressive muscle disease, when she was 16, and lost the ability to walk in her late 30s.\n\u201cIt's sad. It's disappointing. It's just mentally exhausting\u2026 constant problem solving all the time,\u201d said Sarah, from Cardiff.\nAfter her diagnosis, she said her main goal, at just 16, was to get married before she was no longer able to walk.\n\"It was really important to me\u2026 as time went on I thought \u2018well this is going to get harder and harder\u2019,\" she said.\nIn her early 30s, when a number of falls and broken bones meant she had to purchase her first wheelchair, she ruled out ever tying the knot.\n\"I said \u2018that's it, I'm not getting married now\u2019,\" she said.\n\"I've had all these dreams about the big white flowy dress, walking down the aisle arm in arm with my father\u2026 I was adamant.\"\nHowever, after a proposal from her fiance Jamie two years ago, she had a change of heart, but has encountered several problems since.\nAs for transport to her wedding, Sarah said the two best options for her - with her wedding only a month away - is travelling the 40-minute journey in her chair and wedding dress \u2013 or taking a public bus.\n\"Several ideas have been floated about how I could get there - but the legalities of traveling down Newport Road (in Cardiff to the venue) on the back of a tractor trailer I think are questionable,\" she joked. \nHer initial plan was to drive herself in her own accessible vehicle, although she had to sell it a few years ago for financial reasons.\nBut she said she has found next to no accessible wedding vehicles, with her only option renting a general accessible vehicle for a minimum of three days for about \u00a3600 - for just the 10-minute drive. \n\u201cThere's just been so many times where I've been let down [with previous rentals]\u2026 I just don't want that disappointment on my wedding day,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI'd rather either go on my chair, but everyone says 'you can't do that'\u2026 or the bus, it's about 14 minutes so it\u2019s not that bad.\"\nSarah has considered getting a taxi to her wedding, but due to the size of her wheelchair, has to partially dismantle it, against the advice of her doctors, to just about fit in them \u2013 and that\u2019s without a wedding dress.\n\u201cI got stuck in the taxi at my sister's wedding. I was a bridesmaid\u2026 they had to lift me out,\u201d she said.\nSarah said these are problems that happen every day for wheelchair users, whether it's her attempting to get to a hospital appointment or taking her pet to the vet.\n\u201cI accept things on a day to day basis, things are challenging\u2026 [but] I thought the wedding day would be different,\u201d she said.\nShe said another thing she dreamed of was a child was going out with a group of friends to try on wedding dresses.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not going to happen for me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn some ways that is really upsetting\u2026 it was something that I always dreamed of.\u201d\nShe said a majority of bridal shops are either upstairs, have stairs or are quite small and \u201cboutiquey\u201d.\n\u201cMy chair is quite big and bulky, but equally, I can't stand anymore, so I can't \u2018step into a dress\u2019,\" she said. \n\u201cI know that planning a wedding is not supposed to be easy and plain sailing\u2026 but I'm so tired. It's so disheartening.\n\u201cThere's certain things that I've not done because I don't have the energy to spend in it, like getting a cake.\u201d\nHowever, despite the challenges, Sarah said she is certain she is going to have the \u201cmost amazing\u201d day.\nShe said after realising \u201cI can't have the dress, I'm not having the car\u201d, the main thing for her was the venue, which she secured in Cardiff\u2019s Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama.\n\u201cAt least it can be set in a beautiful place\u2026 I love dancing, so I've got my DJ, and I've got a venue, and I've got food,\" she said. \n\u201cI love [Jamie] to bits\u2026 and I just want to celebrate that with him and everybody else.\n\u201cNothing's gonna stop me.

    "The Edinburgh Fringe is where many young artists from Northern Ireland go to make their name.\nHowever, some local artists have said the rising costs around performing there is a huge constraint.\nThe festival, which runs until 26 August, is in its 77th year and will see almost 4,000 different shows taking place.\nLocal artists have told BBC News NI they hope the Edinburgh Festival Fringe will allow Northern Ireland to \"showcase its talent\".  \nHit shows like Baby Reindeer, Fleabag and Nanette all began life at the Fringe.\nUp-and-coming acts will be competing for attention from punters and promoters - and battling the festival's spiralling costs. \nThe price of accommodation in particular is said to have tripled since 2019.\nOne Northern Ireland comedian said the costs were \"disgusting\". \nJohn Meagher, who presents The Divil's Own on BBC Radio 4, said that the festival is \"not accessible\" for working-class performers. \nThe Newry comedian, who this year will be performing a solo stand-up show at the Fringe for the first time, believes that the costs associated with the Fringe, especially rent, mean that working-class artists such as himself struggle to take part. \nJohn noted that, in an attempt to save money, many of his colleagues share rooms with strangers during the festival. \n\"You have to be very privileged to do the full month,\" said Mr Meagher. \nThe Edinburgh Festival Fringe has been contacted for comment.\nNorthern Ireland playwrights Orla Graham and Kirby Thompson have encountered similar financial challenges. \n\"The financial barriers you face are insane\", said Kirby, who is participating at the Fringe for the first time. \n\"It's so hard and it's so expensive,\" she added.\nOrla, meanwhile, cited what she described as the \"shocking\" funding situation of the arts in Northern Ireland. \n\"It's very tough when you do the budget, and you look at it and it's a shoestring budget. \n\"And you think 'how are we gonna do this?'\"\nVittorio Angelone, who was previously nominated for the Fringe's Best Newcomer Award in 2022, told BBC News that he was \"extremely blessed\" that he is able to afford to perform at the Fringe, thanks in no small part to his aunt and uncle in Edinburgh accommodating him during the Festival.  \n\"I know people who sold out their show and walked away owing two grand,\" said Vittorio. \n\"It can be exclusionary,\" he added. \nThe Belfast comedian highlighted that many performers have day jobs which they continue to work at remotely during the Festival, with this potentially impacting their performance. \nDespite the economic barriers, John, Orla, and Kirby all maintain that the cost is worth it. \n\"I grew up on a council estate,\" said John. \n\"I never went to university. I saved all year, this is the money I'd have spent on a degree. \n\"I'm investing in myself,\" he added.\nFor John, stand-up comedy has been a life-long dream. \nGrowing up in a house with two blind older brothers, stand-up offered a form of entertainment that was accessible to the entire household.\nJohn's stand-up show, Big Year, runs until 26 August at the Gilded Balloon Patter House. \nFor Orla and Kirby, the Fringe is an opportunity to introduce their play to a wider audience. \nFloat is about a group of young women living together in Belfast, and how they deal with the aftermath of sexual assault. \n\"We asked ourselves 'what makes us angry?'\", said Kirby. \n\"We kept coming back to being a woman trying to exist, and there's all these different things stopping you from living that chaotic experience of just being a girl in your twenties living with your mates.\"\nOrla, meanwhile, hopes that the play will \"prompt people to talk about things they would never talk about, or would be too afraid to discuss\". \nOrla and Kirby's play, Float, started on 1 August at the Assembly Roxy. \nVittorio, however, suggested that performing at the Fringe may be losing some significance for comedians. \n\"It's not the star-maker it once was\", says the Belfast man. \n\"The internet doesn't rely on gatekeepers. That's the way forward,\" he added. \nVittorio's stand-up show, Off the Cuff, runs from 2 August at the Monkey Barrel Comedy. ",
    "Social media is accused - by technology experts, academics and police - of fanning the flames of the recent disorder seen across the UK. \nBBC North East Investigations has seen far-right groups online that organised protests in the region at short notice and incited violence against Muslims.\nCalls to burn mosques and murder black and Asian people were just some of the content seen on a far-right group on the Telegram app set up after the murders of three girls in Southport last month.\nThe app said it was \"actively monitoring\" the channels.\nAnother post was shared, containing a list of locations, including Middlesbrough, for \"peaceful events\". But, if you scrolled to the bottom, it read \"time for war, lads\", followed by nine flame emojis.\nThe protest at Middlesbrough turned ugly, with some of the violence and riots live-streamed on social media apps for thousands to watch.\nAccording to Chris Stokel-Walker, a technology journalist and lecturer from Gateshead, \"this is unprecedented\".\nVideos of a Citizens Advice office on fire next door to a police station in Sunderland were also shared online during and following violence in the city.\nThere have been numerous videos of cars set alight and police vehicles smashed up.\n\"The fact that everybody is putting this onto TikTok and other social media platforms, and they seem so shameless, I think is unprecedented,\" Mr Stokel-Walker said.\nTikTok has been approached for comment. \nA teenager accused of live-streaming violence in Darlington this week was charged with violent disorder and remanded in custody until his next court appearance.\nAddresses of immigration services in Newcastle and Middlesbrough were also shared on another Telegram group we monitored.\nIt is not known if this was an intentional ploy to mislead the police, but the right-wing protests apparently planned in towns and cities across the UK did not materialise.\nAfter days of heightened fear and anxiety, thousands of counter protesters filled the streets instead.\nA spokesperson for Telegram said its moderators were \"actively monitoring the situation and are removing channels and posts containing calls to violence\".\n\"Calls to violence are explicitly forbidden by Telegram's terms of service,\" a spokesperson said.\nMisinformation online has also \"accelerated\" some of the anger, Mr Stokel-Walker said.\nHours after the murders of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, in Southport on 29 July, fake news about the attacker began to circulate on platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter.\nAnd, as the misinformation spread, so did the increased levels of anger.\nIt was falsely claimed the alleged killer had arrived in the country on a dinghy in 2023. Others posted that he was a Muslim, and a fake name also circulated.\nMerseyside Police later confirmed he was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents and had no known links to Islam.\n\"The whole reason these riots are happening is because of misinformation,\" Mr Stokel-Walker believes.\n\"The misidentifying of the alleged suspect, and this kind of idea this had some kind of racial element, gets baked into the discussion.\n\"It was completely and utterly untrue.\"\nX did not respond to the BBC\u2019s request for a comment. \nThe BBC\u2019s North East Investigations unit has been monitoring social media platforms following the Southport attack and found further examples of misinformation being shared.\nFar right activist Tommy Robinson shared inaccurate information to his 900,000 followers on X stating the \"lad who organised Middlesbrough march been locked up on terrorism charges\".\nHe was sharing someone else\u2019s post, so it is not clear if he believed the information to be true.\nCleveland Police later said it \"had not arrested anyone in connection with terrorism offences\".\nBut the rumour had already circulated online and was used to encourage violence against the police in Middlesbrough in a further Facebook post.\n\"Key social media figures, prominent influencers, politicians and right-wing journalists undoubtedly fanned the flames,\" Dr Bethany Usher, a social media and crime expert at Newcastle University, said.\n\"You just have to look at some of the comments underneath those posts and see some of the things people were saying to see how that incitement worked.\"\nCleveland Police Chief Constable Mark Webster said the people involved in riots in Hartlepool and Middlesbrough had been \"whipped up\" by others on social media. \n\"They've been really heavily influenced by what they read online,\" he said. \nHe said there was clear evidence of how misinformation had made people afraid. \n\"We've seen people closing shops or staying inside their houses because of what they read on social media,\" he said.  \nFalse rumours of acid attacks in Middlesbrough and Newcastle were also shared on various platforms.\nCleveland Police were forced to confirm in a statement it had received no such reports.\nA post on social media over the past few days also suggested \"acid attacks are happening",
    "The former manager of a hotel where an elderly guest was scalded to death after his bathroom door could not be opened said the problem could have been fixed \"decades\" earlier.\nWallace Hunter died at the Pitlochry Hydro in 2019 after being trapped in the bath, while guests and emergency services tried to smash in the door.\nEfforts to help the 75-year-old from Eaglesham, East Renfrewshire, were hampered by the door opening outwards and being bolted from the inside.\nChristopher Stanton told a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) that replacement locks with a safety release would have only cost an estimated \u00a380 a room.\nMr Stanton, 56, general manager of the hotel for almost 25 years, accepted he was partly to blame for what had happened with the door.\nHe told Alloa Sheriff Court: \u201cI've got to take a percentage of the responsibility for that. \n\"If asked a direct question, could I have foreseen this was a problem? The answer has to be yes.\n\u201cBut I didn't, and nor did anybody else. I wish I had.\"\nMr Stanton said he was heartbroken over Mr Hunter's death.\nHe said: \u201cI just shudder at the reality that came about that morning because of something that could have been dealt with sooner \u2013 20 years, 30 years before.\"\nHe said all bathrooms at the hotel with outward-opening doors had now had their locks removed completely.\nThe inquiry heard that a Health and Safety Executive investigation found that the mixer tap in Mr and Mrs Hunter's bathroom was more than 30 years old.\nIts temperature control was \u201cvery sensitive\u201d, and it did not satisfactorily isolate the hot water when the cold water shut off.\nMr Stanton admitted that old-style shower and bath taps which were then still in use in 11 rooms at the 73-bedroom hotel hotel \u2013 including Mr and Mrs Hunter's \u2013 were \u201cconfusing and complicated\u201d.\nThe inquiry heard that 19 complaints about the controls, high temperatures, \u201cboiling hot\u201d showers or lack of cold water, were recorded in the hotel maintenance log in the nine months leading up to Mr Hunter's death.\nThe temperature control on the shower in Mr and Mrs Hunter's room was logged as \u201ciffy\u201d and the shower reported as \u201ctoo hot\u201d only weeks before the tragedy.\nMr Stanton said: \u201cCustomers would come down and say they were struggling with it. We'd go up and show them, if we had time.\n\u201cMy feelings were that the vast majority of the time they just didn't know how to work them but I do accept that by the law of averages some of them did have genuine problems.\"\nMr Stanton said all the older-style taps were replaced last year.\nHe said: \u201cOver 20 years as manager we'd recorded maybe two or three scalds, minor ones, so I didn't think we had a problem with that.\u201d\nProcurator fiscal depute Gail Adair asked: \u201cSo the possibility of somebody receiving a fatal injury from scalding was not something that was in your mind?\u201d\nMr Stanton replied: \u201cI can look the family in the eye because I couldn't imagine that, in any scenario.\u201d\nThe company that owned the hotel has since gone into liquidation and it is now under new ownership.\nThe inquiry continues on Monday.",
    "A police and crime commissioner said she \"stands by\" her claim that arresting people for disorder is \"treating the symptom and not the cause\" of civil unrest, after her comment was criticised as \"divisive\".\nHampshire and Isle of Wight PCC Donna Jones made the remark when she appealed for calm on Saturday, as far-right demonstrations descended into riots in towns and cities.\nEastleigh MP Liz Jarvis accused Ms Jones of \"attempting to justify the criminality\", describing the PCC's earlier comments as \"divisive, inflammatory and grossly irresponsible\".\nIn a statement on Sunday, Ms Jones clarified her position on the protests, saying: \"The violence that has erupted across the UK this week has been criminal, unlawful and senseless.\"\nMs Jones, who is also chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), said: \"I stand by my statement issued yesterday where I called for calm, and for the country to work together stop this mindless, criminal behaviour.\"\nShe said she fully supported the police response to \"stem the growth of these riots\", adding: \"Those acting outside of the law should expect to feel the full force of it.\n\u201cThe violence we have seen has endangered our communities and infected lawful protest on a much broader issue.\n\u201cAs a country this issue is something we should seek to understand without letting it divide us.\"\nNazir Afzal, former chief executive of the APCC, has also criticised Ms Jones' earlier comments, calling them \"totally unacceptable\".\n\u201cI would have heavily advised against a current PCC, let alone the chair, appearing to justify rioting and criminality that police officers are bravely having to deal with right now,\" he said.\nOn Saturday, Ms Jones had said: \"The commonality amongst the protest groups appears to be focused on three key areas - the desire to protect Britain\u2019s sovereignty, the need to uphold British values and, in order to do this, stop illegal immigration.\"\n\"The government must acknowledge what is causing this civil unrest in order to prevent it. \n\"Arresting people, or creating violent disorder units, is treating the symptom and not the cause.\"\nShe also said government plans for cooperation between police forces had led to \"an accusation of two-tier policing, which has enflamed protestors\".\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said on Saturday: \"Anyone who gets involved in criminal disorder, violent thuggery on our streets, will have to pay the price.\"\nShe warned those involved in the disorder to \"expect there to be arrests, prosecutions, penalties and the full force of the law\".\n\"It's really important that communities can feel safe on the streets and their are consequences for breaking the law,\" she said.\nWinchester MP Danny Chambers also criticised Ms Jones, saying he was \"deeply concerned\" she believed \"rioters vandalising our streets and attacking mosques are motivated by 'the need to uphold British values'.\"\n\"These extreme views make her totally unsuitable to hold this position of responsibility,\" he said.\nBut Police Federation Chair Zoe Wakefield praised Ms Jones, saying she \"understands policing\".\nShe said the \"decimation of policing by the government\" had left police officers exhausted as forces struggled to cope with the wave of unrest.\n\"The only way to police these protests is by cancelling rest days and annual leave,\" she said.\nTensions have been high since the killing of three young girls in Southport, Merseyside, on Monday.\nMs Jones described the behaviour of some protesters as \"extremely violent, highly distressing and absolutely criminal\".\n\"Police officers have been injured, buildings have been targeted because of those living in them or worshiping at them and police cars and vans set on fire,\" she said.\nA protest in Aldershot on Wednesday descended into disorder but a separate gathering in Portsmouth on Saturday passed without any arrests.\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, who was born in Cardiff, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court earlier this week and was charged with murdering the three girls.\nHe was also charged with 10 counts of attempted murder after eight other children and two adults were seriously injured in the attack.\nHe was remanded into youth detention accommodation.\nResponding to the subsequent unrest, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced a programme to clamp down on violent groups by allowing forces to share intelligence.\nHe said: \"These thugs are mobile, they move from community to community, and we must have a police response that can do the same.\"\nFollow BBC South on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Twitter, or\u00a0Instagram.

    "An east London council has been told to \u201ccough up\u201d funds by its neighbour across the river for repairs to a foot tunnel linking the two boroughs.\nGreenwich Council says the northern lift of the Woolwich foot tunnel has been out of service since August 2022 due to a disagreement over money with Newham Council.\nThe tunnel crosses under the River Thames from Old Woolwich in the borough of Greenwich to North Woolwich in the borough of Newham.\nGreenwich Labour councillor Averil Lekau, cabinet member for transport, said she had expected the tunnel\u2019s north lift to be repaired in June this year.\nAt a transport and place scrutiny meeting last week, she said the repairs had been put on hold due to Newham Council\u2019s delay in agreeing to finance the works.\nThe two boroughs have equal financial responsibility for the tunnel.\nMs Lekau said the cabinet for Greenwich Council had agreed to a \u00a3180,000 contribution on lift repairs and \u00a365,000 on safety improvements.\nShe said: \u201cWe need Newham to agree to cough up a similar amount, that would be half of what is needed to put it up to speed. Whilst we are the authority that is responsible for doing the work, the financial responsibility lies on both authorities and we are making representations. We have been working to try and improve that.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIt is a bone of contention and it\u2019s very frustrating for me because this is something we\u2019ve actually said we\u2019re ready to put money in upfront.\u201d\nA Newham Council spokesperson said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Ms Lekau\u2019s remarks and felt they did not fairly represent the situation.\nThey added that Newham Council had consistently made it clear to Greenwich Council that it would honour the \u00a3126,000 of annual maintenance costs needed for the tunnel.\nThe spokesperson said: \u201cHowever, like many local authorities, Newham is being forced to closely review any additional capital investments, due to its current financial situation. \n\"We have repeatedly requested an urgent meeting with officials from Greenwich, which have only just been accepted, where we hope to find a mutual way forward.\u201d\nThe tunnel was built by London County Council and opened in October 1912. \nIt is open 24 hours day, seven days a week and is used by an estimated 300,000 pedestrians and cyclists each year.\nBoth the north and south entrances are Grade II-listed buildings.\nGreenwich Council has said that the lifts in the tunnel are vulnerable to unpredictable faults due to their age, with the most common cause of breakdown being doors failing to close as a result of objects being in the way or people forcing them open.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Three mates who hatched a plan to make fruit more widely available, while having a drink down the pub, are on the verge of receiving royal recognition.\nCharity Freely Fruity has been going for just over three years. Its aim is to plant fruit trees in parks and other public open spaces, up and down the country, so people have easy access to fruit at no cost.\nFriends Ryan Simpson, James Whittingham and Matt Knight said they originally planned to do a spot of guerrilla gardening. \nBut, during the first Covid-19 lockdown, the idea transformed into growing fruit and vegetables on some land near Mr Whittingham's house, beside the M4 in Berkshire.\nThey have gone on to plant several orchards, the most recent one on a recreation ground close to the Whitley estate in Reading, where comedian Ricky Gervais grew up.\nThe charity was nominated for the first ever round of the King\u2019s Award for Voluntary Service. \nThe scheme was only set up in 2022, with the then Queen\u2019s Awards being presented last year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the highest award you can get as a charity, the equivalent of an MBE, but for an organisation rather than a person,\u201d said Mr Knight.\nRoyal recognition would also raise the organisation\u2019s profile and the three founders believe it could help them take their work much further afield.\nMr Simpson said: \u201cFor three men to start this dream up in a pub, over a few beers, to where this charity has come to today, it\u2019s crazy and mind-boggling. The world literally is our orchard,\u201d he added, echoing the charity\u2019s slogan.\nAs part of the award, two representatives of the successful nominated charities get an invitation \u2013 appropriately enough if Freely Fruity win \u2013 to a royal garden party.\nMr Whittingham believes there would be plenty to talk about with King Charles, given their shared love of gardening and the environment.\n\u201cI think from what he\u2019s done in the past and the visions of the future and a greener planet, I think he would get us and it would be great to have that chat with him,\u201d he said.\nAll 14 groups who have been nominated from Berkshire will be honoured by the county\u2019s lord-lieutenant at a special ceremony in Wokingham later this month. \nThe winners will be announced on the King\u2019s birthday in November. \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Eight men have been sentenced over their involvement in violent disorder after trouble flared at a hotel housing asylum seekers.\nViolence broke out outside the Suites Hotel in Knowsley, Merseyside, last year which was providing temporary accommodation for asylum seekers.\nA large group had gathered and rocks and fireworks were thrown at police.\nRingleader Brian McPadden, 61, of Kirkby, was jailed for three years and six months at Liverpool Crown Court.\nSentencing the men, His Honour Judge Watson KC said McPadden was the self-appointed front man who rallied and encouraged others for several hours at the protest.\nThere were gasps from the public gallery as he was jailed.\nThomas Mills, 47, who brought a banner to the protest urging people to shout to get the asylum seekers out, was sentenced to two years and eight months.\nPaul Lafferty, 42, was handed the same sentence while Jonjo O'Donoghue, 21, of Liverpool, was sentenced to three years and six months in a young offenders institution.\nFormer British Army soldier Liam Jones was sentenced to 27 months while John Tippler, 59, was jailed for two years.\nWarren Cullen, who was on a community order at the time of the protest, was jailed for 20 months.\nThe judge gave Harry Boynton a 16-month suspended sentence along with 200 hours of unpaid work. \nThe men had admitted being present on the night but denied violent disorder.\nA number of police vehicles were damaged, and a police carrier van was set alight, causing thousands of pounds of damage. \nPolice officers were injured during the disorder and one needed hospital treatment.\nThe court had heard there was \"ill feeling\" in the area following a video on social media which appeared to show an asylum seeker asking a 15-year-old girl for her phone number and for a kiss.\nSenior prosecutor David Jones said: \"This was not a peaceful protest as these men claimed. \n\"It descended into violence and hostility - most of it directed at the police who had to use all their protective gear to protect themselves and prevent violence spilling over into the hotel.\"\nHe added: \"The right to peaceful protest is enshrined in law - but this protest descended into criminality and those involved have now been brought to justice.\n\"The disorder on that night shocked many in the local community and it is important that residents are assured that behaviour like this will meet with the full force of the law.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "Mystery surrounds an American woman who was found chained to a tree \"screaming\" in a forest in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.\nLalita Kayi, 50, was discovered a week ago in the dense forests of Sindhudurg district after her cries for help were heard by shepherds. They alerted the police who sawed off the chain and rescued her.\nMs Kayi, who appeared completely emaciated, was taken to hospital. Her physical health has since improved and, on Friday, she was moved to a psychiatric facility for further treatment, doctors treating her told the BBC.\nIn a written statement to the police, she has alleged that her husband \"chained her and left her in the forest to die without food or water\".\nPolice say they are looking for her husband in the southern state of Tamil Nadu on the basis of information she provided them.\nBut seven days after Ms Kayi was rescued, many questions remain unanswered.\nPandurang Gawkar, a cow herder who found her last Saturday, told BBC Marathi that he had taken his cattle to graze in the forest when he heard \"a woman screaming loudly\". \n\"The sound was coming from the forest on the side of the mountain. When I went there, I saw that one of her legs was tied to a tree. She was screaming like an animal. I called other villagers and the local police.\"\nPolice said that on her they found a copy of her passport, which stated that she was an American citizen, and her Aadhaar card - a unique ID for Indians - with her home address in Tamil Nadu.\nThey said she also had a mobile phone, a tablet and 31,000 rupees ($370; \u00a3290) in her possession - which allowed them to rule out theft as a motive.\nLocals say that it was the woman's good fortune that the shepherd picked a spot near her to graze his flock that day. The forest she was discovered in is vast and she otherwise could have gone for days without anyone hearing her cries for help.\nPolice initially took her to a local hospital before moving her to a hospital in the neighbouring state of Goa.\nDr Shivanand Bandekar, dean of Goa Medical College, told The Indian Express newspaper that she had some wounds on her leg and that she appeared to be suffering from a mental health condition.\n\"We do not know for how long she did not eat, but her vital signs are stable,\" Dr Bandekar said.\nOn Friday, the woman's physical health had improved enough to be moved to a psychiatric hospital in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra state.\n\"Currently, her health is stable,\" hospital superintendent Dr Sanghamitra Phule told BBC Marathi.\n\"She is taking medication, eating, and interacting with people. If she wants something, she can communicate it. She only knows English.\"\nAccording to the police, Ms Kayi was a ballet dancer and yoga practitioner in America - some reports say specifically Massachusetts - and moved to India about 10 years ago to study yoga and meditation in Tamil Nadu. \nIt was there that she met her husband - in some media reports, police have called him Satish. Police say they believe at some point she fell out with her husband.\nSome reports say that she stayed in a hotel in Goa for two days and then travelled to Mumbai city, India's financial capital.\nBut there is no clarity surrounding when or how she then ended up in the forest where she was discovered last week.\nMs Kayi, who was initially unable to speak, communicated with the police and doctors by scribbling notes on a pad. Through them she blamed her husband for tying her to the tree and claimed that she had gone without food and water for 40 days.\nShe also claimed that she had been given an \"injection for extreme psychosis\" which locked her jaw and prevented her from drinking water, and that she had to be provided nutrition intravenously. \n\"I am a victim and survived.

    "US President Joe Biden met his senior national security team on Monday as concerns of a possible Iranian retaliatory attack on Israel grew.\nMr Biden said he had been briefed on preparations to support Israel should it be attacked, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken said officials were working \"around the clock\" to prevent an escalation. \nTensions have risen over the last week following the assassination of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh, for which Iran has blamed Israel and vowed \u201csevere\u201d retaliation. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the assassination.\nNumerous countries, including the US and UK, have also told their citizens to leave Lebanon, from where it is feared Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political movement, could play a role in any response. \n\nDuring Monday's briefing, Mr Biden was told the timing and nature of an Iranian attack remained unclear, according to US news site Axios. A day earlier, Mr Blinken reportedly told his G7 counterparts that Iran and Hezbollah could attack Israel within 24 to 48 hours.\nIn a statement released after the briefing, Mr Biden said: \"We received updates on threats posed by Iran and its proxies, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, and preparations to support Israel should it be attacked again.\" \nHe added that steps were being taken to respond to attacks on US forces \"in a manner and place of our choosing\". On Monday, several US personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack on a US military base in Iraq.\nSpeaking to reporters earlier in the day, Mr Blinken said officials were \"engaged in intense diplomacy pretty much around the clock with a very simple message: All parties must refrain from escalation\". \n\"Escalation is not in anyone's interests. It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity,\" he said.\nHe added that a ceasefire would \"unlock possibilities for more enduring calm not only in Gaza itself, but in other areas where the conflict can spread\". \n\"It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead,\" he said.\nEarlier in the day, Mr Biden spoke to King Abdullah II of Jordan about \"efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, including through an immediate ceasefire and hostage release deal\", a statement from the White House said.\nA joint statement from the G7 also expressed \"deep concern at the heightened level of tension in the Middle East which threatens to ignite a broader conflict in the region\". \n\"No country or nation stands to gain from a further escalation in the Middle East,\" it said.\nTalks that had brought renewed hope of a ceasefire deal to end the conflict in Gaza have faltered following the events of recent weeks. \nOn 27 July, 12 children and teenagers were killed in a strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel accused Hezbollah of carrying out the strike, though Hezbollah denied any involvement.\nDays later, Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah military commander, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a suburb of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. Four others, including two children, were also killed.\nHours later, Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran.\nIran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said Haniyeh was killed in a \"strong blast\" caused by a \"short-range projectile\" fired from outside a house where he was staying while visiting the capital, Tehran. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in an interview with Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that the killing would have a \"negative impact on the ongoing negotiations\".\nIsrael has not commented on the assassination, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said afterwards that Israel had delivered \u201ccrushing blows\u201d to Iran\u2019s proxy groups in recent days.\nFollowing the killings in Lebanon and Iran, the IRGC said Israel would receive a \"severe punishment at the appropriate time, place and manner\", while Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the conflict had entered a \"new phase\".\nIt is the closest the conflict has come to escalation since April, when Iran fired some 300 drones and missiles at Israel in response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria that killed a number of senior military commanders.\nOn Monday, Jordan asked all airlines planning to land at its airports to carry an additional 45 minutes' worth of fuel, a move thought to be a precaution in case Jordan has to close its airspace in the event of a regional conflict. \nGerman flag carrier Lufthansa has suspended all flights to Tel Aviv, Tehran, and Beirut until and including 12 August. \nUS airline Delta has also paused flights to Tel Aviv until at least 31 August \"due to ongoing conflict in the region\".\nThe UK Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to Lebanon and has urged British citizens in the country to leave.\nIt also advises against all travel to the northern area of Israel that shares a border with Lebanon. \nThe conflict in Gaza began following the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas and other militant group",
    "The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has condemned the scenes of violence and disorder on \"the streets of Belfast\" on Saturday.\nThe trouble happened after anti-immigration and anti-racism protesters faced off in tense scenes outside the city hall.\nPolice are treating damage to several businesses as hate crimes. \nResidents also had to leave an apartment block in south Belfast after it was set on fire. \nThe PSNI said four people have been arrested after 13 reports of criminal damage and five of arson.\nThree police officers were injured during the disorder - two remained on duty while the third was relieved from duty after suffering concussion.\nIn a statement, First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said: \"Whilst people are entitled to peaceful protest, there is no justification for racism or the violence and intimidation that occurred on Saturday.\n\"Those involved should be quickly brought before the courts and we appeal to anyone with information to provide that information to the PSNI.\n\"We reiterate our joint commitment to a shared, peaceful and inclusive society.\"\nAfter the protest outside the city hall some anti-immigration protesters had attempted to march to the Belfast Islamic Centre in south Belfast but were prevented by police.\nThe crowd then made their way to Botanic Avenue, University Street, Lower Ormeau, Holylands and Donegall Road areas where sporadic violence developed for a number of hours.\nDisorder also broke out in the Sandy Row area and several cars were set alight and a business premises targeted.\nAssistant Chief Constable Davy Beck said those who \"engaged in this behaviour bring nothing but shame to themselves and Belfast city\".\n\u201cThis disorder, violence and destruction has no place in Belfast or anywhere else across the streets of Northern Ireland,\" he said.\n\u201cI would strongly urge anyone who was involved in yesterday\u2019s rioting and disorder to think long and hard about their actions and the devastating impact this has had on local communities.\"\nA supermarket and a cafe in the Donegall Road and Sandy Row areas of south Belfast were also badly damaged by fire in overnight attacks.\nAbdelkader is the owner of the supermarket in the Donegall Road area that was targeted.\nHe said he had shut the shop on Saturday afternoon and was surprised to see images of it burning on social media later that night.\nHe said he was from Syria and had been living in Northern Ireland for eight years.\n\u201cEverything we built from zero is destroyed,\u201d he told BBC News NI.\n\u201cEverything is done, my life is done.\u201d\nHe said he did not have the financial means to rebuild the property.\nSam Yousef is a representative of the Syrian community in Belfast.\nHe says that members of the community are \u201cvery afraid\u201d and that he feels a bit unsafe as well.\nMr Yousef says that on social media he has seen people telling each other not to leave the house because the situation is \u201cvery terrible\u201d.\n\u201cThis is our country\u2026we are trying to pay back, trying to work hard, pay tax, integrate into the society and contribute to the people here,\" he said.\n\u201cOur children are growing up here and we want them to feel safe because we escaped an unsafe area.\"\nDaniel Lannon, who attends a nearby church, said he was driving past on Sunday morning when he saw the destruction caused by the attack on the supermarket.\nHe stopped to help with the clear-up.\n\u201cI believe this is the right thing to do,\u201d he added.\n\u201cSome of the stuff that was going out on social media, with the protesters saying they were doing this in the name of Christianity, but that\u2019s not Christianity.\n\u201cChristianity is to love your neighbour, to help them, to help those who are different from you, so that\u2019s what we are trying to do today.\u201d\nA cafe on Botanic Avenue was also attacked by a crowd of anti-immigration protesters on Saturday afternoon as they made their way to the Holylands area of south Belfast.\nProtesters threw missiles at members of the media.\nWindows were smashed and furniture was broken in the cafe on Botanic Avenue.\nRahmi, the owner of the cafe, who has been in Belfast for 35 years, told BBC News NI on Sunday that he \"could have been killed\".\nHe reiterated that there could have been more of a police presence when \"the parade was walking\" through the area.\n\u201cYou watch the videos and you can see only me and these big, massive chairs that they keep throwing at me.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure if I had left the door open, they would do more damage or burn the inside.\u201d\nOn Saturday, the police said it was aware of a number of reports of criminal damage and were treating them as hate crimes.\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in MLA for Belfast South, Deidre Hargey, said there are \u201cconcerns\u201d around the police \u201coperation that took place\u201d because she had warned the PSNI about possible demonstrations.\n\u201cWe will be robustly following that up with the PSNI because lessons need to be learned,\" she added.\n\u201cIt was clear that there was no proper policing in the Botanic area, in the university area, and",
    "A man who spent six figures buying and restoring a rare 1950s racing car has received an invite to take part in a prestigious motor show.\nIan Jones, 59, from Milton, Cambridgeshire, purchased the RA4 Vanguard racing car in 2021.\nMr Jones said the car was the only one of its kind in the world and, owning to its rarity, he has received an invitation from the Goodwood Revival festival to race in the Goodwood Trophy in September.\nThe vehicle was designed in 1930s Germany and was eventually built and raced in New Zealand in the 1950s.\n\"I bought the car in 2021 from an auction house in London,\" said Mr Jones. \"I hold a private pilot's licence and fly war planes out of Duxford Imperial War Museum, so was attracted to the car because it was largely constructed from Second World War aircraft parts.\n\"I thought it would need a quick engine tune up and polish, and it would be racing again, but I soon realised it was going to need a complete nut-and-bolt restoration from top to bottom.\"\nMr Jones used expert craftsmen on the three-year project from Cambridgeshire and Suffolk to rebuild the engine, chassis, panels and restore the leather interiors.\nDuring the latter half of the 1930s, Grand Prix racing was dominated by two German racing teams, Mercedes Benz and Auto Union. They were collectively referred to as \u201cThe Silver Arrows\u201d. \nThe Auto Union company originally designed the RA4 Vanguard, but it was never manufactured.\nThe car was eventually built from those designs in 1950 by two former Second World War aircraft mechanics, Hec Green and Jack Brewer in Christchurch, New Zealand. \nThe pair found plans for the vehicle in a declassified British intelligence paper, which studied the German racing programmes of the 1930s.\nDue to the lack of raw materials post-1945, Mr Green and Mr Brewer came up with a plan to utilise as many old Second World War aircraft parts as possible.\nThe RA4 Vanguard first appeared at the 1951 Lady Wigram International meeting held in Christchurch, New Zealand. Despite a lack of development, the RA4 performed well at many international and local meetings in New Zealand from 1951 through to 1960.\nIn the following years the car was abandoned, changing hands a number of times until purchased by Mr Jones in 2021.\nA spokesperson from the Goodwood Revival festival said: \u201cThe effort Mr Jones has gone to in order to bring the wonderful RA4 Vanguard back to life is fantastic, and the fact that it can join us to race at this year\u2019s Revival and add another chapter to its racing history all makes for a great story. \n\"It fits perfectly with the revive and thrive ethos at the heart of the Revival and we\u2019re fortunate that people like Mr Jones so willingly competes with these special machines still. \n\"This year, all competing vehicles at the Revival will race on sustainable fuel, adding another element to the car\u2019s story as the past very much meets the future of motor racing.\u201d\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has called on Huw Edwards to hand back the salary he earned from the BBC after being arrested on child abuse image charges.\nThe BBC continued to employ Edwards, formerly its most high-profile newsreader, for five months after he was arrested on three counts of making indecent images of children, during which time he was paid \u00a3200,000.\n\"I think he ought to return his salary,\" Ms Nandy told Sky News.\n\"I think having been arrested on such serious charges all the way back in November, to continue to receive that salary all the way through until he resigned is wrong and it's not a good use of taxpayers' money.\"\nShe added: \"I think most people in the country will agree with that but whether he does that or not is up to him.\"\nMs Nandy's comments came after she had talks with the BBC's director general Tim Davie about the corporation's handling of the episode, including the issue of Edwards' pay.\nMs Nandy told BBC News: \"We had a very robust and frank discussion about the circumstances around the case, and some of the decisions that have been made during that case and since.\n\"Obviously I am particularly concerned to make sure that people have confidence in the BBC.\"\nShe said Mr Davie had \"made a good start\" in being \"as open and transparent as possible\" about what the BBC knew and why he made the decisions he did.\nShe added: \"My concern is to make sure warning signs are caught, complaints are acted on, public money used well, and to make sure as far as humanly possible, we don\u2019t have a repeat of this situation in the future.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Ms Nandy said: \"There are questions, though, that many people have asked about whistleblowers for example.\" \nShe added that there were also \"questions about the contractual arrangements that the BBC has and whether it's appropriate if people are suspended, particularly once they've been arrested, to continue to receive not just full pay but also to see an uplift in that pay\".\nEdwards received between \u00a3475,000-\u00a3479,999 between April 2023 and April 2024, an increase of \u00a340,000 on the previous year. Mr Davie said the pay rise dated from before any allegations.\nEdwards was initially suspended by the BBC in July 2023 following allegations in the Sun newspaper.\nHe was then arrested in November on unrelated charges of making indecent images of children, but the arrest wasn't made public at the time.\nHe resigned this April, which the BBC said at the time was on \"medical advice\".\nEdwards was charged this June, but news of the charge was only revealed this week.\nOn Thursday, Conservative former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told the BBC's Newsnight there was \"an impression that the BBC has not sought to be as transparent as they should be\" over the whole matter.\n\"I think we need to know much more about why it was came to the conclusion that he [Edwards] should go on receiving his salary, that he should be allowed to resign rather than be sacked, and why the BBC knew about his arrest, and yet we only discover it eight months later,\" Mr Whittingdale said.\nThe Metropolitan Police told senior BBC managers about the arrest in \"strict confidence\" in November.\nAsked how much he was told at the time, Mr Davie said: \"We knew it was serious, we knew no specifics, apart from the category of the potential offences.\"\nBBC bosses were not aware of the ages of the children in the images.\nAsked why Edwards could not have been sacked at the time of his arrest, Mr Davie replied: \"Because the police came to us and said they need to do their work in total confidence, [and said], 'please keep this confidential'.\"\nEdwards had not been charged at that point and it was still possible he would be cleared, Mr Davie noted.\n\"We thought long and hard about this. This wasn\u2019t a kneejerk decision. When you think about this in terms of precedent, people do get arrested, and then we've had situations where [there are] no charges, and there's nothing there to be followed up on.\"\nThe BBC has said Edwards would have been dismissed had he been charged while still employed.\nMr Davie said the corporation also had to consider its duty of care to the former News at Ten presenter.\nThe director general also said it would be \"legally challenging\" for the BBC to recover any of the pay, but he would \"look at all options\".\nIt would be \"nigh on impossible\" for the BBC to claw back his pension, he told the BBC's David Sillito.\nIn court on Wednesday, Edwards admitted having 41 indecent images of children, which had been sent to him by a convicted paedophile, Alex Williams, on WhatsApp.\nThey included seven category A images, the most serious classification - two of which showed a child aged between about seven and nine.",
    "It had been the NHS\u2019s longest-running and bitterest pay dispute - responsible for hundreds of thousands of cancelled operations and appointments.\nAnd then, suddenly, word came on Monday that the British Medical Association was recommending that its 50,000 junior doctor members accept a fresh offer from the new government.\nIt sounded almost too good to be true. And now some are wondering if it might be.\nLast Friday, just three days after formal negotiations started at the Department of Health\u2019s London headquarters, Health Secretary Wes Streeting laid his cards on the table.\nIt was, he made clear to the British Medical Association delegation, a final offer - a pay rise topping 22% on average over two years in England.\nThe union\u2019s team said they wanted to think about it over the weekend. On Sunday, the BMA junior doctor leaders met and decided that, while it fell short of their demand for a 35% pay increase, this was the best deal they could get.\nCue much trumpeting from the government - in her appearance at the House of Commons, Chancellor Rachel Reeves paid tribute to work put in by the health secretary.\nMr Streeting had met the BMA joint junior doctor leaders Dr Rob Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi several times before the election - asking them in their last meeting on Zoom to call off the strike they were about to hold in the lead-up to polling day.\nWhen he was made health secretary, Mr Streeting immediately called the BMA to set up talks. Two meetings were held with Dr Laurenson and Dr Trivedi in a 10-day period following his appointment - before the formal pay talks started.\nThe health secretary\u2019s hand was helped by the fact the independent pay review body\u2019s recommendations for the 2024-25 pay rise had just landed on his desk, suggesting a 6% pay rise and \u00a31,000 lump sum be given.\nThis allowed him to make an offer which effectively combined two years of pay rises. He topped up last year\u2019s pay award - worth nearly 9% on average - with an extra 4% as well as agreeing to the pay review body\u2019s recommendation for the current financial year.\nIn less than a week of talks, the new health secretary had achieved what the previous government had failed to do over the course of 11 strikes in the previous 18 months.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is it could be presented as a win-win for both sides,\u201d one source close to the talks said.\n\u201cThe BMA got a big number, while the government only put in an extra 4% above what the pay review body recommended across the two years - that is just one percentage point more than what the Tories put on the table back in December when talks collapsed.\u201d\nDefending the deal, Ms Reeves called the costs - around \u00a3350m - a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d compared to the \u00a31.7bn cost of NHS strikes.\nThat may all be true, but what\u2019s on offer to junior doctors has not gone unnoticed elsewhere in the NHS.\nA pay rise of only 2% for NHS staff was budgeted for in the funding given to the health service this year.\nThe Treasury has indicated it will cover some of the extra, but perhaps not all. That has caused concern among senior managers running hospitals.\n\u201cUnless we get additional money to pay for this pay rise we will have to take money out of services and that is not right for the people that we serve,\u201d says Nick Hulme, the boss of Ipswich and Colchester Hospitals.\nThere\u2019s also frustration among other frontline staff who are having to make do with much less. Staff such as nurses, midwives, paramedics and physios have received a little more than half the rise junior doctors have won.\nThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has said it will now be consulting its members to see what they want to do - and industrial action is not being ruled out.\n\u201cWe do not begrudge doctors their pay rise,\u201d RCN leader Prof Nicola Ranger says. \u201cWhat we ask for is the same fair treatment from government.\u201d\nProf Len Shackleton, an economist at the University of Buckingham and research fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs, believes this could be just the start of a fresh round of pay demands.\n\u201cThe government is na\u00efve if it thinks this is over - other unions will look at this deal and think they can get more, not just those in the NHS but across the public sector. This could spiral out of control.\u201d\nOn Thursday GPs launched a work-to-rule over what they say is insufficient funding for general practice \u2013 although the ballot leading up to this was run before the junior doctor deal was announced.\nAnd already there are signs the junior doctors themselves will be back asking for more.\nIn WhatsApp messages leaked to the Times newspaper, Dr Laurenson said there would be another \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d in 12 months time for further strikes when the new government\u2019s honeymoon period is over.\nHe said he \u201cdesperately\u201d wanted to get more from ministers, but this was the best that could be achieved for now. When the story emerged, he took to X to say he had told Mr Streeting as much to his face during the talks.\nThe end of the NHS industrial disputes may not",
    "An Australian father-of-three was killed by a crocodile after falling into a river when a path gave way, his family have said. \nDr Dave Hogbin was on holiday in Queensland with his wife and three boys when a riverbank gave way and he fell into the Annan River in Cooktown.\nHis wife tried to pull him out of the water, but she too began slipping down the river bank, prompting him to let go of her arm. His family called him a \"hero\", hailing his \"final selfless act\".\nQueensland Police said they believed human remains found in a crocodile in Cooktown to be of a 40-year-old man, from New South Wales, who went missing on Saturday. The remains are yet to be formally identified. \nWriting for News.com.au, journalist Alexis Carey, sister-in-law of Dr Hogbin, said his family wanted to speak out to raise awareness over how dangerous the area is and so his children \"know exactly how amazing a man he really was\". \nThe GP, from Newcastle, New South Wales, had been on a camping holiday with his wife Jane and three sons - aged seven, five and two - when he was taken by a 4.9m (16ft) crocodile on Saturday afternoon, she wrote. \nClearing up an initial suggestion from police that he had been fishing, Ms Carey said    the family had been walking along a path on a 5m high (16ft) river bank when a portion of it gave way and he was unable to get out of the water. \nShe said his wife, also a GP, slid down to pull Dr Hogbin out and was able to grab his arm, but she also began slipping into the river herself. \n\"Dave\u2019s final, decisive act was to let go of Jane\u2019s arm when he realised she was falling in, despite knowing she was his only lifeline. Within moments, he was taken,\" Ms Carey said. \n\"Dave\u2019s brave decision in that terrifying moment very likely saved his wife\u2019s life, ensuring she was able to return to their boys.\"\nShe said the fact his children did not witness their dad's final moments was a \"small piece of consolation\". \nDr Hogbin's wife, Jane, said: \u201cWe were just enjoying a standard day of our holiday and everything just changed within 30 seconds. He wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong \u2013 in fact, he was doing everything right, and this still happened...\n\u201cHe saved me \u2013 his last act was to not pull me in with him.\"\nPaying tribute to her husband, she described him as a dedicated father and \"fiercely loyal and protective\". \nA GoFundMe page set up to help support the family has raised more than A$56,600 (\u00a328,880). \nQueensland Police said the remains found in the crocodile would be tested further to aid identification. \nA report for the coroner is being prepared and the search has been suspended. \nLast month, police found human remains while searching for a 12-year-old who they believe was the victim of a crocodile attack.\nIn April, a 16-year-old boy died in a suspected crocodile attack in Torres Strait waters while trying to swim ashore from a broken-down dinghy. \n\n",

    "Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Iran on Wednesday, has been buried in a muslim ceremony in Qatar.\nFuneral prayers were held at Qatar\u2019s Imam Muhammed bin Abdul Wahhab mosque - the largest in the country - before his body was taken in a coffin draped in the Palestinian flag for burial at a cemetery in Lusail, a city north of Doha.\nSeveral foreign officials were present at the funeral, including Turkey\u2019s Vice-President Cevdet Yilmaz and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.\nHaniyeh was killed during a visit to Iran\u2019s capital. Iran and its allies have blamed Israel, though Israel has not claimed responsibility for his death.\nThe funeral, a high-security affair, was attended by prominent figures from both Hamas and their Palestinian rivals Fatah - as well as members of the public.\nHamas officials had earlier stood on the tarmac at Doha Airport as the plane carrying Haniyeh\u2019s coffin landed from the Iranian capital Tehran on Thursday afternoon.\nTurkey and Pakistan announced a day of mourning on Friday in honour of Haniyeh, while Hamas has called for \"roaring anger marches... from every mosque\" to take place after Friday prayers to protest Haniyeh's killing.\nAt a separate funeral ceremony for Haniyeh which took place in Tehran on Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the prayers. He had earlier vowed that Israel would suffer a \u201charsh punishment\u201d for the killing.\nHaniyeh had been based in Doha since about 2019. The Hamas political office moved to the Qatari capital in 2012, following the closure of its previous office in Damascus, Syria.\nHaniyeh had played a key role in indirect talks with Israel over a potential ceasefire deal for the war in Gaza. \nThe heads of the CIA, Mossad and the intelligence services of Egypt and Qatar had attended negotiations in Doha.\nHaniyeh\u2019s burial caps a week of soaring tensions in the Middle East, which escalated with the killing of 12 children and teenagers in a strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\nIsrael accused Hezbollah and vowed \u201csevere\u201d retaliation, though Hezbollah denied it was involved.\nDays later, senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr was killed in a targeted Israeli air strike in Beirut. Four others, including two children, were also killed.\nHours after that, Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran, Hamas's main backer. He was visiting to attend the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian.\nIsrael has not claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said afterward that Israel delivered \u201ccrushing blows\u201d to Iran\u2019s proxy groups in recent days.\nA senior Hamas official told the BBC the killing took place in the same building where Haniyeh had stayed during previous visits to Iran. Three Hamas leaders and a number of guards were with him in the same building, they said.\nThe killing of Haniyeh left the leadership of Hamas in \u201ca state of shock\u201d, top Hamas officials told the BBC.\nThe circumstances around his death remain unclear.\nKhalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, told a news conference that a missile hit Haniyeh \"directly\", citing witnesses who were with him.\nBut a report in the New York Times, which cites seven officials, says Haniyeh was killed by a bomb that had been smuggled two months ago into the building where he was staying.\nThe BBC has not been able to verify either of these claims.",
    "Newham Council says it could go bust due to increasing \"challenges with temporary accommodation\" (TA).\nIn a new review, the east London authority announced it was more than \u00a322m in deficit and \"some form of government assistance may also be required\".\nIt comes as new data from London Councils suggested council spending on TA for homeless households rose by 25% between April 2023 and April 2024.\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said it would \"take action\" on the wider issue of homelessness and develop a \"strategy\".\nIn the Summer 2024 Finance Review released on Thursday, Newham Council said it was among those struggling with the cost of TA.\nIt said spending in this area was projected to exceed \u00a340m over the coming year, despite \"allocating a further \u00a318.5m\" to the TA budget.\nIf costs do reach this level, the review said it would account for a third of its total spending, which when combined with the two-thirds of the budget spent on social care, \"would leave very little resource for any other service\".\nIt comes as London Councils\u2019 latest survey of borough councils shows between April 2023 and April 2024 TA spending for homeless households rose by 25%.\nThe number of households living in temporary accommodation also increased, by 10%, to 60,959.\nOf those households in TA, the number of families placed in B&Bs by boroughs has also grown by a quarter to 2,249 families.\nThe survey results suggest this is putting pressure on budgets too - with 29 of the 33 councils overspending on their homelessness budgets by a collective total of \u00a3208m in the 2023-24 financial year.\nZulfiqar Ali, Newham Council's lead member for finance and resources, said despite \"many initiatives, prevention strategies and robust financial management, the challenges with TA remain and are forecast to grow significantly\" due to \"the growing number of people seeking help\".\nMr Ali said the council was taking \"as many actions as possible to ensure that we are able to continue delivering services for our residents\" including cost-cutting, using reserves and selling assets.\nHowever, he said \"some form of government assistance may also be required\" because the measures \"won\u2019t be enough\".\n\"Past government policies and the inefficacies of the housing market in London and the UK have failed us,\" he added.\nIn the review, Mr Ali also alleged there were regional disparities in central government funding per household and the homelessness prevention grant \"is not distributed accurately or fairly\".\nHe used Wiltshire Council as an example, saying it received the equivalent of \u00a38,604.26 per household compared to \u00a31,816.82 per household in Newham.\nThe council's cabinet is due to meet on Tuesday to discuss the budget issues.\nCouncils are required by law to produce a balanced budget and, if a council cannot balance its budget, its finance officer issues what is known as a Section 114 notice.\nLocal authorities cannot actually go \u201cbankrupt\u201d, but a Section 114 notice prevents the council from carrying out any new spending until it can balance its books.\nIt can mean councils then have to make cuts to non-statutory services to find savings.\nAn MHCLG spokesperson said: \u201cHomelessness levels have sky-rocketed and too many families are living in temporary accommodation in our towns and cities, including London boroughs like Newham.\n\u201cWe will take the action needed to tackle this issue and develop a long-term, cross-government strategy, working with mayors and councils to put Britain back on track to ending homelessness.\u201d\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Residents of a new housing development in Glasgow say their streets are being taken over by people using it as a \"free car park\".\nHomeowners on the Northbridge estate in Sighthill say they struggle to park their cars due to people leaving their vehicles in the area to avoid high parking charges and the low emission zone (LEZ) in the city centre.\nThe estate is part of a scheme which includes the Sighthill Bridge over the M8 and is designed to ease pedestrian and cyclist access to the city centre.\nHowever, the scheme has attracted city centre workers and students keen to avoid the city centre charges. \n\"The council say they're aware of the issues but they created the problem by not putting in any parking restrictions,\" says local resident Peter Collins.\nGlasgow City Council said it was considering parking control measures to protect residents.\nNorthbridge is part of a \u00a3250m regeneration of Sighthill through the Glasgow Region City Deal, which is funded by the UK and Scottish governments.\nBut Mr Collins said the area has been plagued by anti-social behaviour, pests and graffiti since he first moved there in 2022.\nAnd the 46-year-old said the streets were now regularly used for free parking by city centre workers and students.\n\"There were about 50 big vans around our three streets last week,\" he said. \n\"The council told us they couldn't afford to do parking but this is supposed to be the biggest investment in a development of its kind outside of London.\"\nMr Collins said residents had been \"passed back and forth\" between police and the council when issues came up.\nHe said there had been incidents of disabled people not being able to access their homes and people being blocked in by other cars.\n\"Police say parking is a council issue and then the council say they don't have the resources,\" he said.\n\"There are zero parking restrictions and the council say it is a priority area since its right by the LEZ, but in the meantime people are using it as a free car park for the city centre.\n\"They park on the drop kerbs and on the pavements, which is illegal, and I've fallen twice because of it. \n\"My dog's nearly been knocked down twice because you're always coming out between cars and you can't see what's coming.\"\nResidents have urged the council to tackle the problem by introducing parking permits or double yellow lines. \nResident Angela said she was often woken up in the morning by city centre workers arriving early to park in the street.\n\"I\u2019ve seen people park here, get their suitcases out and head to the city centre and then they don\u2019t come back for several days so I\u2019m assuming they went off on holiday,\" she said. \n\"There\u2019s still work waiting to be done on the other side of the development and I\u2019ve got no idea how they\u2019re going to get big vehicles down the street.\"\nSighthill Bridge opened next to the development in 2023 and reconnected the area to the city centre over the M8.\nJames, 21, moved into the development when it was first built and told BBC Scotland News he usually struggled to find a place to park in front of his own house.\n\"A lot of people park here and walk across the bridge to avoid the LEZ,\" he said. \n\"It mostly seems to be city centre workers or students walking across to Glasgow Caledonian or Strathclyde University.\"\nSteven, 27, lives in one of the new houses and said he was considering turning his garden into a double drive for his and his girlfriend's cars.\n\"Often people park all the way down to the traffic lights and it ends up creating a one-way road which is quite dangerous,\" he said. \n\"And a lot of people park here to walk over to the Royal Infirmary since it\u2019s just a five-minute walk.\"\nA council spokesperson said: \u201cWe are currently considering parking control measures to protect residents in Sighthill from people coming into the area to park in this way.  \n\"If driveways, etc, are being blocked residents should contact Police Scotland.\u201d",

    "BBC presenter Amelia Reynolds was diagnosed with bowel cancer three years ago. After having chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she was fortunately given the all clear. Here, in her own words, she talks about one of the most difficult conversations a parent can ever have - telling their children they have cancer.\nA cancer diagnosis can be extremely hard to explain to a child. And like many parents, when I first heard the words 'I'm sorry it is cancer', my immediate thought was 'what on earth am I going to say to my children?'.\nAli Howell, 42, had the same reaction. In fact, in many ways, Ali's story is similar to mine. Three years ago, pretty much at the end of the second wave of Covid, she found blood in her stools and decided to get checked.\n\"I went for what I thought was a routine colonoscopy and almost thought I was wasting NHS time, because I felt maybe there were other people that need this more than me and then I was taken out of the proceedure and taken into a side room and was told they had found something that they probably thought was cancerous,\" she says.\nI ended up in a side room like that too. But after various tests I was told treatment could cure my cancer. Ali's news was different and devastating.\n\"Unfortunately when they did further scans they found that it had already spread to my liver and I was diagnosed with secondary stage four bowel cancer,\" she says.\n\"They told me they could treat it to extend my life I suppose, but there wasn't any way of getting rid of the cancer. It was one of those out-of-body moments where you can't quite believe what you're hearing. At that point I was given a prognosis of about 18 months.\"\nThat was three years ago and as Ali says, \"I'm still here\". But her focus in that moment was her children. Her daughter Esmae was five at the time, her son Ollie was 10.\n\"That was the thing that broke me. It wasn't the thought about what would happen to me, but rather about what would happen to my children and how this would it affect them. That was the thing that hit me. That made it real.\"\nAli and her husband decided it was really important to be honest. Not to hide anything and importantly to use the word cancer.\n\"We explained to them that actually the doctors were going to do everything to help me and treat me, but they couldn't get rid of it and it was something we were going to live with and that meant I probably wasn't going to be around for a long time.\"\nIt is a conversation no parent ever wants to have. It is difficult. It is scary. And that is why a new service is being launched by the Big C Cancer charity, offering help specifically for families.\nThe charity supports children across the region, including those getting treatment at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and in Suffolk.\nAli's daughter Esmae, who is now nine, is already benefitting. In a brightly coloured room with comfy sofas, cushions and toys, she has been playing hopscotch while I have been talking to Ali. Her face is bright, her manner relaxed, she is happy to chat and eager I spell her name correctly. I promise her I will. \n\"I like doing colouring with Emma and I like doing things like crafty things and talking with Emma and doing games on the floor,\" she says.\nEmma is one of the support workers along with Corinne Cambridge who explains what the new service will offer.\n\"We know that when a young person has cancer, or a parent has cancer, it affects the whole family. And we are going to support them through having a safe place to play, having a space for parents to get some support with maybe some of our other services,\" she says.\n\"We also have an educational psychologist who has joined our team and he will be providing holisitic support when it comes to helping children to navigate school going through a cancer journey.\"\nThe Big C centre is on the site of the Norfolk and Norwich hospital. In fact it is just a few steps from the door that leads to the wards where both Ali and I received treatment. But you do not have to be given chemotherapy and radiotherapy there in order to access the help and support on offer. The doors, say the charity, are always open.\nMoney for the service has been raised by a group called the Ladies in League Against Cancer (LILAC), a voluntary fundraising group, but Esmae herself has also done her bit.

    "The manager of a restaurant that has been crashed into for a third time says there is a real risk someone will be seriously hurt or killed.\nSan Tse said it felt like a bomb had gone off when a vehicle ploughed into the Royal Phoenix Chinese restaurant in Oswaldtwistle at 02:30 BST on Tuesday.\nShe added that she had repeatedly asked the council to install a speed camera outside the restaurant in the hope it would encourage drivers to slow down.\nLancashire County Council said it would install temporary signage and look to add a speed indicator device in the area.\nSpeaking of the moment the car collided with the restaurant, Ms Tse said: \"It was such a massive collision, I rushed over from my home when it happened. It really did shake the building as if there was an earthquake or a bomb.\nMs Tse, who manages the restaurant, said it was not the first time a vehicle had ended up in the premises. She said a driver crashed through the front of the building in 2011 and a car also hit the restaurant's front door in 2019.\nThe 44-year-old said there had also been a handful of near misses at the restaurant, which is situated opposite a mini roundabout junction.\n\"Sometimes I sit at the bar and watch the traffic speed past and I think, how many more of these near misses before someone gets hurt?\" she said.\n\"The first time it happened [in 2011] it was during opening hours, so it's only luck that there wasn't a staff member standing there.\n\"It's an absolute blessing that none of our staff or customers have been hurt.\"\nShe said she had repeatedly asked the council to install a speed camera outside the restaurant but her requests had been ignored.\n\"People don't drive at the speed limit because there's a mini roundabout.\n\"How many more of these near accidents will there be before the council take it seriously?\"\nLancashire County Council said: \"There have been three collisions on this road in the last five years, with a high speed of 24.1mph recorded on Moscow Mill Street which is a 20mph limit street,\" the spokesman said.\n\"We have previously deployed temporary road safety signage to this location  and will look to deploy temporary signs again. \n\"We will also book this location on our speed indicator device schedule to positively influence driver behavioural change.\"\nMs Tse said the business had been forced to close following the incident and although they had been inundated with support and offers to help clean up from the community, they were worried about lost earnings.\n\"The restaurant has been in the heart of the community since 1990,\" she said.\n\"The love we have received from the community has been incredible.

    "Violent disorder in Belfast following an anti-immigration protest was outrageous, one of the UK\u2019s most prominent far-right voices has said.\nOn Tuesday, I spoke to Rev Jim Dowson, who was a founder of the anti-Islamic group Britain First and was once described as Britain\u2019s most influential far-right activist by anti-racism campaigners.\nHe told me that he believed the majority of people oppose mass immigration, but he said it was not a problem in Northern Ireland.\nHe explained he does not know what the weekend demonstrations were meant to achieve.\n\u201cIt was great to see people from different communities - tricolours, red hands of Ulster, flying together, rather shocking for somebody my age. \n\"So pleased to see it, but what happened later on that day, it descended into nuttiness,\u201d he suggested.\n\u201cAttacking people, burning people's businesses. I know one of the businesses that was burnt, outrageous.\u201d\nThe weekend clashes saw a number of businesses targeted on Saturday, followed by further disorder in Sandy Row on Monday evening. \nMr Dowson, who left Britain First in 2014, has a long history of far-right activism and has clear views on immigration.\nFrom Scotland, he now lives in Northern Ireland and was handed a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to participating in unlawful public processions in 2013.\nThis was in relation to protests about the flying of the union flag at Belfast City Hall.\nI asked him whether concern about immigration could become racism.\n\"Well, I don't think it slides into racism, it's pushed into racism because nobody's allowed to have a genuine conversation about it,\" he responded.\n\"If, over the last 20 years in this country people could have genuine sensible grown-up mature and decent conversations about the levels of immigration and the genuine worries people have got when they see their communities changing, people with another agenda would never have taken root,\u201d he continued.\nI put it to Mr Dowson that immigrants were not to blame for housing shortages in Northern Ireland or pressures on the health service and he could be accused of dog whistling for racism.\nHe said Northern Ireland was \u201cslightly different\u201d and \u201cwe don't have a lot of immigrants\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can ever point to an example where I've been saying Northern Ireland's under this terrible pressure because of mass immigration.\u201d\nBusiness owners whose shops and livelihoods were destroyed over the weekend in Belfast, have questioned whether they wish to reopen.\nMr Dowson suggested the disorder was stoked by social media posts, to which I challenged if he was being hypocritical for his own past use of social media.\nHe said: \u201cI used social media very effectively in the flag protests because it was something I cared passionately about and still do and I think if it had been played different we could have won a victory there. But that's a big difference from inciting people.\"\nMr Dowson said he had never expressed concern about immigration levels in Northern Ireland and claimed the issue was bigger in England and the Republic of Ireland.",

    "Disney World is arguing a man cannot sue it over the death of his wife because of terms he signed up to in a free trial of Disney+.\nJeffrey Piccolo filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Disney and the owners of a restaurant after his wife died in 2023 from a severe allergic reaction after eating at the theme park.\nHowever, Disney argues its terms of use, which Mr Piccolo agreed to when creating his Disney account in 2019, means they have to settle out of court. \n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the family\u2019s loss and understand their grief,\" Disney said in a statement.\n\"Given that this restaurant is neither owned nor operated by Disney, we are merely defending ourselves against the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s attempt to include us in their lawsuit against the restaurant.\u201d\nThe couple had dined at Raglan Road, an Ireland-themed pub located at Disney Springs, a part of the vast Walt Disney World complex in Orlando, Florida.\nRepresentatives for Raglan Road and Mr Piccolo have been contacted for comment.\nMr Piccolo alleges that the restaurant did not take enough care over his wife's severe allergies to dairy and nuts, despite being repeatedly told about them.\nDr Kanokporn Tangsuan died in hospital later that day, 5 October 2023. \nAccording to the legal filing, her death was confirmed by a medical examiner \"as a result of anaphylaxis due to elevated levels of dairy and nut in her system.\"\nMr Piccolo is suing Disney for a sum in excess of $50,000 plus legal costs.\nDisney wants the case in the courts to be halted, and for the dispute to be resolved out of court, in a process called arbitration. \nThe entertainment company argues it cannot be taken to court because, in its terms of use, it says users agree to settle any disputes with the company via arbitration.\nIt says Mr Piccolo agreed to these terms of use when he signed up to a one month free trial of its streaming service, Disney+, in 2019.\nDisney adds that Mr Piccolo accepted these terms again when using his Disney account to buy tickets for the theme park in 2023. \nMr Piccolo's lawyers call Disney's arguments \"preposterous\" and \"inane\". \nThey say Disney's case \"is based on the incredible argument that any person who signs up for a Disney+ account, even free trials that are not extended beyond the trial period, will have forever waived the right to a jury trial\".\nThe argument that this can be extended to wrongful death or personal injury claims \"borders on the surreal,\" according to the legal filing.\nThey also argue that Mr Piccolo agreed to the Disney terms of use for himself, whereas he is now acting on behalf of his deceased wife, who never agreed to the terms.\n\"Disney is pushing the envelope of contract law,\" says Ernest Aduwa, partner at Stokoe Partnership Solicitors, who are not involved in the proceedings.\n\"The courts will have to consider, on balance, if the arbitration clause in a contract for a streaming service can really be applied to as serious an allegation of wrongful death through negligence at a theme park,\" he says.\nHe adds: \"Disney\u2019s argument that accepting their terms and conditions for one product covers all interactions with that company is novel and potentially far reaching.\"\nJibreel Tramboo, barrister at Church Court Chambers, says the terms in the Disney+ trial are a \"weak argument for Disney to rely on\".\nHowever, he says, the clause in the ticket purchase from 2023 may be a stronger case, \"as there is a similar arbitration clause\".\n\"That may permit Disney to stay the case for arbitration,\" he says, \"although there are many other threads that may prevent them going to arbitration given the delicate circumstances in this case.\" \nMr Piccolo wants the case to go in front of a jury in a court of law. \nDisney's motion to take the case out of court and decided by arbitration will be heard in front of a Florida judge in October. \nArbitration means the dispute is overseen by a neutral third party who is not a judge.\nIt is usually a quicker and cheaper process than a court case.\n\"Disney understandably may want to benefit from the privacy and confidentiality that arbitration brings, rather than having a wrongful death suit heard in public with the associated publicity,\" says Jamie Cartwright, partner at law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.",
    "A campaign group has launched a petition in an effort to stop a housing development being built on the site of an airfield.\nDevelopers want to build 1,600 homes and a primary school at Tollerton airfield, in Nottinghamshire.\nThe runway, air traffic control building and a caf\u00e9 at the site would be demolished under the plans at the airfield, which is home to Nottingham City Airport.\nThe Save Nottingham City Airfield group launched a petition two weeks ago and said since then, it had received more than 2,000 signatures.\nConcerns about emergency helicopters losing a refuelling spot, the impact on biodiversity and job losses have been raised by the group. \nThe campaign is calling on Rushcliffe Borough Council to remove the airfield from its homes allocation in the Greater Nottinghamshire Strategic Plan.\nSarah Deacon, a nursing lecturer and chair of the group, said: \"Not having the airport would mean we would lose the night landing capability for the air ambulance, which is absolutely crucial to allow 24/7 access to the trauma hub at the Queen's Medical Centre.\n\"There are very few trauma centres unfortunately that do have 24/7 access and we are very lucky.\n\"If we look at taking that away and adding an extra 10 or 20 miles to the journey by road, it's been documented in several research studies that it adds an extra 1% mortality risk.\n\"So it could mean the difference literally of life and limb. We're hoping we can help to save the airport for generations to come.\"\nA planning application for 400 homes was submitted to the council in March, and forms part of the wider proposal to build 1,600 homes at the airfield.\nThe developer Vistry Group said the project would create hundreds of jobs for local people.\nAnother development has been proposed for land next to the airfield, after an application for 2,250 homes, a primary school and other infrastructure was put forward in 2020.\nSarah, who runs the Save Nottingham City (Tollerton) Airfield Facebook page, added: \"People recognise that losing the airport would mean losing an enormous swathe of grass meadow. They are really concerned about losing the biodiversity of the site.\n\"People are also concerned about the jobs. There are seven businesses on the site, up to 70 jobs locally would be lost if the site was lost.\n\"It's really important that people understand it isn't a done deal. There\u2019s this planning process within our country that is there to make sure that we keep our generation and generations to come safe.\"\nThe local strategic plan has allocated for up to 4,000 homes to be built on the site and surrounding areas.\nA Rushcliffe Borough Council spokesperson said: \"We do not intend to consider the planning application until the masterplan that includes the Tollerton Airport site is in place and we are awaiting developers to submit this to be considered by the council.\n\"At that point we will formally consult local residents, technical consultees, ward members and the relevant parish councils, all of whom will have the chance to comment on the proposals.\"\nA statement from Vistry Group added: \"The planning application and allocation will enable new jobs and training opportunities for local people and companies, during and after construction.\n\"It is estimated that some 500 direct and indirect jobs will be created during the construction stage of Vistry application, with some 1,500 jobs provided for by the allocation overall following completion.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A family has criticised a newly-installed children's play area aimed at supporting inclusivity at a Leicestershire park.\nEquipment including a zip line, balance trail, climbing frame and sensory area are in place at Brocks Hill Country Park, Oadby, which opened at the end of July.\nBut the parents of one young girl, who is dependent on a wheelchair, said the playground was \"not inclusive at all\" as it was at the top of a steep hill with no paths.\nOadby and Wigston Borough Council, which runs the country park, admitted there had been \"accessibility challenges\", but hoped the play area would \"meet the needs of a wide range of children\". \nLouisa and James's daughter Anna, eight, has Pitt-Hopkins syndrome - a rare genetic syndrome. \n\"It affects all parts of her development,\" Louisa said. \"Her mobility, speech, her understanding. She loves people and being around other children, so parks are great places to go. \n\"She needs stimulation, movement - things like swings and roundabouts - the same as other children.\"\nThe parents, from Wigston, said they were \"shocked and extremely disappointed\" with the new park and raised concerns over access issues for disabled children.\nLouisa, 44, said: \"It\u2019s built right at the top of the hill, so trying to get up the grass verge is very difficult and will be nigh on impossible in the winter when it\u2019s all swampy.\n\"Then actually seeing the new equipment, there are no paths around for wheelchairs. So it\u2019s very difficult for her to access it.\"\nShe said the sensory zone, which includes panels and sign language prompts, was a \"step in the right direction\", but added: \"Putting in some sensory boards ticks a box, but by no means makes it inclusive. \n\"Anna had to sit and watch the able children play. It broke our hearts.\n\"The money would have been better spent making access possible for all.\"\nJames, 42, felt the facility had not been thought through and more communication and discussions were needed.\n\"It almost feels like it's been tucked away in the corner,\" he said. \n\"There's so much more space. They could have spread it out and made it more accessible.\"\nThe couple urged the council to have a rethink and \"consult a range of families and people to make sure the parks are inclusive in the future\".\nThey added: \"Anna's non-verbal, so we have to be her voice.\"\nCouncil leader Samia Haq said: \"Accessibility is always at the forefront of our minds and the new play area has tactile and sensory elements to meet the needs of a wide range of children. \n\"We're also fortunate in Oadby and Wigston to have a number of different parks and play areas in a relatively small area, helping to meet different needs.\n\"By its very nature, a country park will always pose some accessibility challenges, not least that Brocks Hill is on a significant incline. \n\"It is a fine balance between maintaining that natural, nature supporting, country park feel that we all love, while also achieving complete accessibility for all.\n\"We are always on the look out for funding opportunities that might help us to improve the accessibility of all our parks, including Brocks Hill, and this feedback only increases that determination.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "For more than a week, far-right violence has been flaring up in cities in England and Northern Ireland \u2013 but not so far in Scotland.\nIt begs the question, are we immune north of the border?\nThe violence began after the murders of three girls in Southport in Merseyside. Posts online falsely suggested the attacker was Muslim and an asylum seeker.\nMosques have been targeted, police officers hurt and businesses torched \u2013 including hotels known to house asylum seekers.\nHistorian Prof Murray Pittock is wary of the term \"Scottish exceptionalism\". This is a phrase used to describe a particular attitude, a sense of moral superiority - that things are different here; that views and attitudes are much more liberal and forward-thinking.\nBut he does say that attitudes in Scotland towards immigration are more favourable.\n\"I think there's a balance here. You don't want to be going down the route that Scotland's exceptional, saying: \u2018We will never do things like this\u2019. Nor do you want to go down the route of saying: \u2018Actually, it's just the same as the rest of the UK\u2019.  It's clearly not.\n\"There hasn't been a large-scale, enabling narrative which has been condemnatory of immigration.\n\"There's been pro-immigrant rhetoric and that's increasingly borne out in the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey, which is more pro-immigrant. It's now more pro-immigrant than south of the border.\u201d\nScotland is not the only part of the UK to avoid the disorder - Wales has also managed to stay clear of the ugliest scenes witnessed since the tragic events in Southport.\nMuch of the trouble has been incited \u2013 and indeed organised \u2013 through social media, inflamed by negative and often racist sentiments about immigration.\nThe very first rally in Southport had been discussed on anti-immigration channels on the Telegram messaging app. Police said the violence was believed to have involved supporters of the now disbanded far-right group the English Defence League (EDL).\nThe EDL's founder, convicted criminal Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), has also been posting about \"pro-UK\" rallies in cities including Glasgow next month, saying \"the British are rising\u201d.\nBut both in Scotland and Wales, rumoured far-right protests have so far failed to materialise. When hundreds gathered for an anti-racism rally in Glasgow on Saturday, only two counter-protesters turned up. \nJournalist Lizzie Dearden, who commentates on home affairs issues and is an expert on the far-right in the UK, says Southport is not the first incident that has been used to fuel far-right agendas.\nIf anything, she says, it is part of a long-running pattern whereby there has been a \u201cfrenzy of activity\u201d after terror attacks among the far-right, who seek to \u201cpresent the different minority groups as a threat\u201d.\nIn Scotland, though, she says the far-right has to work harder to convince people of this.\n\u201cI think there are still people who are active in these networks in Scotland and they are likely to try to capitalise on this terrible attack in Southport as they did in England,\" she says.\n\u201cPolling and other kinds of measures show that Scotland has a more positive attitude towards migration, a lower concern about things like small boats - which are naturally more geographically keenly felt on the southern coast of England - and a more positive attitude towards refugees.\u201d\nAs for planned events in Scotland, Ms Dearden says it is still possible there could be some form of protest \u2013 but that it would be \u201cfairly small\u201d.\nProf Sir John Curtice, who keeps a close eye on the barometer of public attitudes, agrees - but says the idea of Scotland as \u201ca wholly welcoming nation\" is \"too rosy a picture\u201d.\nAlthough Scots are less likely to be concerned about immigration, he says a key issue is that campaigns that focus on \u201cBritishness\u201d do not have the same resonance in Scotland.\n\"For many people, their principal sense of identity is Scottishness,\u201d he says.\nSir John says population plays a part too, with the proportion of people identifying as Muslim in Scotland much smaller than in England.\nThe latest Scottish census shows 7% of the population is from an ethnic minority, compared to 18% overall in the UK.\nSir John also says the message of the party in government is very different in Scotland. The SNP is described as a \"civic nationalist party\", which says it welcomes people irrespective of birth or ancestry as long as they are willing to commit themselves to Scotland.\nHe adds: \u201cIt's also the case that attitudes to immigration, particularly among politicians, is also different because Scotland faces a particularly difficult demographic timebomb - there are more politicians who are likely to argue that Scotland needs immigration.\u201d\nOf course, this comes just as former First Minister Humza Yousaf publicly questioned whether he sees a life for himself and his family in Scotland, or in the West, in the wake of the riots.\nUnsurprisingly, the police shy away from being too specific about why nothing has happened in S",
    "Medical advice for a man in council-funded care was not sought soon enough in the days leading up to his death, a report has said.\nThe Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman found a patient, known as Mr F, was treated unjustly at a care home arranged by North Tyneside Council.\nThe ombudsman found a number of failings with Mr F's care while he was living at Charlton Court Care Home, in Wallsend, including the patient being told he would not be looked after if he shouted.\nThe council said cases such as this were \"absolutely heartbreaking\" and it would be reviewing procedures at Charlton Court.\nMr F had a chest infection in December 2022 but his conditioned worsened in January 2023.\nHe began coughing and vomiting on the night of 19 January but the care home waited until 22 January to call an ambulance.\nHe was found to be \"gravely ill with pneumonia\" and died in hospital a few days later.\nMr F's family had visited him on 20 January and heard staff say they would not help the patient if he shouted.\nThe care home later apologised to Mr F's widow, but the ombudsman found that \"medical advice should have been sought sooner\". \n\"This may not have changed the outcome for Mr F but the delay in seeking advice causes distress and uncertainty,\" the report said.\nThe care home acknowledged there were times when Mr F had to wait for care, which the ombudsman said \"adversely affected his dignity\".\nFollowing a stroke, Mr F was required to be fed via a tube by a nurse. However, on one occasion he was fed by a care assistant, which put him at risk of harm.\nThere were also delays in the care home getting advice on whether a chair used by Mr F was suitable or could be adjusted for his needs.\nCharlton Court Care Home is a private facility operated by Akari Care. However, Mr F's care was arranged and funded by the council.\nNorth Tyneside Council has apologised to Mrs F and agreed to pay her \u00a3500 to acknowledge the distress caused.\nDirector of adult\u2019s services at North Tyneside Council, Eleanor Binks, said the council had \"taken action\" and processes would be put in place to prevent similar situations occurring again.\n\"The health and wellbeing of our residents will always come first, and we will do everything within our gift to support them in whatever way we can,\" she said.\n\"We will continue to work alongside the care provider and the team at Charlton Court to support them in providing high-quality care for our residents, and ensuring that the high standards we set for ourselves are being met across all providers.\"\nCharlton Court Care Home has been contacted for comment.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was conceived in the Kremlin as a short, sharp military operation. \nThe expectation was that it would take a matter of days, a few weeks maximum, for Russia to establish control over its neighbour.\nThat was nearly two-and-a-half years ago.\nThe war in Ukraine rages on. It has not gone at all as Moscow had intended.\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Over the last 29 months, so often we\u2019ve heard senior Russian officials claiming that the operation is going \u201caccording to plan.\u201d\nPresident Vladimir Putin last said that in May, despite everything that had happened in the preceding two years: the heavy Russian casualties on the battlefield, the destruction of multiple Russian warships in the Black Sea, drone attacks deep inside Russia (even on the Kremlin itself), the shelling of Russian towns and villages near the Ukrainian border, the mutiny by Wagner mercenary fighters who had marched on Moscow.\nNow there is a new addition to the list: this week\u2019s cross-border Ukrainian assault on Russia\u2019s Kursk region.\nFirst, a disclaimer: it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what is happening right now in the Sudzha district of Kursk region. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops are there, how much territory they have seized and what their final objective may be.\nToday\u2019s edition of the Russian broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta declared: \u201cEvents on the Kursk front are shrouded in the notorious fog of war.\u201d\nBut even in fog, some things are clear.\nIt\u2019s evident that what is unfolding in Kursk region is further evidence that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has not gone \"according to plan\". Events appear to have taken Russia\u2019s political and military leadership completely by surprise.\nDon\u2019t expect Moscow to admit that.\nMore likely, Russian officials will use the Ukrainian assault to try to rally the Russian public around the government and bolster the official Kremlin narrative that (a) in this conflict Russia is not the aggressor, and (b) Russia is a besieged fortress surrounded by enemies who are plotting to invade and destroy it.\nIn reality it was Russia that launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour.\nThere\u2019s clearly a big difference in language. When Russia poured its troops across the border into Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin called this a \"special military operation\" and claimed that Russia was \u201cliberating\u201d towns and villages.\nMoscow has described Ukrainian troops pushing into Russia as \u201ca terrorist attack\u201d and \u201ca provocation.\u201d\nThe assault by Ukrainian forces on Kursk region and the fierce fighting there are a sign that hostilities are coming closer to home. But will that turn Russian public opinion against the war?\nNot necessarily.\nLast year I visited Belgorod, a Russian region which, like Kursk, borders Ukraine. It was being shelled from across the border. Everyone I met told me that nothing like this had happened before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine: before February 2022 it was all peace and quiet in Belgorod region. \nBut instead of concluding that the \"special military operation\" had been a mistake, most people I spoke to called for Russia to step up its military action and push deeper into Ukrainian territory.\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is calling for exactly that. In a social media post today he wrote:\n\u201cWe can and we should take more land of the Ukraine that still exists. [We should go to] Odesa, to Kharkiv, to Dnipro, Mykolaiv. To Kyiv and onwards.\u201d\nBut Dmitry Medvedev doesn\u2019t get to call the shots. Vladimir Putin does. We wait to see how he responds to what have been a dramatic few days in southern Russia.",

But despite hundreds of police officers being deployed, businesses boarding-up their windows and closing early, far-right groups did not appear.\nThe BBC has been speaking to community leaders and organisations and asked for their reflections on the last week, and what happens next.\nCouncil of Bristol Mosques chair and founder Arif Khan, said the \"threat hasn't gone\".\n\"They didn't come last night, but it doesn't mean they won't come to Bristol at all,\" he said.\n\"They could turn up tomorrow.

They think 'yes we won'. Even the far-right know they'd never succeed in Bristol.\n\"By the looks of things what we saw how people got together, we know they will never succeed.\"\nTensions have been high across England after the killing of three young girls in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July.\nOn Saturday, disorder led to smashed windows and groups becoming aggressive with police before attempting to storm Mercure Hotel which is housing asylum seekers.\nThey sang Rule Britannia, \"England 'til I die\" and \"we want our country back\".\nWhen they arrived at the hotel, guests were seen looking out of their windows and anti-racism protesters formed a wall by locking arms outside its entrance.\nAlex Raikes, chief executive of Stand Against Racism & Inequality, said seeing shops in Old Market boarded up was \"almost dystopic\" on Wednesday.\n\"We had projects for children cancelled, staff sent home. It was like Covid but for such a horrific reason,\" she said.\n\"I had people in tears, saying they feel like they can't walk around anywhere without worrying who might attack me or my children.\"\nBut she said seeing the many people turn out \"restored some perceptions of community safety\".\nShe said: \"There's not much that could have done that for people, and I thought how on earth are people going to feel safe again? But the masses of people who turned out helped enormously.\"\nGoing forward, Ms Raikes said there needs to be more conversation.\n\"Talking makes a difference.

    "A 14-year-old girl has said getting a stoma saved her life and was \"the best thing I ever did\".\nImogen from Basingstoke, Hampshire, underwent a subtotal colectomy - where most of the colon is removed - in March, less than a year after being diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\nA recent study by Southampton Children's Hospital (SCH) found the number of children and young adults being diagnosed with IBD has more than doubled in the last 10 years.\nConsultant paediatric gastroenterologist Dr James Ashton said removing part of the bowel is a last resort, but for Imogen it had been \"transformational\".\nImogen's symptoms were initially put down to anxiety, but after losing almost three stone and being admitted to hospital, she was diagnosed with IBD in April 2023.\nShe was tried on various medications and infusions, but she said it \"got to the point where the pain made me not want to wake up\" and eventually she had to have a subtotal colectomy.\n\"I woke up from the surgery, and the pain - it was just completely gone,\" she said.\n\"It felt like a miracle.\"\nIBD refers to a range of conditions involving chronic inflammation of tissues in the digestive tract, but the main types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\nThe study by SCH, which used data from five NHS sites including Oxford, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff, found all sites had seen a sustained increase in diagnosis of IBD in children since 2013.\nDr Ashton said the findings were \"really important\" and that there was likely to be \"multiple\" factors behind the increase, including dietary factors such as an increase in highly processed foods.\n\"We can't infer causation from that, but its really important to note that as a possible trigger,\" he said.\nDr Ashton said the findings from the study would aid understanding of the disease, something he hoped would reduce the need for colectomies.\nBut for Imogen, the surgery \"gave me my life back\".\n\"I think my bag's beautiful,\" she said.\n\"I couldn't even come out of my room before because I felt that ill... now I can go anywhere.

    "The US government has filed a new lawsuit against TikTok, accusing the social media company of unlawfully collecting children's data and failing to respond when parents tried to delete their children's accounts. \nThe Department of Justice said the firm's practices amounted to a \"massive-scale\" invasion of child privacy, in defiance of laws that require online companies to obtain parental consent to gather information for those under the age of 13.\nOfficials said the firm, and parent company ByteDance, were \"repeat offenders\", noting a similar case brought in 2019. \nTikTok disputed the claims and said it was \"proud\" of its efforts to protect children.\nIt said it proactively removed underage users and had voluntarily put in place protections, such as default screen-time limits and additional privacy guards for minors. \n\"We disagree with these allegations, many of which relate to past events and practices that are factually inaccurate or have been addressed,\" a spokesperson said. \n\"We are proud of our efforts to protect children, and we will continue to update and improve the platform.\"\nThe complaint ramps up the pressure on TikTok and Chinese parent company ByteDance, which were already battling the US over a law that threatens to ban the company from the country. \nIn the filing, the US accused TikTok of implementing \"deficient\" ways of screening for accounts created by children and obstructing parents when they tried to delete them.\nA review of 1,700 requests from parents to cancel accounts that were made between 2019 and 2020 found that 30% were still active in November 2021, according to the filing. \nIt said moderators charged with reviewing accounts flagged as underage were only authorised to act if they saw explicit admission of a child's age, while being given limited access to user videos.\nIt said they typically had only a few seconds to make their decisions. \nOfficials asked the court to order a stop to TikTok's actions and determine penalties for each violation. \n\"This action is necessary to prevent the defendants, who are repeat offenders and operate on a massive scale, from collecting and using young children\u2019s private information without any parental consent or control,\u201d said principal deputy assistant attorney general Brian Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division.\nTikTok is among the most popular social media platforms in the world, claiming more than 1 billion users globally and more than 170 million in the US. \nSurveys by Pew Research have found that more than 60% of US teens aged 13-17 use the platform, more than half of them on a daily basis.  \nThe lawsuit states the US government seeks \"to put an end\" to TikTok\u2019s alleged \"unlawful massive-scale invasions of children\u2019s privacy\".\nThe company has faced fines in the UK and Europe over similar issues. \n",
    "A man identified from TikTok footage as being part of a mob that stormed a hotel used to house asylum seekers has been jailed.\nFather-of-three Trevor Lloyd, 49, of Oak Avenue, Rotherham, was among a group of rioters who entered the Holiday Inn Express in Manvers on Sunday 4 August.\nHe was pictured as part of a crowd going in to the hotel, where others removed chairs and fire extinguishers to throw at police officers outside.\nLloyd, who said he had only gone to have a look in the building after he had been shopping at a nearby Aldi, was jailed for three years at Sheffield Crown Court.\nLloyd, who is registered disabled after a car crash three years ago, did not throw items but was \u201cpassive\u201d in his involvement, his barrister Richard Adams told the court.\nHe added that his client had made \"the foolish error of deciding to go and have a look\" at the disorder.\nLloyd pleaded guilty to violent disorder at a previous hearing.\nThe Recorder of Sheffield Judge Jeremy Richardson KC described footage taken inside the hotel as the \"worst footage I have seen\", adding that \"hotel residents and staff \"would have been terrified\" when the mob smashed their way into the hotel building.\nPassing sentence he said Lloyd had set a \u201cdreadful example\u201d for his daughters by taking part in the violence, which was \"racist in nature\".\nMeanwhile, the court heard Glynn Guest, 60, of Pearson Crescent, Wombwell, had been out walking his dogs but had stayed at the disorder after being \u201cdrawn in\u201d.\nBody worn video played to the court showed him walking up to the police line six times, before eventually grabbing a riot shield and pulling an officer to the ground as the crowd around him cheered.\nPC Clark, whose camera captured Guest, said she was \u201cterrified for her safety\u201d during the incident outside the hotel.\nHis defence barrister said he was \u201cvery sorry\u201d for what he had done, adding that he had suffered a broken nose after being hit by a riot shield.\nHe admitted a charge of violent disorder at a previous court appearance.\nJailing him for two years and eight months, Judge Richardson said his actions had \u201ccast an ugly stain upon this country and South Yorkshire in particular\u201d.\nThe court also heard how Stuart Bolton, 38, drove more than 50 miles from his home in New Holland, North Lincolnshire, to hurl racist abuse at police.\nBolton, who runs a ground-working business, was jailed for two years and eight months after pleading guilty to the violent disorder.\nFootage shown on Wednesday showed him screaming abuse and goading a line of police officers protecting the hotel.\nThe judge also confiscated the Mercedes car Bolton used to drive to Rotherham, after hearing he was disqualified from driving and had no insurance, and banned him from driving for three years.\nAnother man, Elliott Wragg, 23, was jailed for two years and four months by Judge Richardson.\nWragg was one of a large \"mob\" of around 70 to 100 people who were throwing a range of items at a small group of 10 police officers outside the hotel, the court heard.\nDale Harris, defending, said his client said he had \"no racist views\" and his actions were \"wholly out of character\".\nWragg, of Assembly Way, Barnsley, admitted violent disorder at an earlier hearing.\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "For six years the BBC\u2019s Paul Adams has been in contact with a young graduate in Gaza. Her text messages give a unique insight into the terrors and small triumphs she has experienced during the current conflict, and her fears for the future.\nMy phone lights up. It is Asmaa. \u201cStill alive,\u201d she writes.\nIt is 19 March 2024 and after several weeks of silence, Asmaa Tayeh has reappeared on WhatsApp.\n\u201cSorry. Bad internet connection and dangerous days.\u201d And then silence. For another two months.\nIt has been like this since 7 October. Long disappearances, punctuated by flurries of text messages, as the 28-year-old emerges, briefly, amid the nightmare of Gaza\u2019s longest war.\nIt is always late at night. Somewhere, Asmaa has found a signal. Far away in London, my phone pings as the messages tumble in.\nI met Asmaa in 2018. I was in Gaza, reporting on daily protests at the border fence with Israel, where thousands of mostly young Palestinians angrily commemorated their ancestors\u2019 displacement during Israel\u2019s War of Independence, 70 years earlier.\nAsmaa was not part of the protests. I found her at her family\u2019s home a few miles away in Jabalia, quietly writing stories, some of which I had read online, about daily life in a place she both loved and hated.\nHer laptop was a cherished portal to the world outside. She had only ever known the Gaza Strip and its stifling sense of isolation. From her spartan room, she watched vloggers and Youtubers casually exploring places she could only dream of.\nAs a recent graduate in a place with few job prospects and frequent outbreaks of extreme violence, the exotic images flashing onto her computer screen were intoxicating but painful.\n\u201cThey show me how handcuffed I am,\u201d she wrote that year.\nA refugee camp of tents and tin shacks in the 1950s, Jabalia had long since morphed into a small city, more than 100,000 people crammed together in a place of tall buildings, teeming alleyways and open sewers.\nDespite her narrow confines, the young Asmaa was hopeful.\nIn September 2022, she launched her own business, Star Caf\u00e9, an online coffee delivery service. Her social media feeds suggested an optimistic young entrepreneur, finally achieving long-cherished goals and planning for the future.\nA year later, on 6 October 2023, in an Instagram post artfully depicting her branded products alongside a vase of roses and a manicured hand, she thanked God for \u201cthe blessing of self-employment\u201d.\nBut what she didn\u2019t know was that a meteor was hurtling in her direction, about to obliterate everything.\nThe following day, Hamas gunmen stormed across the border fence, killing about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners in nearby communities and at the Nova music festival.\nIsrael\u2019s response was like nothing Gazans had ever seen before. Its military would go on to kill tens of thousands of people, displace more than 80% of the population, and render large parts of the Gaza Strip uninhabitable.\nThree days later, on 10 October, Asmaa got in touch.\n\u201cHey Paul. It\u2019s nice to hear from you. We are unharmed,\u201d she messaged.\n\u201cBut to be honest, I don\u2019t feel safe at all. We could be bombed at any minute.\u201d\nDespite hearing air strikes hitting nearby targets, Asmaa was hopeful the war would soon be over.\nBut this was not a repeat of earlier Gaza wars. Within days, Israeli planes dropped leaflets, telling everyone in the northern Gaza Strip - more than one million people - to move south.\nJabalia started to empty, but Asmaa\u2019s family - 13 people spanning three generations - stayed put, fearing going south would prove a one-way journey.\nFor the descendants of refugees who were forced or fled from their homes in 1948, never to return, the thought of history repeating itself stirred deep fears.\nOnly her grandparents, elderly and frail, travelled, eventually finding shelter in Rafah.\nWith electricity cut, food in freezers spoiling, and communications increasingly difficult, the family used a small generator every couple of days to charge mobiles and monitor the news.\nAsmaa\u2019s messages were becoming increasingly sporadic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous all over the Gaza Strip,\u201d she told me on 15 October.\nAt the end of October, Jabalia experienced its worst air strikes so far. Israel said it had targeted underground Hamas structures and killed large numbers of fighters.\nThe scenes were apocalyptic, with civilians and rescue workers searching for survivors through vast craters and wrecked buildings.\nAsmaa vanished. My WhatsApp messages were no longer being read. I assumed the worst.\nBut six weeks later, she suddenly reappeared. \u201cI\u2019m still alive, by God\u2019s miracles,\u201d she wrote on 12 December.\nIt did, indeed, feel miraculous.\nIn a torrent of messages that followed, Asmaa described the previous chaotic weeks. The family\u2019s reluctant decision to leave Jabalia, efforts to head south thwarted by the intensity of the fighting, terrifying journeys through a city at war.\n\u201cI saw so much that I cannot find words to describe,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe streets are scary and the smell of death",
    "Hundreds of jobs could be created in green energy under plans to upgrade harbours to accommodate vessels servicing wind farms.\nNorth Yorkshire Council wants to attract offshore maintenance contractors to Scarborough and Whitby by installing \"boat hoists\" on their quaysides.\nThe machinery would be capable of lifting large vessels out of the sea and could put the two towns on the \"frontline\" of the renewables boom.\nBut a planning application to redevelop the harbour has divided Scarborough, where several residents said they wanted more investment in the town centre instead.\nThere are large wind farms at Dogger Bank, Hornsea One and Hornsea Two off the Yorkshire coast, but the turbines are currently serviced by vessels based at operations depots at the Port of Tyne and Grimsby.\nThe council has earmarked \u00a320,000 to explore the \"opportunities' offered by the industry, including improvements to Scarborough West Pier.\nCouncillor Janet Jefferson said upgrading the dock facilities could draw large employers to the area and that funding for a hoist would form an additional part of the current planning application for the West Pier's redevelopment.\nThe scheme, which was allocated \u00a311m of government \"levelling up\" money, will be debated by councillors later this month.\nDocuments already include provision for a hoist, but plans have been amended to include a larger \"boat lift\" that could accommodate the specialised offshore installation and maintenance vessels.\nMs Jefferson said: \"It is great news that \u00a320,000 has been approved to work on this project. An officer has been appointed. It is to look at the feasibility of Scarborough and Whitby harbours.\n\"Thousands of turbines are being put into the North Sea, and they have to be maintained. This is something we really have to look at. Investment would bring in all different types of professions and skills.\n\"These are viable business opportunities. It would be good for our economy, the harbour and the town. It is very, very exciting.\"\nCouncillor Mark Crane added that offshore firms could bring \"skilled and secure\" employment to the area.\nContractors running crew transfer and supply ships to and from the offshore sites have also called for capacity at docks in Yorkshire, where workers would then be likely to spend money in hotels and restaurants while in transit.\nLarger offshore vessels also require deeper harbours, which need dredging work to maintain.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "The Prime Minister has condemned \"far-right thuggery\" after masked individuals attacked police and forced their way into a hotel, which has been used to house asylum seekers.\nTrouble flared outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham as missiles were thrown at officers and a bin fire was started next to the building, which was then entered by a number of people wearing balaclavas.\nSouth Yorkshire Police described the violence as \"nothing short of disgusting\" and said at least 10 of its officers had been injured, including one who had been knocked unconscious.\nSir Keir Starmer said he would do \"whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice\".\nLive: Crowd breaks windows and throws bottles at police at Rotherham hotel\nViolence erupted after a planned demonstration by anti-immigration protesters outside the hotel escalated over the course of Sunday afternoon. \nA rival protest from an anti-racism group had also started outside the hotel about the same time, but that group was ushered away by a police escort after quickly becoming outnumbered and surrounded by the other cohort.\nObjects were then thrown at both officers and the hotel and officers soon became overwhelmed by a large group of masked individuals, some of whom forced their way inside the building after shattering a number of ground-floor windows.\nChants of \"get them out\" and \"we want our country back\" were heard.\nFlames from a bin fire, started as the demonstration grew increasingly ugly, were later put out after a short time but police officers were pelted with glass bottles and sprayed with fire extinguishers. \nFence panels ripped from the properties of nearby residents were also among the missiles thrown at police, as the crowd was later pushed into a retreat away from the hotel. \nRiot police managed to regain control of the hotel and continued to shepherd the crowd away from the area, although masked individuals were seen attacking the line of officers into the evening.\nOne woman, who lives locally and joined the anti-immigration protest, earlier told the BBC's Navtej Johal the scenes at the hotel are \u201cabsolutely barbaric\", adding \"this is not what we\u2019re here for\".\nSouth Yorkshire Police said no hotel staff or residents were reported to be injured and it would maintain a strong presence around the building for the rest of the day and into Monday. \nOne person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences.\nAssistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield said: \u201cThe mindless actions of those today have achieved nothing other than sheer destruction and leaving members of the public and the wider community in fear.\n\u201cWhile it was a smaller number of those in attendance who chose to commit violence and destruction, those who simply stood on and watched remain absolutely complicit in this.\"\nACC Butterfield added that people spreading misinformation and hate online \"also need to take responsibility for the scenes today,\" adding: \"This was not a protest, just angry people, reacting to a false narrative who have their own motivations for doing so.\"\nSpeaking to reporters from Downing Street, Sir Keir Starmer said those involved would feel the \"full force of the law\".\n\"You will regret taking part in this,\" he told those involved in the unrest.\n\"There is no justification for taking this action.\n\"I won't shy away from calling it what it is - far-right thuggery.\"\nHe added that the \"violent mob do not represent our country\" and said: \"If you target people because of the colour of their skin or faith, that is far-right and I\u2019m prepared to say so.\n\"Our police deserve our support as they tackle any and all violent disorder that flares up.\"\nThe Home Office announced a new \"rapid response\" security scheme for mosques \"at risk of violent disorder\". \nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"As a nation we will not tolerate criminal behaviour, dangerous extremism and racist attacks that go against everything our country stands for.\"\nWriting on X earlier, Ms Cooper had said: \"The criminal, violent attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham is utterly appalling.\n\"Deliberately setting fire to a building with people known to be inside.

    "Police forces across the country are to increase their co-operation to tackle violent disorder, Sir Keir Starmer announced on Thursday.\nIt comes after a crisis meeting with police chiefs following rioting in the wake of the Southport attack, which saw unrest spread across the country earlier this week.\nStarmer described the chaotic scenes that unfolded in the aftermath of the stabbing as the \"actions of a tiny, mindless minority\" and condemned \"far-right hatred\".\nEarlier on Thursday, a 17-year-old appeared in court charged with the murder of three children in the attacks on Monday.\nThe prime minister said the new national violent disorder programme would help clamp down on violent groups by allowing forces to share intelligence.\nIn a televised speech, Sir Keir added: \"These thugs are mobile, they move from community to community, and we must have a police response that can do the same.\"\nHe also condemned \"violent disorder, clearly whipped up online\", describing it as crime, \"not protest\".\n\"We will take all necessary action to keep our streets safe\", the PM continued.\nSir Keir said nobody involved in rioting should \"pretend they are speaking\" for the grieving families, adding that the community of Southport \"had to suffer twice\" in the wake of the stabbings.\n\"Mosques being attacked because they're mosques - the far right are showing who they are. We have to show who we are in response to that.\"\n\"These thugs are mobile,\" he added, \"they move from community to community. We must have a policing response that can do the same.\"\nThe new powers would include shared intelligence and the wider deployment of facial recognition technology.\nIt would also include more Criminal Behaviour Orders (CBO) to restrict the movement of offenders and stop them travelling, similar to measures taken against football hooligans.\nSpeaking to the BBC after a meeting with the prime minister, the chair of the National Police Chiefs Council has said further disorder can be avoided.\nChief Constable Gavin Stephens said: \"It's our job in policing to be worried about this but it's not inevitable\". He also warned those thinking of attending further riots would feel the full force of the law.\nThe police chair also urged communities to pull together - and said everyone had to play a part \"in not fanning any flames of disorder\".\nSir Andy Marsh, Chief Constable at the College of Policing, said in a statement that the emergency meeting which brought together police leaders from across England and Wales was \"to make sure that we are talking to each other, and that we can be prepared.\"\nSome of the places targeted in the widespread disorder were mosques, leading the Muslim Council of Britain to urge mosques to strengthen security during Friday prayers.\nIn a message to British Muslims who expressed concerns, the prime minister said: \u201cLet me be very clear: I will take every step that's necessary to keep you safe.\"\nOn Tuesday, Southport saw a night of unrest following a vigil in memory of the victims of the knife attack.

    "It's a warm Wednesday morning in August and mother of six, Carly, is trying to take off her front door to remove the fridge from her home. \nAlong with her 14-year-old son, she has an hour to frantically move furniture to a van before bailiffs arrive and lock them out of their house for good.\nCarly says she has nowhere to go, and does not know where she and her six children, aged between seven months and 16, will sleep tonight.\n\u201cI might have to sofa surf,\u201d she says. \nCarly has lived in this privately rented, four-bedroom house, in Enfield, north London, since 2018.  She was paying \u00a31,900 per month. \nLast year, the landlord said he wanted to increase her rent by \u00a3100 - an amount she could not afford. \nIn November 2023, a court issued a possession order but Carly says Enfield Council advised her to stay put until she received further notice from the landlord. She was given two weeks' notice of eviction.\nThe impact has been extremely distressing for her and her children.\n\u201cThe stress alone is unimaginable, I wouldn\u2019t put this on anyone,\u201d she said.\n \u201cIt\u2019s been a nightmare.\" \nCarly is one of an increasing number of Londoners facing homelessness after a private tenancy ends.  \nCurrently, a tenant can be evicted with a Section 21 no-fault eviction notice after a fixed term tenancy ends if there is a written contract or during a tenancy with no fixed end date.\nTracks have been made to change this. The previous government promised to abolish no-fault evictions but the Renters Reform Bill failed to become law before the general election. \nNow Labour is in government, it has promised to prioritise the issue of homelessness. \nRents have been rising in the UK, but in London in recent years, a demand for properties has outweighed supply and, according to Rightmove, the average monthly rent in May was \u00a32,652, a record high. \nIn the first three months of 2024, there were 4,600 households claiming homelessness support from their local council following the end of private rental tenancy, a 12% increase on the same period in 2023, campaign group Renters Reform Coalition (RRC) said after analysing government data. \nWithout a home or anywhere to settle, Carly and her children are preparing to spend the day in the local council offices to apply for emergency housing. \nGenerally, councils can only help people with accommodation once they are actually homeless. \nFor Carly, that means she's had to put all of her things in storage - another extra cost she cannot afford having had to borrow money to pay for it - and faces a long wait with her children. \n\"You wouldn't want this for anyone, it's scary for the children,\" she said. \nSarmad Dar, who has run a removal company for 10 years and has taken Carly's things to a storage unit, says the number of evictions he goes to has increased, particularly since the pandemic.\nHe says he now estimates eviction removals make up about half of his workload. \n\"These days there's too many evictions,\" he said. \n\"I believe that the reason is the rent prices are ridiculously high\". \nDeputy prime minister and housing secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cWork is already under way to stop people from becoming homeless in the first place. \n\"This includes delivering the biggest increase in social and affordable homebuilding in a generation, abolishing Section 21 no-fault evictions and a multi-million pound package to provide homes for families most at risk of homelessness.\u201d\nIn response, RRC said: \"We need to see renters' rights soon, but the government need to get it right rather than rushing it through.\"\nCarly's landlord and estate agents acting on behalf of her landlord declined to comment, but Enfield Council said that Carly and her family were allocated rooms within the day, and assigned a case worker.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An anti-immigration protest and a counter protest in Belfast city centre have ended, with both groups peacefully dispersing.\nOver the past week, sporadic violence had broken out across the city and homes and businesses had been targeted in racially motivated attacks.\nMore than 1,000 anti-racism protesters gathered at Belfast City Hall on Friday to oppose an anti-immigration protest at the same location.\nAbout 200 people gathered for it and police land rovers were moved into the middle of the road to separate the two groups.\nThere was a significant police presence in the area.\nPolice announced over loudspeaker that face coverings must be removed and failure to do so could result in arrest and prosecution.\nEarlier, Ass Ch Cons Melanie Jones told a news conference that \"from today [Friday] our officers may have additional powers to stop and search or require the removal of face coverings\".\nShe was referring to existing powers available to police within the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987.\nUnder section 23b, they have stop and search capabilities \u201cin anticipation of violence\u201d.\nBBC News did not see police officers exercising those powers in the city centre.\nA number of businesses around Belfast city centre announced early closing times in anticipation of potential disorder.\nSome shut their doors shortly after midday.\nThe grounds of Belfast City Hall were closed and its gates locked. \nLibraries across Belfast also announced early closures, and Queen's University Belfast closed its buildings.\nThe areas around City Hall, Chichester Street, Donegall Square North, West and East in Belfast have now reopened to traffic. \nPresident of the Belfast Chamber Gavin Annon said it was \"completely unacceptable\" that so many businesses decided to close early because of the threat of violence.\n\"These businesses are the heartbeat of our city, and the hard-working owners and staff should not have their livelihoods impacted while trying to carry out their jobs,\" he continued.\nHe also added that the closures projected \"a very poor and inaccurate impression of our city\" during peak tourism season. \nTranslink warned passengers that services will be subject to delay and disruption today due to protests. \nA number of services have put diversions in place and Translink have said they will \"liaise closely with the PSNI and continue to follow their guidance - and any diversionary routes in place\".\nACC Jones encouraged those protesting to do so peacefully and to follow police advice.\n\u201cOur officers will have all the appropriate tactics to tackle disorder and criminal behaviour the likes of we have seen in the past week,\" she said.\nACC Jones said police are investigating who is causing this disorder and \u201cwe will be bringing them to justice\".\n\u201cIt is time for our communities to call this out for what it is, it is not acceptable.\n\u201cThe scenes we have seen over Belfast over the past week are a disgrace.\"\nIn total police said 27 arrests have been made and 22 people have been charged to date.\nOn Friday, the PSNI charged a 61 year old man with rioting. He is due to appear before Belfast Magistrates' Court on Saturday. \nACC Jones said Police Scotland will send additional officers to boost the Police Service of Northern Ireland ( PSNI) next week.\n\"The initial deployment will give us four extra units, which is in the region of 120 additional officers deployed onto our streets,\" she said.\nShe said 10 officers have been injured so far.\nPolice will have a \u201csignificant visible policing operation\u201d in place across Northern Ireland to ensure everyone is kept safe, she said.\nOn Thursday night, bricks and masonry were thrown at police dealing with race-related hate crimes in Belfast.\nA car was set on fire on Benburb Street and the windows of a number of houses were smashed on Kilburn Street, both in south Belfast.\nIn east Belfast, bins were set on fire on Castlereagh Street.\nA group of masked men attacked police on Flora Street, but no officers were injured.\nIt follows several nights of disorder in Belfast, including racially motivated attacks.\nA number of businesses were targeted after an anti-immigration protest at Belfast City Hall on Saturday.\nThere were further incidents in Belfast on Monday when a man was left in a serious condition after his head was stamped on.\nPolice described it as a racially motivated hate crime.\nOn Tuesday, an overseas nurse spoke to BBC News NI over their fear of coming into work because of the racist violence.\nOn Wednesday, a healthcare worker's home, which she shares with her eight-year-old daughter, was attacked in Ballyclare.\nThere has been widespread disorder across the UK - which erupted after the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport - with unrest fuelled by misinformation online.",
    "A group of children have been left \"in shock\" following an incident in a Lurgan park in which they were threatened by a man with a knife.\nYouth workers who intervened in Lord Lurgan Memorial Park on Thursday evening have been praised for their actions.\nA man has been arrested following the incident, which police have described as \"terrifying\".\nSinn F\u00e9in councillor Keith Haughian said he understood the youth workers physically stood between the man and the youngsters.\nHe said the group of about a dozen children aged between 12 and 13 had been in the park for much of the day.\nThey had been doing activities with the Drumgor Detached Youth Work Project.\n\"The children were left quite shocked, as you would imagine,\" Cllr Haughian said.\n\"The youth workers probably understood the gravity of it a bit more.\n\"So it was a case of trying to get the children to calm down and obviously inform the parents. The youth workers have been absolutely fantastic and without them last night, I'm not sure what we'd be dealing with this morning.\"\nPolice located a man, who was armed with a knife, at a house in a street near the park where he was arrested on suspicion of two counts of common assault and possession of an article with a blade.\nIn a statement, the Drumgor Detached Youth Work Project said its team had been engaging with young people in the park.\n\"An incident then occurred which resulted in our staff intervening to de-escalate the situation,\" it said.\n\"I would like to praise the actions of the team who ensured that all young people were kept safe.\n\"As an organisation, we will continue to support the young people and staff who have been impacted by this event.\"\nCllr Haughian said parents in the area would have found the incident \"quite shocking\".\nHe added: \"But it's to reassure them that there were youth workers on the ground and I want to pay tribute to them, and also the police who responded very, very quickly.\n\"I want to take time to appreciate that they were here so quickly.\n\"So while it is a shocking incident, there is a lot of comfort knowing that the services were there to help.\"",
    "It is a toy that has delighted children for decades - but for one charity, Transformers really are more than meets the eye. \nA group of fans of the robots in disguise - a pop culture franchise that has spawned films, TV shows, comics and even stamps - have been hunting for rare and obscure collectables for the past 15 years.\nBut they aren't hoarding the items for themselves - they sell them on to other fans every year and then donate the proceeds to a good cause.\nSince starting in 2009, the Toy-Fu group have earned an estimated \u00a3178,000 for Mary's Meals, an organisation that aims to provide free school meals to children in countries with high levels of child poverty. \nToy-Fu was born when Nicholas Davidson, a long-time Transformers fan from Glasgow, became aware of Mary's Meals and decided to try and help.\nThe group's efforts culminate every year at TF Nation, a Transformers fan convention in Birmingham which this year runs from 9 to 11 August.\nAbout 1,500 fans of the robots from the alien planet Cybertron are expected to gather - or transform and roll out - for the event.\n\"It takes something that\u2019s very commercial \u2013 of just buying new things \u2013 and does something good with it,\" says Gavin Spence.\nThe graphic designer from Airdrie has been a Transformers fan since childhood and a Toy-Fu member for several years.\n\"Nick\u2019s the sort of person that others gravitate towards and because it\u2019s a noble cause there has been a huge influx of people supporting it and bringing their own talents.\n\"It\u2019s not just selling toys now, but making magazines, bringing in other merchandise, making their own custom toys for raffles and things like that.\"\nToy-Fu's work is not as simple as buying up some old toys and selling them.\nThousands of the robots have been released over a 40 year span. They range from the diecast metal originals of the 1980s through to exclusive toys only released in Japan and Europe, to lines based around the popular Michael Bay films and the most recent cartoon, called Earthspark.\nSome can be valuable, some much less so.\nThe Toy-Fu team scour the internet to try and find rare items they can sell to other collectors, mixed with cheaper toys for younger fans who might not quite have parental approval to spend hundreds of pounds on a toy robot.\n\"It can be really challenging to find stuff,\" admits Gavin. \n\"But we all have our areas we focus on.  One of the team, Andy, always finds really cool Japanese stuff for example. \n\"Sometimes we have to talk Nick into a higher price because he wants to raise money for the charity but also sees this as a way to service collectors in the community.\"\nThat community has given back, beyond just buying off the Toy-Fu stall each year. \nAccording to Andy Brown, another long-standing fan who works with Toy-Fu, others involved in the fandom have become involved through donating their own unwanted items, or contributing in other ways. \nThe TF Nation organisers hold a charity raffle at every convention, with funds once again going towards Mary's Meals.\n\"There\u2019s so many people that will just come up at the convention with a box and say: \u2018I\u2019ve got toys to give you for free\u2019,\" says Andy.  \n\"You\u2019re maybe thinking you\u2019ll get two or three things but these are big parcels that they\u2019re just giving us. It\u2019s mind blowing.\n\"It\u2019s like you don\u2019t really buy something from Toy-Fu, you just rent it. Then you\u2019ll give it back again years later, so this one toy can be generating money again and again.\" \nThe Transformers brand itself has been through various iterations and series over the years, but is usually centred around warring robots dived into two factions - \"heroic Autobots and evil Decepticons\" - who find themselves battling on Earth.\nFor disguise purposes the characters, with names like Starscream, Cyclonus and Ironhide, can switch to alternate forms from cars and planes to animals, weapons and - in a sign of its 1980s roots - cassette players.   \nIt enjoyed huge sales for toy company Hasbro upon launching in the 1980s, with Autobot leader Optimus Prime becoming a must-have Christmas present.\nA new animated film, Transformers One, will be in cinemas this autumn.\n\"It\u2019s like football or something, it\u2019s just always been with me,\" says Gavin.  \n\"Even in my teenage years - where you tend to say: \u2018Oh I\u2019m not into that anymore\u2019 - I\u2019d still be looking at them out the corner of my eye.\n\"Then as an adult you\u2019ve got disposable income of your own and I went right back to Transformers.\"\nMary's Meals says the donations from Toy-Fu over the years have been \"wonderful\". \nThe Argyll-registered charity began in Malawi in 2002 by feeding 200 children a day, and now works in 17 countries.\nIt estimates about 67 million children are unable to attend school because of poverty. \n\"I am so grateful to Toy-Fu and the incredible amount of money they have raised for Mary's Meals over the years,\" the charity's executive director Matt Barlow told BBC Scotland News. \n\"Their donations are providing life-changing daily school me",
    "Back when there were fewer UK television channels than non-red balls on a snooker table, Steve Davis was king of the green baize.\nHe was the player many loved to hate, with his emotionless, robotic style making him a household name who won six world titles during the 80s.\nThat same \"uninteresting\" persona was even lampooned by notorious ITV puppet show Spitting Image - a dubious honour usually reserved for heads of state, top ranking politicians and Hollywood celebrities.\nWho then would have foreseen Davis eventually rebrand as one of the country's top DJs, performing everywhere from the Glastonbury Festival to supporting Britpop giants Blur at Wembley Stadium?\nNot only that, the 66-year-old Londoner will also be appearing at the 40th Brecon Jazz Festival this weekend. \nThere he will be joined by long-time musical collaborator Gaz Williams, the duo promising an \"utterly unique\" immersive sound and light experience at the town's cathedral on Saturday, 10 August.\nBut rather than a set of turntables, both will be playing a modular synthesizer - to the uninitiated, a baffling box of switches, dials, sliders and wires - to create hypnotic soundscapes of loops, samples drones and textures.\n\"What we do isn't jazz as such, but we are improvising and that's very jazz-like,\" said Davis, who now lives just the other side of the Severn Bridge.\n\"I also used to improvise whenever I played snooker because I never knew what the next shot was going to be.\n\"So I\u2019m still doing exactly what I've done all my life really.\"\nBut, as Davis freely admitted, that still doesn't make the image of him playing gigs rather than potting balls any less incongruous.\n\"When I retired from the snooker world I started hanging out more and more with my musician friends, after which I started DJing,\" he said.\n\"I'd play classic dance bangers mostly, a bit of techno and some stuff from the good end of rock.\"\nBut then he saw someone playing a modular synth at a club in Soho and \"began disappearing down that particular rabbit hole\".\n\"I remember thinking, 'that thing doesn't even have a keyboard, so where are the sounds coming from?',\" Davis added.\n\"I decided to investigate further and got totally hooked.\"      \nHailing from near Wrexham, Gaz Williams first met the snooker icon via a mutual acquaintance at the 2016 Greenman festival in Powys.\nHe described playing a modular synth - get ready, here comes the science bit - as \"sending random voltage through different modules, which clamp and shape it\". \n\"We're channelling vibrations to sculpt something musical, and at Brecon we'll be performing three 20 minute pieces on the festival's new Mindset stage,\" he said. \n\"Each of those pieces is a rough sketch which we'll play about with and expand upon - essentially we're asking the audience to come with us on a journey and see what happens.\"\nDavis added: \"There are easier ways to play music, but therein lies the challenge.\n\"I love the fact that we're not totally in control and that much of what comes out is a happy accident.\"\nIt is certainly light years away from Snooker Loopy, the 1986 Chas 'n' Dave hit upon which Davis featured, alongside such other great players as Dennis Taylor and Terry Griffiths.\n\"I'm sure there are some who'll see me doing all this and think I've lost the plot,\" he said of his latest offbeat venture.\n\"But if that curiosity factor attracts to our shows the sort of people who might not have come otherwise, then that's great.\n\"I don't have the ego to demand anyone take me seriously as a musician.\n\"I'm perfectly happy being a bit of a novelty.\"",

    "A new mum has been unable to register her baby daughter at her local GP surgery after changes to its catchment boundary. \nJordan Wynne, 31, from Saltney Ferry, Flintshire, received all her maternity care and midwife referral from Saltney surgery, where her older daughter is also registered. \nBut when she tried to register baby Stormi, she was told her home a mile away was outside the surgery's catchment and it was not accepting new patients. \nThe surgery has been approached for comment. \nAs she is not in the catchment for any other surgery in Deeside, she has been unable to register her daughter at any GP in Wales. \nCouncillor Jason Shallcross helped Stormi get a place at Lache surgery over the English border in Chester, but Ms Wynne said while the surgery was \"sympathetic\" it had told her the arrangement was temporary as she did not live in its catchment. \nStormi has had to be readmitted to hospital twice since her birth four weeks ago with an eye infection and reflux. \n\"It has been so stressful,\" said Ms Wynne. \n\"I feel like all I've done the past four weeks is try to find a doctor for my baby when I should be enjoying being with her. They have all turned me down.\"\nOther residents on Ewart Street and nearby North Street have also been affected by the boundary issue.\nMr Shalcross and another Saltney councillor, Richard Lloyd, said they were pleased the situation had been resolved for now, but there needed to be a solution for residents. \n\"We don\u2019t want any of our residents to go through what Jordan and her family have experienced trying to register their new born baby at the local medical practice,\" they said. \nThe Saltney surgery, which is part of the Stables Medical Practice in Hawarden, has been asked to respond.\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board director of primary care contracting and commissioning Lynne Joannou said: \"We understand that residents in Saltney Ferry have had issues with gaining access to local GP services and we are sorry that this is the case. \n\"We are working with partners to review the situation to ensure there is access for local residents.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"No patient in Wales should be without access to a GP.\"\nThe NHS has been approached for comment.",

    "Spending on care placements and agency staff in Bradford will be cut after the council's newly-formed children's services body went over budget by more than \u00a342m.\nLaunched in April 2023, Bradford Children and Families Trust (BCFT), spent \u00a342.3m more than its \u00a3174.0m net revenue budget allocation in its first year.\nBCFT was set up after Bradford Council was stripped of control of its children's services in the wake of the murder of Star Hobson and consecutive inadequate Ofsted ratings. \nCharlotte Ramsden, chief executive officer for BCFT, said: \"We are committed to continuing to work together with Bradford Council to deliver improved services and reduce costs.\"\nAccording to an executive report published last month Bradford \"faces financial challenges on an unprecedented scale\".\nThe Labour leader of Bradford Council, councillor Susan Hinchcliffe, has previously blamed a lack of government funding for its overspending.\nThe \u00a342m includes \u00a332.8m on residential care placement costs and \u00a35.5m on staffing budgets due to agency workers. \nMs Ramsden said: \"It has taken time to address the pressures that already existed in relation to number of children in care and high levels of agency staff.\"\nShe added that BCFT has a three-year improvement plan to prioritise early intervention, while reducing the number of children needing care. \nMs Ramsden also said that BCFT will \"make greater use of family networks to help them keep children safe\" and \"reduce our need for external residential care through further development of our own homes\".\nShe said the trust was also making \" good progress in safely reducing agency staff\". \nLast month Ofsted noted \"notable progress in improving services for Bradford\u2019s children\".\nCouncillor Mike Pollard, who is the finance spokesperson for the Conservatives on Bradford Council, said the council had \"set a budget based on wholly unrealistic assumptions\", adding that it was inevitable it would overspend.\nMeanwhile, Councillor Rebecca Poulsen, the Conservative group leader, said: \"Many of the proposals from the BCFT to improve services to children and families are heading in the right direction but progress is slow and agency staffing levels are still too high.  \n\"Agency staffing is extremely expensive and doesn't give consistency of support to children and young people.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

Craig Moran, a major figure in gun crime in Nottingham in the 2000s who fled the country in 2018.\nA judge at Nottingham Crown Court said the groups were involved in \"the trafficking of vast quantities\" of cocaine, heroin and cannabis, and also possessed a number of weapons.\nThe sentencing hearing for all the defendants took three days and concluded on Wednesday, with Moran receiving a 24-year prison sentence.\nThe court heard the defendants were involved in the movement of Class A and B drugs between the cities to varying degrees.\nJudge Michael Auty KC said Moran was \"the head of an organised criminal group\" based in Nottingham whose \"principal and incredibly lucrative activity was the supply of controlled drugs\", with Danson his equivalent figure in the Manchester area.\nMoran \"chose to utilise trusted family and friends as much as possible\", and by avoiding discussing operations in public and on phones he was \"confident that he would never ever be caught\".\nThe court heard Danson was \"effectively Craig Moran's opposite number\" in Manchester, where he also \"recruited family and friends to maximise loyalties and minimise risk\".\nDescribing the conspiracy as \"at the very top of the scale of seriousness\", he equated the enterprise to a football club at \"mid-table of the Premier League\".\nThe judge said the gang used a series of mobile phones and EncroChat to carry out and hide their activities, which he described as \"a highly sophisticated criminal cartel\" that was only stopped \"by the intervention of the authorities\".\nDanson was recalled to prison in May 2018 but the court heard his \"involvement in this enterprise continued, in many ways undiminished\". \nMoran feared \"the net was closing in\" following Danson's recall and fled the country in August 2018, but he was extradited back to the UK from the United Arab Emirates in 2020.\nThe judge said the defendants' activities caused \"immense\" harm, adding the impact of drugs on society \"close in fact to being incalculable\".\n\"These drugs, particularly cocaine and heroin, are a blight on society,\" he said.\n\"It's almost impossible to overstate the corrosive effects of these drugs.\"\nFollowing sentencing, Assistant Chief Constable Rob Griffin of Nottinghamshire Police said the \"hefty\" sentences were \"a testament to an impressive investigation carried out by the East Midlands Special Operations Unit\".\nHe said further action would be taken through the Proceeds of Crime Act to \"seek to identify and seize any assets amounted from the running of this illicit enterprise\".\n\u201cThis was a massive undertaking by a very skilled and determined investigation team to dismantle a gang which was responsible for bringing large amounts of cocaine and heroin into Nottingham as well as firearms and ammunition,\" he said.\n\u201cIt serves as a strong warning to others who think they can run drugs operations in our city and county that we have all the investigative tools we need to take their so-called drugs empires away from them.\"\nCraig Bailey, 35, of Watkins Avenue, Salford, Manchester, was sentenced to 15 months after pleading guilty to participating in criminal activities of an organised crime group.\nDarren Bexon, 39, formerly of Huggett Gardens, Top Valley, Nottingham, was sentenced to 12 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs, conspiracy to supply a Class A drug, and conspiracy to produce a controlled drug of Class B.\nJodie Danson, 43, formerly of Edmund Street, Salford, Manchester, was sentenced to 16 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to possess, purchase or acquire prohibited weapons without authority, conspiracy to supply a controlled drug of Class A, and conspiracy to supply a Class B controlled drug.\nDean Hudson, 25, of Totland Drive, Nottingham, was sentenced to three years after pleading guilty to participating in criminal activity, producing a Class B drug and possessing Class B drugs with intent, and was found guilty of possessing criminal property.\nLee Hudson, 26, formerly of Wendling Gardens, Bestwood, Nottingham, was sentenced to 12 years after pleading guilty to possessing ammunition without a firearms certificate, conspiracy to supply Class A drugs, producing Class B drugs, possessing Class B drugs with intent and possession of criminal property.\nRichard Jones, 51, formerly of Edgeware Road, Newton Heath, Manchester, was sentenced to eight years after pleading guilty to possession of ammunition without a certificate, possessing Class B drugs with intent, possession of a Class A drug, possession of a Class B drug and two counts of possession of a firearm.\nCalum Kirk, 25, of Whitton Close, Bestwood, Nottingham, was sentenced to two years, suspended for two years, after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and affray.\nCraig Moran, 42, formerly of Reve",
    "Shop occupancy figures on what was once Aberdeen's flagship shopping street has improved back to pre-Covid levels, according to a new survey.\nUnion Street was once Aberdeen's main retail hub, but since 2009 faced competition from the Union Square complex with shops, restaurants and a cinema. \nCommercial property expert Richard Noble said from August the street level vacancy rate was down to 18%, back to where it was in February 2020. \nHe told BBC Scotland News this was a \"pleasant surprise\".\nMr Noble is with FG Burnett, a property consultancy based in Aberdeen.\n\u201cSince 2020 we have seen the percentage rise from 18% to 25%, peaking in November 2022,\" he said of the vacancy rate.\n\"Since that time the number of empty units has gradually been falling from a high of 48 to 34.\"\nHe cited factors including a \"gradual improvement in sentiment\" since the pandemic, and a more flexible approach from landlords in relation to rent, incentives and lease duration.\nMr Noble described an empty shops grant scheme launched by the city council last year as \"crucial\". \nIt was revealed last month that 10 new businesses have been helped to open on Union Street in the first year of the project.\nThe \u00a3195,000 fund covers up to 50% percent of the project costs.\nHe said it was accepted that Union Street does not look as it did in its \"heyday\", changing from being the city\u2019s main retail thoroughfare, and would continue to evolve.\nMr Noble said he was feeling more \u201coptimistic\u201d.\nHe explained: \"Given the success of the empty shops grant scheme, if a similar scheme could be introduced for upper floors that might encourage developers to show a bit more interest in these upper floors, then I think that would be money well spent.\n\"I think that would be an easy win.\"\nHe added: \"I would emphasise there\u2019s still an awful long way to go. And I think the public realm still needs to improve quite dramatically. Whether that\u2019s street furniture, planting or cleanliness of the street - there\u2019s a lot to do on that front.\"",
    "Hundreds of people attended an anti-racism rally in Guildhall Square in Londonderry on Wednesday evening. \nOrganisers said it was held to show solidarity with the migrant community of the north west in response to some of the violent scenes seen in Belfast and some areas in England in recent days.\nThere have been no such violent scenes in Northern Ireland's north west.\nDerry City and Strabane District Mayor Lilian Seenoi-Barr, who is originally from Kenya and is Northern Ireland's first black mayor, was among those who addressed the crowd.\nThe event was organised by United Against Racism Derry, as well as organisations such as the North West Islamic Association.\nOrganiser Davy McAuley said it was great to see such a large turn-out in support of people who have come from all over the world to live in Derry.\n\"This is a city united against racism,\" he told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme.\n\"Events such as these are important because Derry has a rich history of standing up for people, this is a city of civil rights.\n\"When our friends and neighbours feel threatened, we want to tell people that we won't stand for this and it won't be tolerated.\"\nLilian Seenoi-Barr told the crowd that migrants, many of whom had fled persecution and war, should be made to feel welcome. \nMs Seenoi-Barr said she was deeply concerned by the \"escalating hate crimes, Islamophobia and racism on the island of Ireland\".\nShe said she had met senior police officers, politicians and statutory agencies to reassure communities across Northern Ireland that everything is being done to make them feel safe.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the rally passed off peacefully and without incident.\nHowever, after the rally finished, police intercepted a number of individuals, some with their faces covered, on Magazine Street who were setting off smoke bombs. \nThe police said these individuals dispersed when officers intervened. \nThey said enquiries were ongoing and video footage would be reviewed.\nNo injuries were reported and no arrests were made.",
    "Former York City manager Alan Little has died aged 69, the club has said. \nLittle made more than 400 appearances as a player with Aston Villa, Southend, Barnsley, Doncaster, Torquay, Halifax and Hartlepool, before retiring in 1986. \nHe then moved into coaching at Hartlepool, before joining York City as assistant manager to John Bird. He became the club's first team manager in 1993. \nNational League side York City said their thoughts were with Little's family and friends at \"this sad time\".\nIn a tribute about his life in football, the club said in his first year as manager in the 1992/3 season, he took them into the play-offs in 4th position. \nThey beat Bury before a penalty shoot-out victory followed against Crewe at Wembley Stadium in May 1993.\nDuring his tenure, Little brought fans League Cup victories against Manchester United in 1995, and Everton the following year. \nAfter he left the club in 1999, managerial spells with Southend United and Halifax Town followed between 1999-2002.\nAlan was the brother of Brian Little, a former Premier League manager with Aston Villa and Leicester City.\nPaying tribute on X, former Aston Villa player Stan Collymore said: Sending all my love and condolences to @brianlittle912 and family after the news of the passing of Alan Little.\n\"I'm sure everyone at our club, supporters and Villa family feel the same.\n\"Rest in peace, Alan, and gaffer we're thinking of you.\"\nFormer York City striker Iain Dunn was coached by Little, before he became the club's manager. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio York Sport, Mr Dunn said: \"Alan Little will go down in York City folklore. \n\"As a coach, he achieved a lot but some of the highs when he became manager we\u2019ll never forget.\"\nHe added that not only was he a great sporting figure, he was \"genuinely a really good human\" and a \"nice guy who always had time for you\". \n\"I hadn\u2019t spoken to Alan for years and I got in touch with him a couple of years ago about coming back to York and being a guest of the club and he didn\u2019t think twice,\" Mr Dunn said. \nIn terms of coaching football, the former striker said Alan was \"very honest and didn't pull any punches\". \n\"When you trained with him in football, you did not try to tackle him,\" he said.\n\"The phrase \u2018hard as nails\u2019 was developed for Alan Little because he did not pull out of any tackles and that was in training when he had finished as a player!\"\nWith York City set to start the football season playing Southend United on Saturday, Mr Dunn believed there would be recognition of Little's achievements from both clubs.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Reporter Evan Gershkovich, former US Marine Paul Wheelan and journalist Alsu Kurmasheva are in the US now, freed from captivity in Russia as part of a historic prisoner swap earlier this week. \nBut even as the US government celebrates their return, dozens of Americans are currently being held hostage or wrongfully detained in 16 countries across the world.\nData from the James W Foley Legacy Foundation - named after a journalist kidnapped and killed in Syria - suggests that more than 40 Americans are unjustly held abroad, many of them for years after sham trials. \nMajority of the cases mentioned in the report, 78%, involved a wrongful detention by state actors like China, Iran or Russia. The rest are hostage cases by non-state actors including Hamas, which is currently holding at least five American citizens.\nBut the true figure of those detained abroad is likely higher.\nThe families of some US detainees have purposely avoided the spotlight, while others have yet to be designated as wrongfully detained by the US. \nHere's a few of the cases that we know about: \nAmong the Americans still being held in Russia are Ksenia Karelina, a 32-year-old amateur ballerina and spa employee based in California. \nIn February, Russian authorities announced that Ms Karelina - a dual citizen who was visiting family members in the country - was arrested on treason charges. \nThe charges allegedly stemmed from a $51.89 (\u00a340.43) donation to a New York-based charity that buys gear for Ukrainian emergency workers. \nFollowing the US-Russia prisoner swap, Ms Karelina's boyfriend, Christopher van Heerden, told Reuters that he was disappointed that she was not included in the deal. \n\"I'm happy for the people, the Americans, who have returned to their families,\" he said. \"This makes me hopeful. At the same time, I'm heartbroken and sad...she's not on the list.\"\nMs Karelina's trial is expected to begin next week. \nWhile the US government has not commented publicly on the case, Mr van Heerden said they were aware and sought to not \"upset\" Russian authorities before the trial. \nFreelance journalist and former US Marine Austin Tice, 31, was kidnapped in August 2012 while working in Syria. \nWhile no government or group claimed responsibility for his disappearance, US officials soon said they believed that he was being held by the Syrian government - a position they have since maintained.\nSyria's government has said it is unaware of Mr Tice's whereabouts. \nIn 2022, US President Joe Biden met the Tice family and said that the US knew \"with certainty\" that he was being held by the Syrian government. \nIn May this year, Mr Biden again mentioned Mr Tice as being \"held hostage\". \nAfter 12 years, he is now believed to be the longest-held US journalist in history. \nMarc Fogel, 63, a teacher at the Anglo-American School of Moscow, was arrested at an airport in August 2021 and charged with carrying a small amount of medical marijuana which had been prescribed in the US. \nHe is currently serving a 14-year prison sentence and has reportedly been teaching English to fellow inmates. \nIn the wake of the US-Russia prisoner swap, Ms Fogel's family said in a statement that he was \"left behind again\". \n\"Marc has been unjustly detained for far too long and must be prioritised in any swap negotiations with Russia, regardless of his level of notoriety or sobriety,\" the statement added. \nOn 1 August, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that the US was \"actively working to get his release\". \nWhen asked about the Fogel case the following day, President Biden said that \"we're not giving up on that\". \nMark Swidan, a Texas businessman and graphic designer, has been imprisoned in China on drug charges since 2012. He denies the charges. \nA later United Nations review of the charges found that Mr Swidan - who was in China to buy flooring supplies at the time of his arrest - was not in the country at the time of his alleged crime. \nThe US government considers him, along with two other Americans, as being wrongfully detained in China.\nIn April, his mother Katherine Swidan told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that the family was \"very concerned and afraid that Mark will end his life\". \nThe family has also alleged that Mr Swidan has undergone torture while in Chinese custody, including having both hands broken and his kneecaps dislocated. \n\"His leg is so swollen that they may not be able to get the brace off his leg without cutting it off,\" Ms Swidan said in a February news conference. \"He's ill. He's eating only bread.\" \nNew York native Ryan Corbett was arrested after returning to Afghanistan in August 2022 after having left the country when the Taliban swept to power the previous year. \nHe had previously lived in the country for many years, and ran and supervised projects for a number of NGOs. \nTo date, Mr Corbett has not been charged with a crime. Taliban officials have told CBS that he was involved in \"anti-state\" activities. \nHe is among three US citizens the US gove",

    "Connie Converse failed to find fame as a singer-songwriter in the 1950s, then mysteriously disappeared without a trace. On the 100th anniversary of her birth - and approaching the 50th anniversary of her disappearance - she's now remembered as a great lost talent.\nIn January 1961, an unknown Bob Dylan arrived in Greenwich Village with a guitar in his hand and $12 in his pocket, on his way to revolutionising popular music with his poetic, personal songs.\nMaybe he brushed past Connie Converse as she went the other way. She moved out of the New York neighbourhood that same month, after a decade of struggling to get significant attention for her own intimate, sophisticated and beautiful songs.\nThere is a parallel universe where Converse was the one who got the big break, and she is a household name.\nAt least, that\u2019s the theory put forward in a recent book called How To Become Famous \u2013 not a manual, but about why some talented people become successful and others stay in the shadows.\nIt imagines a world where Converse is \"widely known\" as \"the most original, and perhaps the greatest, of the folk singers of the 1950s and 1960s\", who influenced everyone from Dylan to Taylor Swift, and for whom \"a Nobel Prize is not out of the question\".\nMusician and author Howard Fishman, who published Converse\u2019s biography, To Anyone Who Ever Asks, last year, also thinks Converse could have made it big.\n\"I love to think about an alternate reality in which Connie Converse\u2019s music did receive the recognition it deserved in its own time, and she became a recognised for the musical genius that she was,\" he says.\n\"I almost think a better version of American cultural history could have happened, had that been the case.\"\nBut How To Become Famous author Cass Sunstein concedes that Converse wasn't better than Dylan. She also faced barriers because she was a woman. And perhaps her clever, melodic and mostly melancholic songs just never quite had mass appeal.\nThey dealt with subjects like loneliness, promiscuity, quarrelling lovers, and frequenting saloons in the afternoons. It's certainly hard to imagine them really catching on in the early 50s, an age dominated by schmaltzy crooners, folk purists and show tunes.\n\"She didn't sound like anybody else that was making music in her own day,\" says Fishman. \"And she doesn't sound like anybody else making music now, to my ears.\"\nBritish singer Vashti Bunyan became a Connie Converse convert after a recommendation from US DJ David Garland, the first person to play her songs in 2004.\n\"I couldn't believe that they were [recorded] so long ago, it was the 1950s,\" Bunyan says. \"And just to hear her speaking in a way that I would have always wanted to speak was very moving.\n\"She was completely ahead of her time, and it must have been very hard for her. She must have felt isolated.\n\"If she had any ambition for her songs, she must have known how good they were, how clever and funny and wonderful they were, and poetic. But other people didn't seem to recognise that kind of genius writing at the time.\"\nBunyan knows what it's like to have her music \"rediscovered\" decades later. She released an album in 1970, which has gained cult status in more recent years. She says their stories are very different, but agrees there is an allure to the idea of \"the discovery of something from so long ago\".\n\"And how lucky that she was recorded,\" she says. \"Connie was recorded by her friends, and none of those recordings were supposed to be commercially released.\n\"But it's so wonderful that they have been, that they have been found. And it makes you wonder about all the other people that weren't.\"\nConverse was recorded at the home of one of her friends and champions, Gene Deitch, but she never released any music in her time. She performed for small groups of supporters, but never played a proper concert. She made one TV appearance, but that led nowhere.\nEllen Stekert, a folk historian who was also performing in the 1950s, believes Converse was just \"too different\" to have \"made it\".\n\"I think she was wonderful. I think she was totally out of sequence of any kind of cultural impulse,\" she says.\n\"She was self-contained, and also self-isolated. It was too bad somebody could not break through that.\"\nConverse did have her supporters, but any female singer at that time needed to be backed by a man with the right connections, Stekert says. And Converse was socially awkward, and not good at self-promotion.\n\"Unfortunately, she didn't have much social understanding of things. She did not have a very good rapport, I think, with people.\n\"Evidently, she had very bad teeth and her body odour also was fairly prominent. And those are two factors in middle-class America that will make sure you don't make it any place.\"\nConverse worked for a printing company and then for the Institute of Pacific Relations. After leaving New York in 1961, she became editor of the Journal for Conflict Resolution in Michigan, and her intellectual activities, and peace",
    "Boxer Imane Khelif has filed a lawsuit over alleged cyberbullying during the Paris 2024 Olympics, which reportedly names author JK Rowling and X owner Elon Musk.\nThe Algerian boxer won gold in Paris, despite being disqualified from last year's World Championships by the International Boxing Association (IBA), after she was reported to have failed gender eligibility tests in 2023.\nHowever, the International Olympic Committee strongly defended Khelif's right to compete and ruled her to be eligible.\nHer lawyer Nabil Boudi told Variety on Tuesday that Musk and Rowling would be named in the lawsuit, following comments they made on social media.\nKhelif's participation was widely discussed online, after Italian boxer Angela Carini abandoned her Olympic bout against her after 46 seconds.\nParis public prosecutor's office told news agency AFP on Wednesday that they had launched a cyberbullying probe, following a complaint by Khelif.\nHowever, a prominent French legal blogger wrote on X that it is unlikely Mr Musk or Ms Rowling would face prosecution, as French penal law doesn\u2019t apply to acts committed outside of France against foreign nationals.\nBut prosecutors could press charges against those who sent messages on French soil.\nKhelif, along with Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, was cleared to compete in the women's boxing in Paris, having been disqualified from last year's Women's World Championships for failing to meet eligibility criteria.\nBut the IOC took a different view, strongly defending the two boxers. \n\"This is a question of justice: women must be allowed to take part in women's competitions. And the two are women,\" IOC president Thomas Bach said. \nX CEO Mr Musk and Harry Potter author Ms Rowling both posted comments about the boxer, with Ms Rowling saying Khelif was \"enjoying the distress of a woman he\u2019s just punched in the head\" following the fight with Carini.\nMr Musk shared a post from swimmer Riley Gaines which said \"men don\u2019t belong in women\u2019s sports\".\nBBC News has contacted representatives for Mr Musk and Ms Rowling for comment.\nFollowing her win, Khelif said \"attacks\" over her gender eligibility gave her victory against Chinese world champion Yang Liu a \"special taste\" after she won Olympic women's boxing gold, a year after being disqualified from the World Championships.\n\"I am fully qualified to take part in this competition,\" said 25-year-old Khelif. \"I am a woman like any other woman.\n\"I was born a woman. I have lived as a woman. I competed as a woman - there is no doubt about that.\"\nA day after abandoning her own fight with Khelif, Carini said she \"wanted to apologise\" to her opponent for how she handled the moments afterwards, when she declined to shake hands with Khelif.\nYang had also been due to face Khelif in the final of last year's World Championship - a title Yang went on to win - but Khelif was disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA) before they met.\nThe IBA said Khelif and Lin \"failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out in the IBA regulations\".\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) allowed them to compete, raised doubts about the tests and strongly criticised the IBA.\nA chaotic news conference held subsequently by the IBA did little to clear the confusion around Khelif and Lin's bans.\nChief executive Chris Roberts said the pair had \"chromosome tests\", while president Umar Kremlev appeared to suggest the tests determined the fighters' testosterone levels.\nThe BBC has been unable to determine what the eligibility tests consisted of.\nThe Russian-led IBA was stripped of its status as amateur boxing's governing body by the IOC in 2019 because of fears over its governance and regulation.\n",
    "A US funeral home where 190 decaying bodies were found has been ordered to pay $950m (\u00a3746m) to the families of the victims. \nThe Return to Nature home, in the town of Penrose, Colorado, had given fake ashes to grieving relatives instead of their loved-ones' remains. \nA judge ordered the payment in a civil case, but it's unlikely to be paid as the funeral home owners, Jon and Carie Hallford, had been in serious financial difficulties. \nNeither attended the hearings. Mr Hallford is in custody, while his wife is out on bail.\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to get a dime from them, so, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a little frustrating,\u201d Crystina Page, who hired the funeral home to cremate her son\u2019s remains in 2019, told the Associated Press.\nMs Page, who carried what she thought were her son's ashes for four years before his body was identified at the home, also said the couple's non-appearance in court felt like a slap in the face.\nThe victims' lawyer, Andrew Swan, told AP that while the couple's financial position was known from the outset, his clients wanted answers.\n\u201cI would have preferred that they participate, if only because I wanted to put them on the witness stand, have them put under oath and ask them how they came to do this, not once, not twice, but hundreds of times,\u201d he said.\nMore than 100 family members are involved in the civil case, which has been left open in case others come forward.\nThe Hallfords also face hundreds of state and federal criminal charges, including abuse of a corpse, theft, money laundering and forgery.\nThey had been offered a plea deal by state prosecutors on 190 counts of abuse of a corpse, the BBC's US partner CBS says. However, it is unclear if it still stands. \nLocated about 30 miles (48km) south of Colorado Springs, the funeral home specialised in burials where no chemicals, including embalming fluid, were used and where remains were buried in a biodegradable casket.\nIt came under investigation after reports of a foul odour coming from the property led to officials discovering 115 bodies there early last October. \nJon Hallford was accused by officials of attempting to conceal the \"improper storage of human remains\".\nGreen funerals are allowed in the state but remains must be buried within 24 hours or be properly refrigerated.\nFuneral home operators in Colorado are currently not required to be licensed, have a degree in mortuary science or even graduate high school.\nTougher legislation has been passed since the scandal erupted, but will not come into force until 2026.",

Try this,' and we are learning off each other.\n\"I'm really confident, we've got such an experienced design team on this job.

    "Shopkeepers in Swindon are concerned over a rise in thefts, and say more needs to be done in the local community to tackle the issue.\nCrime data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 14% increase in shoplifting in Wiltshire in the 12 months to March 2024.\nVince Ayris, who runs an engraving and repair shop, has launched an informal crime stopping group in the community, where shopkeepers can share information.\nThe Whatsapp group, known as 'Operation Meerkat', contains 120 members from around the community.\nMs Ayris says shopkeepers warn each other using information such as what thieves are wearing and which direction they are heading.\nHe says more should be done to support drug and alcohol addicts - who he believes are the main culprits.\n\"It's pretty rife at the moment because there's a lot of desperate people around that need to feed their addictions, and to do that, they steal from the shops,\" he said.\n\"We've got these people living on the fringes of town, so we are the hotspot for them to come to.\" \nHavelock Street is an independent road full of small businesses, which Mr Ayris says he feels \"very protective of\". \n\"I'm trying to make an honest living here and these people are scaring my customers away,\" he said.\n\"I'd like to encourage more people to come into town, but it's going to take everybody on board to do this.\n\"We need to support the businesses that are here and move forward, it's called growth,\" he added.\nAnother shopkeeper relying upon CCTV and the vigilance of the business community is Kelly Archer who runs Rowans Closet Arcadia. \n\"I had a guy come in who was 'so spiritual' apparently, but he felt the need to steal a rather large piece of crystal and walk away with it,\" she said. \n\"It was quite a special piece, I was selling it for a friend so I was even more upset for them than I was for myself.\"\nMs Archer posted a still of the footage online, and within minutes had people from the tight-knit community phoning her to identify him.\n\"He tried to give me excuses, but honestly he had none,\" Ms Archer continued.\n\"It was a random moment, he just felt like he needed to take it.\" \nMs Archer says she believes the solution to the problem is a more visual police presence to deter criminals from striking.\nWiltshire Police said retailers would now receive increased crime prevention measures, including additional CCTV coverage and officer patrols.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Pakistan's former spymaster - who was once tipped for the army's top job - has been taken into military custody.\nLt Gen Faiz Hameed has been accused of abusing his power and raiding a private property development business during his time as head of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency.\nIt is incredibly rare for someone of Gen Hameed's rank to be arrested in Pakistan, and has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with former prime minister Imran Khan.\nHe led the ISI during Mr Khan's administration, from 2019 to 2021, before taking early retirement in December 2022.\nThe two were understood to be very close during that period.\nThe army's official statement said the arrest of Gen Hameed was ordered by the Supreme Court, and that the military had now started \"the process of Field General Court Martial\".\nA court martial is a legal military hearing.\nIt also noted there had also been \"multiple instances of violation\" of the Pakistan Army Act since his retirement.\nIn an interview with the BBC, retired officer Lt Gen Talat Hussain described the move as \"unusual\" and predicted that many more arrests could follow.\nAccording to some analysts, the arrest could be seen as part of the military's drive to hold people accountable within the institution. \nThe arrest of such a high-ranking officer signals that no one is beyond scrutiny, according to Senator Irfan Siddiqi, a close ally of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.\nHowever, others suggest that this may be more about settling old scores, with indications that the current army leadership and General Hameed did not see eye to eye.\nThere is also speculation that the arrest reflects a willingness to take action against those who were seen as backing Imran Khan, even if they were outside the political arena. \nMr Khan, who has been imprisoned for more than a year and is facing numerous charges, was once closely aligned with Pakistan's military leadership.\nOpposition figures have previously accused Gen Hameed of being responsible for \"selecting\" Mr Khan for office, and was apparently so confident he was going to be named army chief he boasted of it, according to the BBC's former Pakistan correspondent.\nMr Khan's PTI party has appeared to shrug off speculation the arrest could be linked to them, with chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan describing the military\u2019s actions as an internal matter. \nThe government has welcomed the arrest.\nGen Hameed could not be reached for comment.",
    "Growing pressure on its homelessness budget means the Housing Executive does not have enough money for long-term solutions, its chief executive says.\nEarlier this week, BBC News NI spent 24 hours with a charity on the frontline of homelessness in Belfast.\nSpeaking to BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster on Friday, Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long said the executive now has 11,000 placements in temporary accommodation, compared to 3,000 before the Covid pandemic. \nIts homelessness budget has grown from \u00a312m in 2019/20 to \u00a333m last year. \n\"We think we\u2019re going to need somewhere round about between \u00a342m and \u00a344m this year,\" Ms Long said.\n\"So what\u2019s happening in front of our eyes is that the growth in demand for temporary accommodation is taking all of the resource.\n\"I've often said it's bittersweet, to be in a position where your budget increases - great - but the budget is being spent on the wrong thing.\"\nShe said the Executive had a legal duty to meet the demand for temporary accommodation, but that means the money is not going towards prevention services that have been underfunded for years.\nShe added: \"The long-term solution to this is we need to build social housing at scale.\"\nFive people have died on the streets of Belfast since charity the Welcome Organisation was forced to close its headquarters after an arson attack.\nA car was rammed into the shutters of the Welcome Organisation's Townsend Street centre on 23 July before being set on fire.\nThreatening graffiti was then sprayed on a wall warning workers they would be shot if they repaired the west Belfast building.\nMs Long said there had been three phases since the pandemic that have driven the growth in demand for temporary accommodation.\nFirstly, during the pandemic people living in informal arrangements such as sofa surfing had to move out.\nAfter the pandemic, due to the economic impact, many people lost their private rented tenancies.\nShe said the third reason was the growth in the number of people arriving in Northern Ireland.\nIn a statement, Communities Minister Gordon Lyons said: \u201cCollectively, work is ongoing to deal with both the long-term underlying causes of homelessness and those people who find themselves in immediate crisis. \n\"This is a daunting task, made more difficult by the criminal attack on the Welcome Organisation, which disrupted their vital services.\n\u201cThe attack also puts greater strain on public finances at a time when funds are scarce. \n\"However, my officials will continue to work with the Housing Executive, and wider stakeholder community, to ensure resources are directed to those most in need.\"\nMs Long said the Housing Executive had previously warned that it expects \"more visible signs of homelessness on the streets and we think that there is a risk of deaths\".\nShe added: \"It is very, very serious if we are in a position where we cannot fund those services.\n\"I have met with the minister last week, I met with the permanent secretary this week, I know that they are working very, very closely to find solutions.\n\"They have all the numbers for us, we have been very, very clear \u00a320m is what we need to fully fund the homelessness fund, plus prevention, plus some additional services.\n\"Currently I haven\u2019t been allocated that.\"",

    "Yellow warnings for thunderstorms and heavy rain are in place for parts of England and Wales as a heatwave continues.\nHeavy showers, lightning and thunder are forecast for Thursday, with travel disruption and power cuts possible. \nFlood alerts are also in place in parts of the Midlands. \nThe warm temperatures of recent days are set to continue across large parts of the UK into Friday, with peaks of 29C expected in southern England.\nFollowing the passing of Wednesday morning's heavy rain in northern England, the Met Office reduced the size of the Yellow warning for thunderstorms. \nIt remains in place for areas from South Yorkshire, through the Midlands and into much of southern England, as well as parts of eastern Wales.\nThe Met Office said some areas could see difficult driving conditions and road closures, as well as delays and cancellations to train and bus services. \nIt warned there could be damage to buildings from fast-flowing water, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds, and that the flooding could pose a danger to life.\nHomes and business could see power cuts and losses of other services, the forecasting agency added. \nDan Holley, a deputy chief forecaster at the Met Office, said the thunderstorm warning had been issued for a broad area but that not all of it would be affected. \n\"The most intense impacts are likely to be focussed on central, southern and south-east areas of England,\" he said. \n\"Here, some locations will witness torrential downpours, large hail and frequent lightning. \n\"A few places could see 50-100mm of rainfall in a few hours.\"\nIn the areas covered by the warning where storms do develop, they are likely to be slow-moving. \nLarge totals of rain could mount up in a short space of time, leading to flooding and disruption.\nThe Environment Agency has issued eight flood alerts for parts of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Loughborough. \nThe rivers affected include the Trent, Maun and Leen, with low-lying agricultural land, roads and footpaths close to small rivers and streams most at risk.\nPeople in these areas have been advised to avoid using low-lying footpaths near local watercourses or low-lying roads near rivers.\nThe humid conditions that many have experienced this week will finally lift through Friday night and into Saturday as a cold front sweeps across the country. \nIt will be fresher for all this weekend, but still pleasantly warm in the sunnier moments.\nThe UK recorded its hottest day of the year on Tuesday, when measuring stations in both Heathrow and Kew Gardens, south-west London, reached 32C (90F). \nThe Met Office defines a heatwave in the UK as \"when a location records a period of at least three consecutive days with daily maximum temperatures meeting or exceeding the heatwave temperature threshold.\"\nFor London and the surrounding region, that threshold is 28C - which has been surpassed since Monday. Temperatures had been expected to remain above that level through to Friday.\nIn south-east England the threshold is 27C, dropping to 26C for other parts of southern England and the Midlands.\nFor Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and most of northern and western England, the heatwave threshold is 25C.\nThe hot weather is expected to cool slightly into the weekend, with highs of around 23C forecast for Saturday. \nThe Met Office said there would still be a risk of isolated thunderstorms in the east and south-east of England, but that their frequency and impact would be much reduced.",
    "An ambulance full of supplies for Ukraine has arrived in time for a handover in the war-torn country despite breaking down in Germany.\nThe second-hand vehicle, loaded with apparatus including wheelchairs and crutches, was driven more than 1,300 miles (2,000km) by volunteers from a Rotary club in Northampton.\nThe ambulance was repaired by a friendly German mechanic and made its way across Poland through the night to hit the deadline.\nThe Rotary drivers said the charity workers who received the ambulance were \"ecstatic\".\nThe ambulance, bought from a dealer in Birmingham, left Great Doddington in Northamptonshire early on Sunday morning.\nSitting in front were two drivers from the Rotary Club of Northampton Becket, David Smith and Terry Atkinson.\nIn the back were wheelchairs, crutches, walking frames and winter clothing.\nMr Smith and Mr Atkinson made good progress through France and Belgium but disaster struck in Germany.\nThe vehicle came to a halt and could not be fixed by the roadside.\nThe drivers watched as the Fiat ambulance and its precious cargo were towed away.\nThe next challenge was finding a Fiat dealer in a country dominated by Mercedes and Volkswagen, but one was eventually located on Monday evening.\nThere was more bad news to come from the mechanic, who said it was too late in the day to carry out the repair.\nMr Smith said: \"We thought, 'We've lost a complete day here, we're never going to make that 09:30 deadline for Wednesday morning.'\n\"We left it with him and he told us to come back at 11:00, so we were obviously fairly disappointed.\"\nThe drivers breathed a sigh of relief when they returned to the dealership to find the split hose repaired and the mechanic reassuring them that the ambulance would make it to Ukraine.\nWith just 22 hours to cover 808 miles (1,300km), Mr Smith and Mr Anderson knew there was only one thing for it - they would have to drive through the night.\nMr Smith said: \"What we decided was, we'd do two hours on and two hours off,  refuel, grab a coffee, have some sandwiches, and take the coffee to go and drink it on the way.\n\"It was very nip and tuck because we were very conscious we'd had this breakdown, and the ambulance didn't stop, bless its cotton socks, it went all the way to the border.\"\nThey arrived at the Ukraine border at 02:30 local time and, after a two-hour delay at customs, they made their way to the village where the handover was due to take place with a couple of hours to spare.\nMr Smith said: \"We went and grabbed a cup of coffee and thought, 'We've done it.'\"\nThe ambulance was handed over to a representative from a local Rotary club who passed it on to a volunteer driver from a Ukrainian charity.\nMr Smith said: \"They were absolutely astounded, they were ecstatic, there were hugs and everything.  \n\"I get emotional thinking about it.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Nasa has again delayed a decision about how to bring home two US astronauts stuck in space on the troubled Boeing Starliner mission.\nThe US space agency said in a press conference on Wednesday that it will make a call by the end of August.\nOfficials also said that the astronauts\u2019 space suits are unsuitable to wear on the alternative spacecraft that could be used if Starliner is deemed unsafe.\nNasa also said the two astronauts were \u201cdoing great\u201d and went to space prepared for a risky mission.\nSuni Williams and Butch Wilmor travelled to the International Space Station (ISS) on 5 June, expecting to return after eight days.\nBut the Starliner craft ran into trouble when five of the spacecraft\u2019s thrusters, which help it manoeuvre, cut out on the approach to the ISS. Helium gas, which pushes fuel into the propulsion system, also leaked.\nThe problems mean Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore have to remain on the ISS while engineers carry out a high-level technical review.\nOne alternative way for them to return home is using a SpaceX craft leaving in autumn. More likely, they also could travel on a SpaceX flight early next year.\nThe latter would turn an eight-day mission into eight-month trip.\nIt is not a simple task to change how the astronauts travel back to Earth.\nOfficials said on Wednesday that the astronauts\u2019 space suits are not interchangeable. If they returned on the earlier SpaceX flight, they would travel without Space X-specific suits, which could pose additional risks to them. \nIf they traveled on the later flight in early 2025, there would be time to deliver the appropriate suits.\nSimeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University, told BBC News that either way, it seems \u201cwe are heading inexorably towards a return on Space X\u2019s\" crafts.\n\u201cIt seems that there are decision-makers at Nasa who are unconvinced that a safe return can be guaranteed,\u201d he said.\nBoeing has said repeatedly that it has full confidence that Starliner can bring the two astronauts safely home.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials were asked over and over what they might learn in the next weeks that would reassure them the astronauts would return safely on Starliner.\nThey did not answer the questions, but said a \u201cmajor discussion\u201d was happening at Nasa about how to return the crew.\nThe agency reiterated that it has \u201cconfidence\u201d in Starliner and that the machine could be used to return the astronauts home in an emergency.\nBoeing and SpaceX were awarded billion-dollar contracts by Nasa to provide commercial space flights for its astronauts.\nSo far SpaceX has sent nine crewed flights to space for Nasa, but this is Boeing\u2019s first attempt at a crewed mission.\nIt would be a major embarrassment to Boeing if the two astronauts were forced to return on a SpaceX craft, wearing SpaceX suits.\nNasa officials also said they have brought in external experts in propulsion systems to analyse data from the troubled craft.\nThey will continue analysis before making a decision.",
    "The remote Pacific Island nation of Kiribati headed to the polls on Wednesday in a general election that could hold profound implications for the South Pacific region.\nThe archipelago, which has a population of about 116,000, is viewed as strategically valuable to both China and the United States due to its relatively close proximity to Hawaii and its relatively vast claim of oceanic territory, according to experts.\nIn recent years its government has also forged strong relations with Beijing, after current long-time President Taneti Maamau shifted the country\u2019s ties from Taiwan to China in 2019.\nNow, as President Maamau seeks to extend his near decade in power, outside observers are watching and waiting to see where Kiribati\u2019s geopolitical allegiances will fall.\n\u201cIn the space of five years we've seen a very rapid escalation of China\u2019s political access, economic influence, and increasingly security access into Kiribati and the territory that it controls \u2013 a hugely significant change brought on by the incumbent president,\u201d Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, told BBC News.\n\u201cThat's the issue that\u2019s at stake: this rapid escalation in ties between Kiribati and China.\u201d\nOn the ground, Mr Sora said, the I-Kirabiti people will likely have voted based on issues affecting them day-to-day, such as the cost of living, the economy, and the \u201cpoor state of government services\u201d.\n\u201cBut internationally, of course, people will be interested in what foreign policy posture would a new government take,\u201d he added. \nWhile US efforts to establish an embassy in Kiribati stall, China\u2019s presence in the country has become increasingly tangible. In February, Reuters reported that Chinese police had begun working alongside local authorities on the ground in Kiribati.\nLast month, China donated riot control gear to the Kiribati police force, saying it was willing to \u201celevate China-Kiribati relations to a new level\u201d, according to a post on Kiribati Police Service\u2019s Facebook.\nFrom China\u2019s perspective, Kiribati has become increasingly strategically valuable as  geopolitical rivalries in the South Pacific grow, according to Mr Sora. \nIt is for this same reason that warming ties between the two nations have stoked anxieties in the West.\n\u201cUltimately the scenario that the US and allies will be looking to avoid is the establishment of infrastructure that has you seeing Chinese vessels on rotation in Kiribati, for example, or the placement of personnel,\u201d Mr Sora said.\n\u201cThe implication of the incumbent retaining power is that this trajectory continues and China increases and consolidates its strategic access to Kiribati. \n\"And that changes regional security dynamics. It adds a security overhead to the Pacific Islands region that we haven't seen for a long time.\"\nBlake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said from Kiribati\u2019s perspective, China is likely seen as a valuable development partner that can provide support against economic and climatic concerns.\n\u201cObviously a lot of these [South Pacific] countries are quite small, they're facing large climate and environmental threats, and so they need access to a range of partners to really keep building on their development. And that includes China,\u201d Mr Johnson told BBC Newsday.\nAs people on the ground in Kiribati cast their votes, he added, they might have been questioning whether their government\u2019s relationship with China is truly improving their quality of life, or negatively impacting it.\n\u201cGeopolitics always come second to the everyday needs of the people,\u201d Mr Johnson said.\nMr Sora added that in many ways global geopolitical concerns have distracted from these more pressing, everyday issues.\n\u201cYou have this competition for access and influence playing out in various ways\u2026 but one of the criticisms is that it\u2019s distracted from development partner support to traditional sectors like health and education,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to demonstrate how geopolitics has distracted from key development issues.\u201d\nVoting is not compulsory in Kiribati, and Wednesday's ballot is the first of two rounds in which citizens will select the country\u2019s members of parliament. These will be followed by the vote for president.\nThe country\u2019s last election was in 2020.",
    "From the outside, Adam Britton seemed like a passionate \u2013 albeit quiet and nerdy \u2013 advocate for animals.\nOver decades, the 53-year-old built a colourful reputation as one of the world\u2019s leading crocodile experts.\nHe swam with the apex predators in the wild, lent his pet crocodile Smaug to countless films and documentaries, and even hosted Sir David Attenborough at his home in Darwin, Australia; all the while preaching the need for greater respect for the creatures.\nWarning: This story contains details of abuse readers might find distressing\nBut Britton has now been dubbed one of the world\u2019s worst animal abusers, this week sentenced to over a decade in jail for filming himself sexually abusing and torturing dozens of dogs. Along with 56 charges of animal cruelty and bestiality, he also admitted to four counts of accessing child abuse material.\nThe news sent ripples of shock and disgust around the globe, leaving some of those who knew Britton questioning how he became the \u201cMonster of McMinns Lagoon\u201d - a reference to the sprawling property where he committed his crimes.\nSeveral described to the BBC a shy but friendly man, others an arrogant attention-seeker who took credit for work that was not his own. But there was one point on which they all agreed: when combing through their memories for clues of Britton\u2019s depravity, they found nothing.\n\u201cIt truly seems like a Ted Bundy type situation where you would never imagine such a thing being possible,\u201d former colleague Brandon Sideleau says.\nBorn in West Yorkshire in 1971, court documents state that Britton had concealed a \u201csadistic sexual interest\u201d in animals since he was a child and began molesting horses at the age of 13.\nBut beyond that, little is known about his youth in the United Kingdom.\nOn his blog, Britton said he was inspired to become a zoologist by three people - his mum, who was an \"avid naturalist\"; his biology teacher Val Richards; and Sir David, his role model.\nHe studied a Bachelor of Science at the University of Leeds, graduating in 1992, then in 1996 finished a PhD in Zoology \u2013 on the hunting methods of bats \u2013 at the University of Bristol.\nBut his dream was always to escape the UK and research crocs, he said in a 2008 interview. He\u2019d been fascinated with them since childhood and wanted to help reframe the increasingly fraught relationship between humans and the reptiles.\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t understand [them], you don\u2019t really have much hope of trying to convince people they are worth conserving,\u201d he told entertainment news site Den of Geek.\nSo in the mid-1990s, Britton turned up on the dusty plains of the Northern Territory (NT), home to the biggest saltwater crocodile population on the planet.\nThere, Grahame Webb - a pioneer in the field - took the \u201cvery, very enthusiastic\u201d young man under his wing at Crocodylus Park, a small zoo and research facility.\nBritton gravitated towards filming projects, but also took part in research, including a 2005 study on the potent antibiotic powers of crocodile blood which made global headlines.\nIn 2006, he left to start a rival crocodile consultancy business alongside his wife, and later also took on an adjunct research role at Charles Darwin University.\nOver Britton\u2019s decades in Darwin\u2019s croc research fraternity, many peers who initially thought he was shy but \u201cnice enough\u201d came to view him as an anti-social \u201codd man out\u201d.\n\u201cHe was quite up himself\u2026 so he wasn't a particularly popular person, but he was reasonably good at his job,\u201d says John Pomeroy, who organised research field work for Crocodylus Park.\nProf Webb had seen himself as a mentor of sorts, one who gave Britton his start in the industry and the opportunity to build filming expertise, but Britton burned all bridges when he quit.\nHe was an egotist who passed much of the work of the team at Crocodylus Park as his own, Prof Webb alleges, and then poached their clients.\n\u201cThere\u2019s scientists and then there\u2019s scientists,\u201d Prof Webb tells the BBC.\n\u201cHe knew everyone, and he had a lot of knowledge, but that's different. Librarians have a lot of knowledge too.\n\u201cGuys like Adam are just trying to get on the bloody news.\u201d\nMr Sideleau \u2013 who, with Britton, co-founded an attack database called CrocBITE in 2013 - tells the BBC a similar story. Britton \u201cloved to take credit\u201d for the archive but had \u201cnever contributed a single incident\u201d to it, Mr Sideleau says. He merely paid for the website domain.\nBut in the broader community, Britton and his pet crocodile became stars.\nAfter leaving Crocodylus Park, he established himself as a go-to expert on croc behaviour and made his leafy estate in McMinns Lagoon - at one point home to eight crocodiles - a global filming destination.\n\u201cHe had international standing unlike anyone else,\u201d one former friend and wildlife researcher - who asked not to be named - tells the BBC.\nWhen Sir David\u2019s Life in Cold Blood documentary series came knocking in 2006, Britton built a specialised enclosure for Smaug that allowed the programme to capture g",

    "Donald Trump has falsely claimed a crowd which gathered to see Vice President Kamala Harris speak in Michigan last week \u201cdidn\u2019t exist\u201d and an image showing it was AI generated.\nThe picture in question shows a large crowd at the Democratic presidential nominee's rally in Detroit.\nMr Trump, the Republican taking on the vice-president in November's election, said on his Truth Social platform that it was a fake and there was \u201cnobody\u201d there waiting for her.\nHowever, in multiple other images and videos, some taken by people present but also by TV news teams and agency photographers, you can see a large crowd of people at the event.\nBBC presenter Sumi Somaskanda took the picture below at the rally and says: \u201cPeople were literally packed in and the crowd stretched out onto the airfield.\u201d\nSeveral of other photographs taken at the event by Getty Images show a large crowd there.\nVideo footage taken by several independent media organisations, including NBC News and PBS, show similar scenes.\nLocal media outlet MLive covered the event and estimated that about 15,000 people were at the rally which was held at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.\nMany people who were also there posted pictures on X which showed them in a big crowd, including a Michigan state Democrat lawmaker who said there were \u201cthrongs of people\u201d.\nThe first version we could find of the photo Mr Trump has highlighted was posted on X by a Harris campaign staffer, Bhavik Lathia, on 7 August.\nMr Lathia says the picture was sent to him by another campaign official.\nThe Harris campaign confirmed this and sent us what they say was the original photo below.\nBBC Verify checked the metadata of this image, which confirmed it was taken on an iPhone 12 Pro Max device on 7 August at 18:28 local time.\n\u201cI can confirm that this was taken by Harris campaign staff and not modified by AI in any way,\u201d a campaign official told the BBC.\nThe campaign also sent us several other images taken by the same person at the same spot, including the one below.\nThis image was taken a minute earlier from the same angle, in which the same crowd is visible but covered in shadow.\nWe\u2019ve asked the Harris campaign whether the image which was questioned by Mr Trump was brightened to expose the crowds covered by shadow or changed in any other way.\nThere\u2019s no evidence that the Harris campaign edited the image to make the crowd appear larger.\nThere have also been suggestions online that several elements of the photo show it has been manipulated using AI.\nThese include the absence of a crowd in a reflection on the side of the plane, and that there is no identification number on the plane\u2019s tail.\nOn the first point, other photos taken by news agencies show the same view in the reflection on the side of the plane without a visible crowd.\nA Getty photograph taken from the reverse angle looking towards the crowd shows a clear area on the tarmac in front of the plane as Ms Harris and her running-mate Tim Walz walk away from it.\nIt is possible that the reflection on the side of the plane is mainly of this area of empty tarmac.\nQuestions have also been raised online about why there is no identification number on the tail of Air Force Two - the vice president\u2019s plane.\nHowever, the number is also absent from other pictures taken at the Detroit event, and footage of the plane at other events recently also show it without a number on its tail.\nProf Hany Farid, a specialist in image analysis at UC Berkeley, has examined the photograph using software designed to detect AI-generated images and says \u201cwe found no evidence that this image is AI-generated or digitally altered\u201d.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",
    "Real life stories have inspired many a show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe but few quite as strange as Willy\u2019s Candy Spectacular.\nProducer Richard Kraft was inspired by news coverage of the disastrous Wonka-themed event in Glasgow which was shut down by police after just one day following complaints from angry parents. \nWilly\u2019s Chocolate Experience promised ticket holders \u201ca chocolate fantasy\u201d but having paid for a \u00a335 ticket, they instead found a sparsely-decorated warehouse with a handful of hired actors.\nThe images and reactions to the disaster became an internet sensation, watched and read about all over the world.\nA month later, Kraft began working with songwriters on a show and convinced director Andy Fickman to join them. \nHe eventually managed to recruit cast members from the Gene Wilder film, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, to join the project.\nKraft said: \u201cI remember reading about it all in the US, and wondered what it was all about.\n\u201cIt looked like there was an Oompa Loompa in a meth lab.  And I\u2019m sitting there thinking: 'This sounds like a musical'.\n\u201cI had a press release before I had a show but still we had this crazy idea that we could launch it at the Edinburgh Fringe.\u201d\nFirst on Kraft's list was the so-called \"Sad Oompa Loompa\". \nAn image of Glaswegian actress Kirsty Paterson in a green wig had gone viral. At the time she said she felt overwhelmed and anxious.\n\u201cPeople forget that was done without my consent,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt was awful. I just wanted to stay in bed and hide under the covers.\u201d\nBut she decided to engage with the attention and that\u2019s when Richard came calling.\nHe asked Kirsty to play herself and a narrator of the story alongside a huge cast of musical veterans like Shelley Regner of Pitch Perfect, Cassandra Parker from Cabaret and Eric Petersen, who was able to revive the Scottish accent he used for two years on Broadway in Shrek the Musical.\n\nAlthough the producers of the show have stressed that the musical is a parody and has no association with the original event or those who own the copyright to Dahl\u2019s book, there are plenty of Wonka connections to keep fans happy.\nNot least the casting of two of the child stars of the 1971 film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. \nParis Themenn played Mike Teevee while Julie Dawn Cole played Veruca Salt.\n\u201cIf I\u2019d known there\u2019d still be so much interest, I\u2019d have lied about my age,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI retired from showbusiness 15 years ago and I never imagined I\u2019d be back.\n\u201cThose of us who are still around call it the Wonka effect. They\u2019re having a rotten day and then someone mentions Wonka and their faces light up and they\u2019re like children again.\u201d\nShe says she was angry when she first heard about the Glasgow event.\n\u201cPeople are very protective of Willy Wonka so to rip people off about what is their childhood dreams was just unforgiveable but hey, we turned it into a musical so maybe it can have a happy ending.\u201d\nKraft is more forgiving of House of Illuminati, the organisation behind the Glasgow event.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much difference between the dreams of my favourite dreamer Walt Disney and the guy who put on the thing in Glasgow. \n\"Some people have good taste, a good budget and can execute their plans but all dreamers are the same.\n\u201cThis is a celebration of dreamers. We dreamed up a story and we may end up on Broadway.\u201d\nIn February this year, hundreds of parents were persuaded to pay up to \u00a335 a ticket for the Wonka experience in Glasgow which promised \"surprises at every turn\".\nBut those who eagerly turned up at an industrial area in Whiteinch described it as \"little more than an abandoned, empty warehouse\".\nA handful of embarrassed actors tried to make the best of some sad-looking props and a bouncy castle.\nThe promised chocolate fountains and \"chocolatey delights\" were conspicuously absent.\nChildren were instead offered a half-cup of lemonade and a small ration of jelly beans.\nThe production also featured an unsettling character called \"The Unknown\" who is absent from the traditional Willy Wonka plotline.\nAs tempers rose, police were called. Within hours the event was abruptly cancelled, leaving some families unable to get in at all.\nBilly Coul, the director of House of Illuminati, later promised full refunds would be processed, and admitted that artificial intelligence (AI) was used to generate much of the marketing for the event.\nPlans for a full Broadway musical inspired by the fiasco are now well underway.\nAlthough creators originally planned a staged reading for the Fringe, the production now includes costumes and choreography to give a sense of the bigger show they\u2019d like to eventually create.\nThe story revolves around Willy holding a press conference the day after the event is shut down and \u201cdelivering a masterclass in the art of the non-apology apology\u201d. \nOther numbers include Lower Your Expectations and I Coulda Gone to Law School.\nKirsty Paterson believes the popularity of the original novel and its many spinoffs",
    "The Times reports that the government is planning to give councils the power to compulsorily - and cheaply - purchase what was previously greenbelt land to help fulfil its pledge to build 1.5 million homes by 2030. Caps would be introduced to stop landowners making too much profit from selling off land that had been ineligible for development. The paper says campaign groups are likely to mount fierce opposition to the proposals, though planners are arguing it may be the only way some councils can meet their new housing targets.\nThe home secretary tells the Daily Telegraph she believes, in the wake of the recent unrest, that Britain has lost its respect for the police. Yvette Cooper says a soft approach to justice has led too many people to think that crime has no consequences. She writes in the paper that she's not prepared to tolerate what she calls the brazen abuse and contempt which a minority have felt able to show for \"our\" men and women in uniform. Action has to be taken, she argues, to restore respect for police and the law.\nAccording to the Daily Express, junior doctors are being urged to strike again next year, despite being offered a pay deal. The paper says it's seen a video showing a British Medical Association employee telling junior doctors the aim was to \"bank\" the current deal and walk out again in April. According to the Express, the revelation has prompted Conservative MPs to accuse Labour of being too weak to stand up to \"its union paymasters\". A spokesman for the Department of Health said Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted to work with junior doctors to get the NHS back on its feet.\nThe Daily Telegraph understands that universities are poised to admit more school-leavers who failed to make their A-level grades than ever before. It says vice-chancellors are under pressure to fill places because of a funding crisis, coupled with a fall in demand from international students. A-level students receive their results on Thursday.\nX, formerly Twitter, has thrown the tech world's anti-terrorism organisation into turmoil, says the Times, for allegedly being the top platform for hosting Hamas videos. The paper says that though X is a founder member of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, its continuing membership has caused disquiet since Elon Musk took the company over to turn it into what he calls a \"free speech\" platform.\nThe Guardian carries an image of the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics. Its correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis, describes it as a dream-like, science-fiction inspired, light-show spectacular. She says the ceremony featured a mysterious, golden, intergalactic traveller who lands in a futuristic barren land tasked with resurrecting the Olympic spirit...\nAnd finally, the Daily Express, Telegraph, Mail and Times all feature a study from Nottingham Trent University suggesting horses are much cleverer than previously thought. Researchers found that when the animals were denied treats for not following a complex reward-based game they were able to adjust quickly to receive the reward. It's thought knowing how horses learn can help improve the way they are trained.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "German state prosecutors trying to solve the mystery of who blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea in 2022 have issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diving instructor.\nThe suspect has been named as Volodymyr Z by German media, who have treated the sabotage like a sensational true crime drama.\nInes Peterson, a spokeswoman for Germany\u2019s prosecutor general, declined to confirm the arrest warrant, telling the BBC that her office never commented so as not to jeopardise the investigation by giving the suspect a chance to escape.\nBut the Polish prosecutor general's spokeswoman, Anna Adamiak, in Warsaw told the BBC's Adam Easton that a European Arrest Warrant had indeed been passed to them by German prosecutors.\nWhen Polish officers went to Volodymyr Z\u2019s home in early July, he had already left the country for Ukraine, she said.\nHe had until then been living in a quiet residential area of Pruszk\u00f3w, a town near Warsaw, German media say.\nAccording to an investigation by three German media outlets, including public broadcaster ARD, Volodymyr Z was part of a team of experienced Ukrainian divers who in September 2022 hired a German yacht, sailed out into the Baltic Sea and planted the explosives, blowing up three of the four Nord Stream pipelines. \nA Ukrainian man and a Ukrainian woman are also suspected of involvement.\nIf the latest media reports are true, that a group of Ukrainian divers blew up the pipelines, it still doesn\u2019t answer the broader question of who ordered the attack. \nThere is so far no public evidence linking it to the Ukrainian or Russian state or for that matter any other country or individual group.\nFor years there have been conspiracy theories around the attack, with unconfirmed rumours that governments in Kyiv, Moscow or Washington were behind the attack. \nThere has also been speculation that Ukrainian or Russian military groups, acting without the knowledge of the Ukrainian government, might have been responsible.\nThe Nord Stream pipelines carried gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea and were a controversial and unpopular symbol of European energy dependence on Moscow. In other words it\u2019s easy to imagine motives for such an attack.\nFor years Eastern Europeans warned Berlin that this dependence on Russian gas made Europe vulnerable. \nBut successive German governments, from Gerhard Schr\u00f6der\u2019s left-wing coalition to Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative-led administrations, argued that binding Russia to Europe with energy and trade links would help both countries economically and ensure peace. \nRussia\u2019s full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 destroyed that hope and mainstream politicians across the political spectrum in Germany have now admitted they were wrong.",

    "At least 90 people were killed in Bangladesh on Sunday, amid worsening clashes between police and anti-government protesters.\nThe unrest comes as student leaders have declared a campaign of civil disobedience to demand that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina step down.\nThirteen police officers were killed when thousands of people attacked a police station in the district of Sirajganj, police said.\nThe student protest started with a demand to abolish quotas in civil service jobs last month, but has now turned into a wider anti-government movement.\nBoth police and some supporters of the governing party were seen shooting at anti-government protesters with live ammunition. Police also used tear gas and rubber bullets.\nThe total death toll since the protest movement began in July now stands at over 280. \nA nationwide overnight curfew has been in place since 18:00 (12:00 GMT).\nThe UN's human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, called for an end to the \"shocking violence\" and urged restraint from Bangladeshi politicians and security forces.\nHe expressed particular concern over a mass march planned in Dhaka on Monday, warning of a risk of \"further loss of life and wider destruction\".\n\"The government must cease targeting those participating peacefully in the protest movement, immediately release those arbitrarily detained, restore full internet access, and create conditions for meaningful dialogue,\" Mr Turk added.\nThe continuing effort to suppress popular discontent, including through the excessive use of force, and the deliberate spread of misinformation and incitement to violence, must immediately cease,\" Mr T\u00fcrk added.\nAmid calls for her resignation, Ms Hasina sounded defiant. Speaking after a meeting with security chiefs, she said the protesters were \"not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation\". \nOn Sunday, Law and Justice Minister Anisul Huq told the BBC\u2019s Newshour programme that authorities were showing \u201crestraint\u201d.\n\u201cIf we had not shown restraint, there would have been a bloodbath. I guess our patience has limits,\u201d he added. \nIn the capital, Dhaka, access to internet on mobile devices has been suspended. \nDeaths and injuries have been reported across the country, including the northern districts of Bogra, Pabna and Rangpur.\nThousands of people gathered in a main square in Dhaka and there have been violent incidents in other parts of the city.\n\u201cThe whole city has turned into a battleground,\u201d a policeman, who asked not to be named, told the AFP news agency. He said a crowd of several thousand protesters had set fire to cars and motorcycles outside a hospital.\nAsif Mahmud, a leading figure in the nationwide civil disobedience campaign, called on protesters to march on Dhaka on Monday.\n\"The time has come for the final protest\", he said.\nStudents Against Discrimination, a group behind the anti-government demonstrations, urged people not to pay taxes or any utility bills.\nThe students have also called for a shutdown of all factories and public transport.\nAround 10,000 people have been reportedly detained in a major crackdown by security forces in the past two weeks. Those arrested included opposition supporters and students.\nSome ex-military personnel have expressed support for the student movement, including ex-army chief General Karim Bhuiyan, who told journalists: \u201cWe call on the incumbent government to withdraw the armed forces from the street immediately.\nHe and other ex-military personnel condemned \"egregious killings, torture, disappearances and mass arrests\".\nThe next few days are seen as crucial for both camps.\nThe protests pose a momentous challenge to Ms Hasina, who was elected for a fourth consecutive term in January elections, boycotted by the main opposition.\nStudents took to the streets last month over a quota that reserved one third of civil service jobs for relatives of the veterans of Bangladesh\u2019s independence war with Pakistan in 1971.\nMost of the quota has now been scaled back by the government following a government ruling, but students have continued to protest, demanding justice for those killed and injured. Now they want Ms Hasina to step down.\nSupporters of Ms Hasina have ruled out her resignation.\nEarlier, Ms Hasina offered unconditional dialogue with the student leaders, saying she wanted the violence to end.\n\u201cI want to sit with the agitating students of the movement and listen to them. I want no conflict,\" she said.\nBut the student protesters have rejected her offer.\nMs Hasina called in the military last month to restore order after several police stations and state buildings were set on fire during the protests.\nThe Bangladeshi army chief, Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman, held a meeting with junior officers in Dhaka to assess the security situation.\n\u201cThe Bangladesh army has always stood by the people and will continue to do so for the interest of people and in any need of the state,\" Gen Zaman said, according to a release by the Inter Services Public Relation Directorate.\nBangladeshi media s",

We value ideas.\"\nMrs Burnell\u2019s husband, Al, who is also part of the group, said the volunteers enjoyed being able to make decisions on how the park looked.\nHe added that \"you can't have too many gardeners\".\n\u201cIf the council did get more manpower, it\u2019s a big enough park to still need us to be doing what we do as well,\" he said.\nMrs Hodson, another volunteer, said: \u201cWhen my little one was tiny, I used to come here all the time. Obviously it didn\u2019t look anything like this, it\u2019s wonderful. \n\"The playgroup comes here sometimes and the local schools come in here. So, it has lots and lots of knock-on effects as well as us just enjoying doing it.\u201d\nCouncillor Kurtis Crossland, chair of the communities, parks and leisure committee, said: \u201cThe Friends of Abbeyfield Park are a fantastic group who care so much about the site that provides so much joy to the surrounding community.\u201d\n\"As a council we work closely with groups to support them in delivering fantastic work within our parks and green spaces where we need to,\" he added.\n\"We are mindful of each individual setting, the maintenance requirements of these and what can be done to improve them. \n\"We will then develop plans with local groups to try and maximise the potential of each site.\u201d\nIt was a \u201cpleasure\u201d working with the volunteers on various projects in the park, Mr Crossland said.\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Charges at car parks across Exeter could be increased to help the city council balance its books.\nThe leader of Exeter City Council said he recognised the impact on city centre shops but needed extra revenue to deal with inflation.\nInExeter, which represents city centre traders, said car parking prices affected \"people's willingness to come into the city\".\nOne shopper said the car parking charges were already \"extortionate\".\nA report to be discussed by Exeter City Council on Tuesday recommends increasing the cost of city centre car parks by 40p so that a two-hour stay would increase from \u00a34.50 to \u00a34.90.\nThe cost of an all-day stay would increase from \u00a318.00 to \u00a318.40.\nThe council is also considering setting up a car park on part of the old bus station site.\nIt is also looking at introducing charges where parking was previously free, such as the Riverside Leisure Centre, but parking would still be free for leisure centre members.\nPhil Bialyk, the leader of the Labour-run council, said: \"Charges are going up for everybody in every walk of life at the moment unfortunately.\n\"Inflation has hit us all hard. We want to make some improvements to the car park estate - we need money to do that.\n\"Cars are still important but we'd like to see them reduced a little bit - there's walking, cycling, all these other options.\"\nUnder the proposals the minimum stay could be reduced from two hours to one at some car parks away from the centre and Sunday charges would stay the same to encourage Sunday shoppers.\nNicola Wheeler is the chief executive of InExeter - the business improvement district for the city that represents more than 670 businesses.\nShe said: \"We recognise that car parking charges are one of the factors that are impacting on people's willingness to come into the city and ultimately that impacts business as well.\"\nMs Wheeler said she did not want to see charges increased but recognised car park income was needed to fund council services in the city.\nShe said the council needed to take a \"long-term view\" that did \"not prohibit people from coming in the short-term\".\nOne man who had parked in Bampfylde Street car park, who did not give his name, said the prices were \"pretty extortionate\" currently and any increases would be \"unfair\".\nEllie Jones, a student who had just parked in the same car park, said she thought the current prices were already putting people off driving into the city.\nShe said: \"With the way they are charging me at the moment I don't think I'll be using my car very often.\"\nExeter City Council will meet on Tuesday to discuss the report and set the terms of a full public consultation into parking charges which is expected to be completed by October.\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "An artwork appearing on the shutters of London Zoo has been confirmed as the latest and final image in Banksy's surprise animal art trail across the capital.\nIt shows a gorilla lifting the shutter to release a sea lion and birds, while other animals appear to look on from the inside.\nIt is the ninth Banksy to appear in as many days in London and follows images that have popped up each morning since 5 August of a goat, elephants, monkeys, a wolf, pelicans, a cat, piranhas and a rhinoceros.\nA London Zoo spokesperson said it was \"absolutely brilliant\" and said the work would be preserved.\nDaniel Simmonds, London Zoo's animal operations manager, said: \"Banksy has become part of the London scene and it\u2019s really nice to share his iconic status with, ultimately, one of the most iconic zoos in the entire world.\n\"We\u2019re quite honoured he's chosen to use our front shutters this morning to put one of his incredible artworks.\n\"I think it\u2019s absolutely brilliant,\" he told BBC News.\nHe said staff had no idea Banksy was planning the work at this location.\n\"That's part of the amazing enigma of Banksy and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so exciting to come in this morning,\" Mr Simmonds added.\n\nSecurity guards have been brought in to secure a barrier that has been put up around the mural.\nMr Simmonds said the shutter would remain closed today and two others used instead, so that visitors could look at the work.  \n\"It\u2019s really important we share this with everybody.\"\nHe added he was expecting extra people to visit on Tuesday in addition to the thousands who had already booked.\n\"It's going to be a busy day.\"\nMr Simmons later confirmed that the artwork would be protected.\n\"We'll definitely preserve it. We might even look at putting some perspex around it. \n\"The last thing we want with typical London weather, having just come through one of the worst winters ever, is to see this damaged by the weather.\"\nHe added it was likely to remain in the same location for the immediate future but might then be relocated to elsewhere on the site.\nThe pledge to protect the latest image follows the removal or partial defacing of several other works in the series.\nBanksy's depiction of a rhinoceros mounting a Nissan Micra with a traffic cone on its bonnet in Charlton was seen being sprayed with a white dollar and \"v\" sign on Monday, soon after it was unveiled.\nRoyal Borough of Greenwich said it was \"a real shame that a mindless vandal has defaced the mural, which has already drawn visitors and brought so much joy to many.\n\"The council is now considering what would be reasonably possible for the future of the artwork and will be closely monitoring it.\"\nA worker has since been seen installing a protective cover over the mural on Westmoor Street.\nThe car and traffic cone have been removed. However, it is not known why or who was responsible.\nLast week, a satellite dish with a picture of a howling wolf on it - the fourth image in the series - was apparently stolen from a garage roof in Peckham.\nAnd a disused billboard in Cricklewood that featured Banksy's image of a stretching cat - the sixth image of the series - was taken down for safety reasons. \nThe BBC has been told by Banksy's team the latest work is the final piece of the series, which has captured the attention of Banksy followers for more than a week.\nThe artist appears to have installed the works overnight at each occasion.\nCrowds have been seen gathering after passers-by have spotted the works each morning, with many posting photos on social media.\nTypically, Banksy has confirmed he is behind the creations at 13:00 BST each day, however, he announced the latest work on his Instagram page on Tuesday morning.\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Windows were smashed as disorder broke out.\nLater in the evening, disorder continued in the city centre, with shops being broken into and damaged.\nHumberside Police said three officers were believed to have \"suffered injuries\" and the force was continuing to deal with anti-social behaviour and disorder.\nCh Supt Darren Wildbore said: \u201cWe currently have a high policing presence whilst officers respond to disorder that is taking place in the area of Ferensway following a protest that began this afternoon.\n\u201cOur officers have faced eggs and bottles being thrown and have made four arrests relating to public order offences.\n\"We have also issued a dispersal order for the area and there will remain a visible police presence as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those in the community.\"\nHe said officers had \"not deployed tear gas contrary to speculation in the media\".\n\u201cI continue to advise members of the public to avoid the area at this time,\" he added.\nIn a social media post, a disturbance was captured in neighbouring streets on a TikTok Live video, showing cars on fire.\nAbout five vehicles have been set alight in a customer car park at a carpet business.\nDisorder then shifted back into the city centre at about 18:00 BST.\nA BBC reporter witnessed looting taking place, stores being damaged, including the O2 shop, Greggs and Shoezone, with the latter set on fire, and other items in the street also set alight.\nShops in the city centre closed early and public transport was also affected. \nHull Interchange closed, with Stagecoach confirming its buses were unable to get into the city centre station.\nEast Yorkshire bus company also released a statement.

    "Two teenagers have been found guilty of carrying out an arson attack which caused \u00a315m of damage to a historic West Yorkshire mill.\nMcKenzie Motron, 18, from Bradford, and a 17-year-old who cannot be named, caused the blaze which destroyed the Genappe Mill in the Grade II* Listed Dalton Mills complex in Keighley, on 3 March 2022.\nThey had denied arson charges but were convicted after a trial at Bradford Youth Court.\nThey were released on bail for reports to be compiled and told to return to the same court on 7 October for sentencing.\nThe court was told how the pair were among five youths who got inside the mill through a window just before lunchtime.\nThey were inside Genappe Mill for just under eight minutes.\nIt was privately owned at the time and used for filming TV series including Peaky Blinders and Downton Abbey.\nThere were two polystyrene gargoyles, one smashed into bits, lying on the floor and these were soon set on fire, the court heard.\nMobile phone footage shot by Motron and the 17-year-old, which police later seized, showed a small fire and a person kicking bits of polystyrene towards the flames. \nCCTV footage from a nearby garage was used to identify the suspects who were arrested a day later.\nBoth initially denied being at the mill but later changed their stories, admitting they had gone to the mill to smoke a joint.\nThe 17-year-old originally told police it was Motron who started the fire but both changed their stories in court, saying they did not know who was responsible. \nJudge Alex Boyd said the combination of CCTV and mobile phone footage, the seizure of clothing worn by both teenagers on the day and their conflicting stories had satisfied him that they were both guilty of arson.\nMore than 20 fire crews from West and North Yorkshire plus other specialist fire appliances spent three days battling the blaze which the court was told caused \u00a315m of damage.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Elon Musk's X/Twitter is suing a group of advertisers and major companies, accusing them of unlawfully agreeing to \"boycott\" the site.\nIt has filed a claim against the food giants Unilever and Mars, private healthcare company CVS Health, and renewable energy firm Orsted - along with a trade association called the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) - in a Texas court.\nX claims they have deprived it of \"billions of dollars\" in revenue.\nLegal experts say the case is unlikely to succeed as any collusion or agreement between companies will be hard to prove.\nThe lawsuit relates to the period in 2022 just after Mr Musk bought X, then known as Twitter, when advertising revenue dived.\nSome companies had been wary of advertising on the platform as concerns rose that its new owner was not serious enough about removing harmful online content.\nIn the year after Mr Musk bought what was formerly Twitter, advertising revenue slumped by more than half.\nX chief executive Linda Yaccarino said: \"People are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is constricted. No small group of people should monopolise what gets monetised.\"\nShe said the alleged \"boycott\" threatened the company's \"ability to thrive in the future\".\nMr Musk tweeted: \"We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words. Now, it is war.\"\nThe WFA and the accused companies have not responded to requests for comment. \nLegal experts have suggested the case is unlikely to succeed.\n\"As a general rule, a politically motivated boycott is not an antitrust violation. It is protected speech under our First Amendment,\" said Bill Baer, who was assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice's antitrust division under former US president Barack Obama.\nChristine Bartholomew, an antitrust expert and professor at University at Buffalo's law school said X needed to show there was an \"actual agreement to boycott joined by each advertiser\", which she said would be \"no small hurdle\" to prove.\nEven if the case succeeds, the social media site cannot force companies to buy advertising space on the platform.\nX is seeking unspecified damages and a court order against any continued efforts to conspire to withhold advertising spending.\nIn its lawsuit, X alleges that the accused firms unfairly withheld spending by following safety standards set out by a WFA initiative called Global Alliance for Responsible Media (Garm). \nGarm's stated aim is to \"help the industry address the challenge of illegal or harmful content on digital media platforms and its monetisation via advertising\".\nBy doing this, X claims the companies acted against their own economic self-interests in a conspiracy against the platform that breached US antitrust, or competition, law.\nProfessor Rebecca Haw Allensworth, of Vanderbilt University, said the boycott \"was really trying to make a statement about X's policies and about their brands\". \n\"That's protected by the First Amendment,\" she said.\nX said in its lawsuit that it has applied brand-safety standards that are comparable to those of its competitors and \"meet or exceed\" those specified by Garm.\nIt also said X has become a \"less effective competitor\" in the sale of digital advertising.\nThe video-sharing company Rumble, which is favoured by right-wing influencers, made similar claims in a separate lawsuit against the World Federation of Advertisers on Tuesday.",

    "Ukraine's top commander has said Kyiv's forces control 1,000 sq km of Russian territory as they press their biggest cross-border incursion in two-and-a-half years of full-scale war.\nCommander Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukraine continued to \"conduct an offensive operation in the Kursk region\" seven days after it began.\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had brought war to others and now it was coming back to Russia.\nBut Russian leader Vladimir Putin described the offensive as a \"major provocation\" and ordered Russian forces to \"to kick the enemy out of our territory\".\nA growing number of people have been evacuated from the western Russian region for their safety, with a further 59,000 told to leave.\nThe acting governor of Kursk region, Alexei Smirnov, said during a meeting with President Putin that 28 villages in the area had fallen to Ukrainian forces, that 12 civilians had been killed and that \"the situation remains difficult\".\nUkrainian troops launched their surprise attack last Tuesday, advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into Russia. \nThere was some scepticism at the Ukrainian commander-in-chief's assertion that his forces now controlled as much as 1,000 sq km of Russian territory. The US-based Institute for the Study of War think tank did not believe all the area was under Ukrainian control.\nAlexei Smirnov said the Ukrainians told the Russian leader that the Ukrainians had advanced 12km into Russian territory and that the width of the push was 40km.\nThe offensive is said to have boosted morale on the Ukrainian side, but analysts say the strategy brings fresh dangers to Ukraine.\nA senior British military source, who asked not to be named, told the BBC there was the risk that Moscow will be so angered by this incursion that it could redouble its own attacks on Ukraine\u2019s civilian population and infrastructure.\nIn comments aired on state television, President Putin said on Monday: \"One of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord, strife, intimidate people, destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society.\n\"The main task is, of course, for the defence ministry to dislodge the enemy from our territories,\" he told a meeting of officials.\nMr Smirnov said 121,000 people had been evacuated from their homes. He told Mr Putin that about 2,000 Russian citizens remained in areas occupied by Ukrainian forces in the area.\n\"We don't know anything about their fate,\" he said.\nHe warned people to take shelter from missiles in rooms without windows and with solid walls.\nIn Belgorod, the region next to Kursk, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Tuesday that 11,000 people had left the Krasnoyarsk district closest to the border.\nHe earlier warned that the entire region was on missile alert and told people to shelter in their basements.\nIn his nightly address, Ukraine's president acknowledged the offensive, saying: \"Russia must be forced to make peace if Putin wants to fight so badly.\"\n\"Russia brought war to others, now it's coming home. Ukraine has always wanted only peace, and we will certainly ensure peace,\" Mr Zelensky added.\nUkrainian officials have said thousands of troops are engaged in the operation, far more than the small incursion initially reported by Russian border guards.\nAn official told news agency AFP that their aim was \"to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia\".\nSpeaking to the BBC's Newshour programme, Kurt Volker, a former US Ambassador to Nato, said Ukraine's incursion could cost President Putin politically at home.\nHe said Ukraine's incursion into Russian territory had happened \"because of President Putin and the way he's conducted this war.\"\n\"That is not going to be lost on the elites in Russia. It's not going to be lost on the public. Putin has provoked attacks on the Russian territory itself and people are having to be evacuated. That's quite something.\"\nDuring a meeting with Mr Zelensky in Kyiv on Monday, US Senator Lindsey Graham called the cross-border operation \"brilliant\" and \"bold\", and urged the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs.\n\nSome in Russia have questioned how Ukraine was able to enter the Kursk region - with one pro-Russian war blogger, Yuri Podolyaka calling the situation \"alarming\".\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said a tough response from Russia's armed forces \"will not take long\".\nRussian ally Belarus said it was bolstering its own troop numbers at its border after claiming Ukraine had entered its airspace with drones.\nMeanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency said late on Monday it had inspected a damaged cooling tower at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine following a fire on Sunday, but could not immediately find the cause. \nMr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately starting the fire in order to \"blackmail\" Ukraine, while Zaporizhzhia's Kremlin-installed regional governor has said it was caused by Ukrainian shelling.

    "Pieces of ironstone which may have been part of Northampton Castle, where Thomas Becket was tried, have been found in a car park.\nThe objects were uncovered in Northampton's Chalk Lane Car Park, which is being turned into a heritage park.\nThomas Becket, who was Archbishop of Canterbury, was put on trial for contempt of royal authority at the castle in 1164.\nHe was assassinated in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170, but historians have long debated whether this was on the orders of King Henry II.\nBuilding work started on Northampton Castle in 1084 under the supervision of the Earl of Northampton, Simon de Senlis.\nIt was a stronghold of the barons during their war against King John, who gave it to one of his loyal soldiers after claiming victory.\nIt features heavily in Shakespeare's play, King John.\nKing Charles II ordered it to be rendered useless as a defensive castle after it was used by the parliamentarians in the English Civil War.\nWhat was left of the structure was destroyed to make way for a railway line into Northampton.\nThe ironstone was found during excavations by the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) in preparation for heritage timeline poles being installed at the site.\nIt was mixed with brick and modern pottery and located next to the trenches dug by archaeologists in the 1960s. \nThis suggests it is the remains of rubble removed by archaeologists during the previous excavations, more than 50 years ago.\nThe archaeologists also uncovered remains of a post-medieval wall belonging to a house built in the area while the castle ruins still stood. \nDan Lister, cabinet member for local economy at Conservative-controlled West Northamptonshire Council, said: \u201cThe council has long held ambitions to redevelop this area of the town to create a heritage park.\n\"It is great to be working with experts at MOLA to uncover the fascinating history in this part of our town.\"\nSimon Markus, a project manager at MOLA, said: \u201cAs someone born and raised in Northampton, having the chance to excavate around such an important part of the town\u2019s history is incredible. \n\"Seeing how the area developed over the centuries gives a greater understanding of the town\u2019s past and the people who lived here.\u201d\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Ambassadors from Western countries including the United States and the United Kingdom will not attend a ceremony marking the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki after Israel was snubbed. \nThe mayor of the south-western Japanese city, Shiro Suzuki, said on Thursday that Israel not being invited to attend was not politically motivated but added there would be no change to the decision. \nThe remarks come a day after it was revealed that the ambassadors of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the US and the European Union had sent a letter to Nagasaki in mid-July saying \"it would become difficult for us to have high-level participation\" in the event if Israel was excluded. \nThe bomb dropped on Nagasaki on 9 August 1945 is thought to have killed about 74,000 people, both from the explosion itself and later from radiation.\nIt came three days after the first bomb dropped on Hiroshima and six days before Japan's surrender in World War II.\nMr Suzuki said security reasons, including potential demonstrations, were behind his decision not to invite Israel to the commemoration ceremony. \nBut he said he regretted the ambassadors' decision.\n\"It is unfortunate that they have communicated to us that their ambassadors are not able to attend,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the British embassy in Tokyo confirmed to the BBC that ambassador Julia Longbottom would not attend the ceremony in Nagasaki. \nAmbassador Longbottom had said that the decision not to invite Israel created an unfortunate and misleading equivalency with Russia and Belarus - the only other countries not invited to this year's ceremony. \nUS Ambassador Rahm Emanuel will also not attend. An embassy statement said the mayor of Nagasaki politicised the event by snubbing Israel.\nA spokesperson told the BBC the ambassador would instead go to a peace ceremony at a temple in Tokyo.\nIsrael's ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, who was invited to and attended a memorial ceremony in Hiroshima on Tuesday, said Nagasaki\u2019s decision \"sends a wrong message to the world\".\nIn June, Mr Suzuki said Nagasaki had sent a letter to the Israeli embassy calling for an \"immediate ceasefire\" in Gaza.\nIsrael's massive military offensive in Gaza has led to the deaths of almost 40,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says.\nIt was triggered by  the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages.

The two first appeared on stage together in an acclaimed productin of the Moliere play The Miser in 1971.\nHe went on to act with and direct Fulton in his TV sketch show Scotch and Wry and its spin-offs featuring the character Reverend IM Jolly.\nRon Bain was born in Grangemouth and trained at the then Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD). \nHe made his television debut alongside the actor Roddy McMillan in the gritty BBC Scotland drama The View from Daniel Pike in 1971.\nHis long career as a character actor included appearances in Play of the Month in 1975 as well as The XYY Men, Taggart and The Tales of Para Handy.\nHe was perhaps best known from his appearances in a series of 1980s comedies which came out of BBC Scotland's Comedy Unit.\nThese included A Kick of the 80s, Laugh I Almost Paid My Licence Fee, City Lights, Naked Radio and its successor Naked Video. \nThe latter launched the career of actor Gregor Fisher and the two also worked on the programmes Rab C Nesbitt and Snoddy.\nBain moved behind the camera during this period, working as a producer and director on a wide range of comedy and drama programmes including The Bill, River City and the Karen Dunbar Show. \nHe continued to work in theatre too, appearing onstage and encouraging other actors into the business. \nPosting on X, the actor Colin McCredie wrote: \"A dear friend for over 40 years.

I don't understand why we're going down this blind alley.\n\"It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me.\"\nEarlier in the week, Mr Davies shared a photo on X from the Vale of Glamorgan Show, showing how people were being asked to drop a ball into one of two buckets to highlight whether they wanted to abolish the Senedd or not, which he admitted was an \"unscientific poll\".\nResponding to criticism on X, Mr Davies said: \"We're just keen to find out people's views. It's important to find out what people think.\"\nLord Bourne also questioned why Mr Davies had raised an issue of the availability of  non halal food in Welsh schools, prompting the Welsh Tory leader to be accused of engaging in \"Islamophobic race-baiting\" by the Muslim Council of Wales.\nLord Bourne said: \"We do have to make clear that we're a one nation party.\"\nIn response, Mr Davies said: \"Welsh Conservatives stand against all forms of racism, including anti-Muslim hatred.\n\"Representations from across Wales have been made to me about the availability of non-halal meat in schools.\n\"These are legitimate queries and I make no apologies for taking them forward.\n\"It is important to have these discussions in a measured way and we will continue to do so.\"\nLord Bourne called for Conservative Members of the Senedd (MSs) to have a group meeting to discuss its \"one nation\" stance despite Welsh Parliament being in recess.\nHe went on to say that his party's \"focus should be how are we going to make things better for the people of Wales\" after the Conservative general election wipe-out in Wales and with the Reform party setting their sights on the Senedd elections in 2026.\n\"I think there's a great danger of talking Reform up,\" he added. \n\"We've had UKIP before, and they were represented in the Senedd previously, and then it fizzled out.\n\"The exposure that Reform is going to get now that they've got elected politicians in Westminster may well show what a busted flush they are.\n\"We're not that party. \n\"We're a party of the moderate right, and that should be reflected in the way we approach politics in Wales.\"",

The Conservative leadership hopeful accuses Sir Keir Starmer of \"doing nothing\" to \"stop the boats\".

One backbencher tells the paper that the website has become a \"megaphone for foreign adversaries and far-right fringe groups\" with an unnamed government minister saying they have cut down on posting on the site and are \"reluctant to return\".\nAnd the Times reports on the dying out of an age-old British tradition - a trip to the pub after work.  It highlights research by the think tank, the Work Foundation, which suggests that remote working, and a tendency among some younger employees to remain sober, mean that companies should instead host \"breakfast socials and away days\".

    "Stargazers across Ireland and Great Britain are in for a celestial treat as the annual Perseid meteor shower is expected to peak this weekend.\nThe dazzling display is renowned as one of the most spectacular meteor showers of the year.\nThey happen typically between 27 July and 23 August.\nThis year, the peak occurs on 11 and 12 August.\nDuring these peak times, skywatchers in dark locations can expect to see up to 100 meteors per hour, according to Astronomy Ireland.\nIts chairman, David Moore, told BBC News NI: \u201cThis year\u2019s Perseids promise to be especially remarkable, as there will be no interference from the moon.\u201d\n\u201cThis will ensure optimal viewing conditions for those hoping to catch a glimpse of the shooting stars.\u201d\nAccording to David, the meteors should be easy to see as \u201cno special equipment is required to enjoy the show - just a clear view of the night sky and some patience\u201d.\nThe Perseid meteors are fragments from Comet Swift-Tuttle, a distant comet that takes 130 years to orbit the Sun.\nAs Earth passes through the trail of debris left behind by the comet, tiny particles burn up upon entering our atmosphere, creating bright streaks of light that race across the sky.\nObservers are advised to find a dark, open area away from city lights with the meteors visible throughout the night.\nTerry Moseley from the Irish Astronomical Association said: \"Most burn away at a height of about 80-100km in the upper atmosphere, but bigger ones can penetrate a bit lower before finally burning up. \n\"Believe it or not, the brighter ones are only the size of a grape pip, and a really bright one would be only the size of a pea!\"\nHowever, conditions need to be ideal and will be different each year depending on the phase of the moon and of course the weather.\nA full moon hampers viewing due to light pollution and this year is only a quarter.\nA bit bright at first but Terry Moseley said the moon will set later in the night and that will be the best time to view. So may be worth the wait.\nUnfortunately, like with much of the summer, the weather isn't playing ball - the 11th and 12th August look unsettled.\nFor best viewing, wrap up, get a reclining chair to avoid neck strain and allow your eyes around 10 minutes to adjust to the night sky.\nThey are fast and sporadic so do not depend on getting the perfect snap. \nJust enjoy if you get the chance.\nThere should be some viewing opportunities for a time on both Sunday and Monday nights.\nHowever, data suggest the best viewing time on Sunday will be during the first half of the night before cloud and rain move in from the west.\nSimilar conditions are expected on Monday night, with the best of the clearer skies during the first half the night, into the early hours of Tuesday.",

    "Blue-green algal blooms in Lough Neagh could have a profound ecological impact and present potentially significant environmental and public health risks, researchers at Queen\u2019s University Belfast (QUB) have found.\nTheir work has confirmed the lough\u2019s hypertrophic status \u2013 the worst category of waterway nutrient pollution.\nMore than 80% of the bacterial DNA tested from algal mats belonged to potentially hazardous microbes, including E.coli, salmonella and 11 others that can cause human illness.\nThe scientists tested samples from mats of algae at Toome Lock, Rea\u2019s Wood, Antrim Boathouse and Ram\u2019s Island in the East of the Lough in 2023.\nThey found the samples to be \u201cdominated\u201d by bacteria associated with wildfowl or livestock faeces or human-effluent wastewater treatment.\nAnd they detected a large array of toxins, including one that has not been discovered on the island of Ireland before.\nDr Neil Reid from the Institute of Global Food Security at the school of biological sciences in QU,  was the lead author of the report, said farmers had a key role in addressing the problem.\n\u201cTechnological solutions to better use slurry, for example, through anaerobic biodigestion, as well as good on-farm wastewater management is needed urgently on most farms,\" he said.\n\u201cSo-called \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019 such as planting vegetation and leaving buffer strips along waterways or creating drainage swales, willow plantations and reedbeds could dramatically reduce the environmental footprint of farming avoiding any conflict with the productivity and profitability of the agriculture sector.\u201d\nHe called for government to support a \u201cjust transition\u201d for the agricultural sector, through agri-environment subsidies.\n\u201cRecent national and local political change should foster optimism that the environment and opportunities for change now exist,\" he said.\nThe study, published in the journal Environment International, found the hazardous algal bloom (HAB) that developed in 2023 was \u201can unprecedented environmental perturbation to an internationally important ecosystem\u201d, likely due to a combination of excess nutrient in the water, climate change and the effects of invasive species.\nIt says \u201csignificant investment\u201d would be needed in wastewater infrastructure and in-lake remediation strategies.\nA Lough Neagh action plan is in place to address the challenges facing the largest body of freshwater in these islands.\nIt includes a research programme to test potential solutions to the blue-green algal crisis.",

    "The number of overseas workers, students and their families applying for visas to come to the UK has fallen by a third over the last 12 months.\nThe sharp decline follows rule changes, introduced by the Conservative government, which banned most international students and health and social care workers bringing family to the UK.\nProvisional figures from the Home Office suggest the number of migrants and their family members applying for the visas fell from around 141,000 in July 2023 to 91,000 last month. \nThere was a particularly big drop in the numbers applying for health and care worker visas which dropped by 80% to 2,900. \nThe Home Office said it would \"ensure we train up our homegrown workforce and address the shortage of skills\".\nA spokesperson for the department said that immigration brought \"many benefits to the UK, but it must be controlled and delivered through a fair system\". \nNadra Ahmed, executive co-chairman of the National Care Association said the sector had started to see some staff return home or move to countries with \"a less hostile environment around immigration\". \nSpeaking to the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme, she said: \"If we had a domestic workforce willing to work then we wouldn\u2019t need these international recruits.\"\nShe added it would \"take a few years\" to build up a domestic workforce and warned that vacancies in the sector could rise to unsustainable levels. \nThe reduction in international students applying for visas could also hurt universities already facing financial pressures.\nThe Migration Observatory says the decline in student visa applications could partly be down to country specific factors such as the Nigerian currency crisis. \nNew rules introduced by former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a bid to reduce immigration levels down from record highs also appear to have caused a decline in visa applications. \nIn 2022, legal net migration soared to 764,000, but fell by 10% the following year. The Office for National Statistics says it was \"too early to say if this is the start of a downward trend\". \nIn 2021, the immigration rules for care workers had been relaxed to ease recruitment problems following Brexit. \nTwo years later, then-Home Secretary James Cleverly announced that the government would ban care workers from bringing family dependants to the UK, as part of efforts to reduce net migration numbers. \nThat came after a previously-announced ban on most overseas students bringing dependents with them. Visas issued to student dependants had risen dramatically from around 16,000 in 2019 to 135,000 in 2022. \nThe government also increased the minimum salary for skilled overseas workers wanting to come to the UK from \u00a326,200 to \u00a338,700. \nTo qualify as a skilled worker, applicants need to accrue 70 points under the points system introduced in 2020.\nPoints can be gained in different ways including by having a job offer in a sector with shortages or holding a PhD. \nThe Migration Observatory think tank said the Home Office's most recent data did not demonstrate any \"clear impact\" from the higher salary threshold.\nThe previous government had also proposed raising the salary someone would need to earn to bring family members to the UK from \u00a318,600 to \u00a338,700.\nFollowing a backlash it reduced the threshold to \u00a329,000 and said further increases would be introduced at an unspecified date.\nLast month, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the new Labour government would keep the threshold at \u00a329,000 until a review by the Migration Advisory Committee was completed. \n",

    "Former newsreader Huw Edwards has pleaded guilty in court to three counts of making indecent images of children.\nThose offences are separate from newspaper allegations last year that he paid a young person for explicit photos.\nUntil the claims emerged, the broadcaster was one of the most recognisable faces on British television, anchoring major national events like the general election and the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. His career has now ended in disgrace.\nHere's a timeline of how the events unfolded:\nEdwards engages in a WhatsApp chat with a man called Alex Williams, who begins sending the BBC star explicit images.\nWilliams sends 377 pictures and video clips over the next 16 months, including 41 of children. They include seven category A images, the most serious classification - two of which show abuse involving a child aged between about seven and nine.\nOn 2 February 2021, Williams asks whether what he's sending is too young, to which Edwards responds telling him not to send any underage images, a court later heard.\nThe final indecent image of children is a category A film featuring a young boy sent in August 2021. Williams tells Edwards the boy is quite young looking, and he has more illegal images. Edwards tells him not to send any illegal images.\nThe Sun newspaper publishes a front-page story in which a mother claims an unnamed BBC presenter paid their child tens of thousands of pounds for explicit photos, which they used to fund a serious drug problem. She says this went on over three years, beginning in 2020 when their child was 17.\nThe parent had originally made a complaint to the BBC in May 2023, but it was only brought to the attention of senior managers - and Edwards himself - on 6 July.\nEdwards is not named in the Sun article, sparking several days of frenzied speculation about the presenter's identity.\nPrivately, BBC managers know he is the presenter involved, suspend him on full pay, and make contact with the Metropolitan Police.\nThese allegations are not related to Edwards' WhatsApp exchanges with Alex Williams, which are not public knowledge at this stage.\nThe lawyer representing the young person at the centre of the tabloid story disputes their mother's account, saying \"the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish\".\nEdwards' wife names him as the BBC presenter at the centre of the high-profile Sun allegations.\nShe says he's \"suffering from serious mental health issues\" and receiving in-patient hospital care.\nSimultaneously, the Metropolitan Police and South Wales Police say they have found no evidence of criminal offences in relation to the allegations at the heart of the Sun stories. The BBC says it will resume an internal investigation.\nJust before his name was revealed, there were more allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The Sun reported that the still unnamed presenter broke lockdown to meet a 23-year-old from a dating app, sent them cash, asked for a picture, and was sent a semi-naked photo.\nBBC News reported that someone in their early 20s says the presenter contacted them on a dating app and that they were later sent threatening messages. Also, three current and former BBC staff members claimed they were sent messages that made them uncomfortable.\nEdwards is arrested after a phone seized during an unrelated investigation reveals his participation in the WhatsApp exchanges with Williams.\nA small number of senior BBC figures are made aware that Edwards has been arrested on suspicion of serious offences.\nHe remains suspended and the arrest is not made public.\nThe internal \"fact finding disciplinary investigation\" that the BBC started after the Sun allegations concludes, and a \"confidential disciplinary process\" begins. It's not known whether this was before or after his arrest over the separate charges.\nThe BBC announces that it has apologised to the family of the young person involved in the Sun story, as part of a report commissioned in its aftermath.\nIt also apologises that the initial complaint was not \"escalated quickly enough\".\nAlex Williams, 25, who sent Edwards pictures of abuse on WhatsApp, receives a 12-month suspended sentence after pleading guilty to possessing and distributing indecent images of children as well as possessing prohibited images of children.\nEdwards resigns from the BBC on \"medical advice\", the corporation says.\nThe BBC confirms Edwards was not paid off as part of his departure, which comes before the internal disciplinary process against him has concluded.\nEdwards is charged with three counts of making indecent images of children in relation to the WhatsApp exchanges with Williams.\nThe charges are not made public at this stage.\nThe BBC's annual report reveals that Edwards received a salary of \u00a3475,000-\u00a3479,999 between April 2023 and April 2024 - an increase of \u00a340,000 on the previous year.\nThe director general says the rise was agreed before any allegations arose and is partly due to natural pay progression, and partly because of \"exten",

The paper notes the King has not yet addressed the nation directly about the violence - but says he released a written statement expressing his \"profound shock\" about the stabbings in Southport.\n\nThe future of England's universities is the lead story for the Guardian.

    "A 1,600-tonne steel and concrete bridge has been moved into place above a railway and new HS2 tracks in Birmingham.\nAston Church Road bridge, which is 84m (275ft) long and 21m (68ft) wide, was moved over the existing Birmingham to Derby railway line in Saltley overnight on Saturday, HS2 said.\nIt includes an upgraded section of road along with cycle pathways, a pedestrian walkway, LED lighting and new woodland planting.\nThe work took five hours and the operation of the railway beneath was handed back to Network Rail five hours earlier than expected, HS2 said.\nLifting engineering experts moved the bridge into place using two 128-wheeled, self-propelled modular transporters between 22:00 and 03:00 BST.\nOther structures around the bridge are set to be completed in the coming weeks, with the original Aston Church Road bridge being demolished over the next 14 months to create extra space for the HS2 line to pass through.\nThe high-speed rail network was designed to connect London to Birmingham with reduced journey times, but the planned northern leg was scrapped by the government in 2023 amid spiralling costs. The huge infrastructure project has also drawn criticism from some on environmental grounds.\nSteve Powell, head of delivery for HS2, said of the new bridge: \u201cThis is another great construction milestone for HS2 in the West Midlands, with our teams using the most innovative techniques to deliver feats of engineering safely and efficiently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a great example of how the new infrastructure we\u2019re building for HS2 also upgrades the local road network, providing big improvements for local communities.\u201d\nDan Binns, project manager at Saltley Balfour Beatty VINCI, which oversaw the project, said there was \"an enormous feeling of pride within the team\".\n\u201cThis was a complex operation, made even more challenging because the bridge needed to be driven over four existing network rail lines, requiring years of precise planning and preparation,\" he said.\n\u201cWe purposely chose to move the bridge on wheels, so it could be built offline first, then moved across in just five hours, greatly reducing the impact on rail passengers.\u201d\nIn nearby Solihull, residents have complained about noisy construction work at night as part of the wider HS2 project.\nTheir misgivings were shared at a recent meeting of the rail line's Implementation Advisory Group at Solihull Council.\nThe authority gave planning approval to HS2 Interchange Station in 2020 which will serve Solihull, Birmingham Airport and the NEC.\nTahir Ahmed, senior engagement and interface manager at Balfour Beatty Vinci said a \"common theme\" was around the traffic management, lorry movements, and noise.\n\u201cWe do take complaints seriously,\" he said. \n\"When they are reported, they are reported to the HS2 help desk.\n\u201cThey are logged and tracked.

    "Five years on from a fire that destroyed a retirement complex in Cheshire, former residents say they still have questions about what happened on that day.\nAbout 150 people were left homeless when a blaze tore through the Beechmere apartments in Crewe on 8 August 2019, destroying almost everything.\nAll were safely evacuated despite safety plans requiring residents, many of whom were elderly or vulnerable, to stay in their flats in the event of a fire.\nA year ago charges were brought against six companies in relation to fire safety, but all of them have since made an application to have these dismissed.\nClaire Bagnall said she still remembered getting a call in the afternoon to say her mother's home was on fire.\nLike others, she said she had not expected the flames to spread as quickly as they did.\n\"We don\u2019t feel like we got any real answers, I don\u2019t think we ever will to be honest,\" she said.\nMs Bagnall, whose mother is now 90, said despite the shock at the time, the local community pulled together.\n\"People were donating things, and the fire service and police and everything were so good and the neighbours helped get people out,\" she said.\nFormer Beechmere resident Diane Anderson, 79, remembered the \"absolute horror\" she felt after discovering there was a fire.\n\"It was so unbelievable, it was unimaginable,\" she said.\nShe said some residents were not immediately aware the complex had begun to go up in flames.\nEven when they did start to realise there was a genuine emergency, they still did not evacuate straight away because there was a \"stay put\" policy in place which meant they were told to remain in their flats while it was dealt with.\nMs Anderson said she remembered two men running past her patio door, who told her to get out immediately - in contravention of the policy.\n\"There would have been fatalities if that stay put policy had not been broken,\" she said.\nDespite that, she said there was no panic among the elderly occupants.\n\"I couldn\u2019t even smell smoke,\" she said. \"There was no noise -

    "The US will deploy additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, the Pentagon said.\nTensions remain high in the region over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and a key commander of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\nMissile defence forces were placed on a state of increased readiness to deploy, the Pentagon said, adding that its commitment to defend Israel was \"ironclad\".\nIran's leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed \"harsh punishment\" against Israel for the assassination of Haniyeh.\nThe Hamas leader was killed in Tehran on Wednesday. Iran and its proxy in Gaza blamed the attack on Israel, which has not commented.\nHaniyeh, 62, was widely considered Hamas's overall leader and played a key role in negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza war.\nHis death came just hours after Israel claimed it killed Fuad Shukr, the top military commander of Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah.\nA Pentagon statement said the new deployments would \"improve US force protection... increase support for the defence of Israel, and ... ensure the US is prepared to respond to various contingencies\".\nThe deployments would include additional ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers, it said.\nOn Tel Aviv\u2019s seafront, the mood appears relaxed with bronzed bodies lazing under beach umbrellas.\nBut few are in any doubt that the Middle East stands perilously close to full- scale war.\nIsrael is on high alert. \nSeveral international airlines have suspended flights to the country. \nMeanwhile, Israeli ministers were sent home this weekend with satellite phones in case of an attack on communication infrastructure.\nEarlier on Saturday, Israeli forces killed a Hamas operative in the West Bank.\nDozens of Palestinians were reported to have been killed in strikes on Gaza in the last 24 hours - a reminder that Israel\u2019s war in the region continues even as diplomats scramble to prevent its escalation.\nThe US military has stepped-up deployments before, on 13 April when Iran launched an attack on Israel with drones and missiles. Israel and its allies shot down almost all of roughly 300 drones and missiles that were fired.\nIsrael has not commented directly on the strike which killed Haniyeh. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered \"crushing blows\" to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of Shukr in Beirut.\nHe warned Israelis that \"challenging days lie ahead... we have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario\".\nEarlier, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the US did not believe escalation was inevitable.\n\"I think we are being very direct in our messaging that certainly we don't want to see heightened tensions and we do believe there is an off-ramp here and that is that ceasefire deal,\" Singh said.\nAn Israeli delegation will travel to Cairo in coming days for negotiations to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Mr Netanyahu said on Friday.\nHamas sparked the war with its 7 October attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people. Israel responded with an ongoing military operation in Gaza that has killed almost 40,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe circumstances surrounding Haniyeh's death are, as yet, still unclear.\nOn Saturday, the Daily Telegraph reported that Iranian agents hired by Israel's Mossad spy agency had planted bombs in a building where Haniyeh was staying.\nThe newspaper says that two agents placed bombs in three rooms of an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp guesthouse in Tehran, which were detonated from abroad.\nAn earlier report by the New York Times said that the bombs had been snuck into the building two months earlier. \nThe BBC has not been able to verify these claims.",

The paper says Yvette Cooper points out those who \"whip up\" hatred online will face the same \"reckoning\" as those involved in the clashes.\nIn the Guardian, the spokesman for senior police on public order, Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington, said a range of criminal offences were being investigated for those involved, saying social media is being used in the \"incitement and encouragement\" of violence. He says people in foreign countries are putting out disinformation, and that the former English Defence League leader Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, is \"one among many\". \nThe Daily Mail features a photo of Tommy Robinson on holiday in Cyprus.  \"Stoking race riots from his sunbed,\" reads the headline. The paper says he posted more than a hundred times on X over the course of the weekend, with millions of views.\nIn other news, the Daily Telegraph reports Royal Navy ships and RAF helicopters have been put on standby in the Middle East.

    "A map that would have seen land around Jurby Airfield zoned for its potential expansion has been withdrawn from an area plan after concerns from local homeowners.\nThe proposals by the Department of Infrastructure (DoI) came to light during an inquiry into the Draft Area Plan for the North and West, which outlines future development land.\nHowever, the department said it had put forward a revised submission without the expansion, and would engage with the community in the autumn as an Airport Masterplan is developed.\nJurby Commissioners said a public meeting to discuss the now withdrawn map would still take place on Monday evening.\nAn Airport Masterplan is currently being developed and would \"explore plans\" for improving the current facilities at Ronaldsway, as well as the current role of Jurby Airfield and \"what may be required in the future\" at the site, the DoI spokesman said.\nUnder the withdrawn proposals to zone land surrounding the former RAF site, an extra 2.5km (0.62 mile) of runway at the site was proposed on land that some housing has been built on.\nThe department spokesman said safeguarding of the airfield and the surrounding land had been in place since 2004, and while there were \"currently no plans\" to expand it, protecting the land ensured a \"long-term backup\".\nThe department would \"fully explain\" the need for the proposal, and what any expansion \"might mean for those living and working in and around Jurby\" in the autumn, he added.\nJurby Commissioners said despite the change to the DoI's submission, the meeting would allow for the local authority and residents to consider the \"potential future changes\", to \"enable considered discussion\" during the consultation.\nThe authority said both MHKs for the area - Chief Minister Alfred Cannan and Enterprise Minister Tim Johnston - had confirmed they would be attending the meeting at Jurby Parish Hall from 19:00 BST.\n\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0X?

    "The largest Scottish freshwater pearl found in living memory is being auctioned, nearly six decades after its discovery.\nThe Abernethy Pearl is expected to fetch between \u00a340,000 and \u00a360,000 when it goes under the hammer on 21 August.\nThe pearl was discovered in the River Tay by William (Bill) Abernethy, who was credited as Scotland\u2019s last dedicated pearl fisherman.\nHe found it in 1967, before the pearl fishing ban was introduced in Scotland in 1998.\nIt is believed the Abernethy Pearl, affectionately known as Little Willie, could have been growing in its mussel for more than 80 years before Mr Abernethy found it, meaning it was created during the reign of Queen Victoria.\nWeighing 43.6 grains, it is the largest freshwater pearl found in Scotland in modern history, although it is smaller than the Kellie Pearl which was discovered in the 1540s and is set in the Scottish Crown.\nMr Abernethy, who died in 2021 aged 96, never disclosed the exact location of the rare find.\nIt is thought only one in every 5,000 mussels found in Scottish rivers contains a pearl, and generally they are smaller than their saltwater counterparts.\n\nDuring the 1970s, award-winning wildlife cameraman Doug Allan worked with Mr Abernethy as a pearl diver.\nIn an obituary, Mr Allan noted his friend was able to discern from the size and shape of the mussel if it contained a pearl.\nThis enabled him to pick carefully and leave other mussels undisturbed.\nHe said: \u201cMr Abernethy was a unique man and it was a privilege to have known him.\n\u201cI recall watching Mr Abernethy fishing with his glass and stick and then he gave me a go. It didn\u2019t take long to appreciate just how much hard graft it was.\nIt is believed he wrapped the pearl in a dock leaf to keep it from scratching before he took it to Cairncross of Perth jewellers, where it remained.\nThe pearl will be auctioned at Lyon and Turnbull\u2019s Edinburgh auction house as part of the Cairncross Collection of pieces from the Perth jewellers, with bids also accepted online.\nRuth Davis, Lyon and Turnbull head of jewellery, said: \u201cThe Cairncross Collection offers a final opportunity to obtain a piece of Perthshire history.\n\u201cThe Abernethy Pearl is, of course, the star of the sale and we\u2019re excited to see the interest the auction will undoubtedly generate.\u201d",

We only ever saw one festival at a time, one year ahead,\" he said.\n\"We had no desire to grow it to the size we have now, it's just felt right.\"\nKendal Calling is now looking at its 20th edition next year.\n\"I have vertigo, it's crazy,\" Mr Smith said. \nKendal Calling's continued success comes at a time when some other festivals have been struggling. \nAccording to the Association for Independent Festivals (AIF), 50 UK festivals have announced a postponement, cancellation or complete closure so far in 2024.\nMr Smith said part of Kendal Calling's success was because it \"started at the right time, in the right location\", but also it managed to build a loyal audience.\n\"It's grown slowly and gradually over time,\" he said.\n\"What's happening at the moment, certainly since the pandemic, is that people just don't have the money they used to. \n\"Whereas previously they might go to three or four festivals a year, now they're just going to one. \n\"The reason perhaps they're choosing Kendal is because it's got a great reputation from slowly growing over the years, attracting such a loyal audience.\n\"They know that it sells out every year, so that creates its own kind of demand.\"\nThe AIF has warned that without intervention, more than 100 festivals in the country could disappear this year.\nMr Smith said the struggles faced by some festivals were not good news for the music industry.\n\"It's an incredibly tiring, and stressful job and risky job. Everyone's equally hard-working,\" he said.\n\"It is a difficulty at the moment and whilst Kendal might sell out, it's not great news for the music industry as a whole and if it's not good news for the music industry as a whole, it's not going to be good news for Kendal either.\n\"We all need a vibrant festival scene.

    "US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has revoked a pre-trial agreement reached with men accused of plotting the 11 September 2001 attacks.\nIn a memo on Friday, Mr Austin also said he was revoking the authority of the officer overseeing the military court who signed the agreement on Wednesday. \nThe original deal, which would reportedly have spared the alleged attackers the death penalty, was criticised by some families of victims. \nThe 9/11 attacks in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania were the deadliest assault on US soil since the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where 2,400 people were killed. They sparked the \"War on Terror\" and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.\nIn his memo, Mr Austin named five defendants including the alleged ringleader of the plot, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, all of whom are held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. The original deal named three men.\n\"I have determined that, in light of the significance of the decision to enter into pre-trial agreements with the accused... responsibility for such a decision should rest with me as the superior authority,\" Mr Austin wrote to Brig Gen Susan Escallier.\n\"I hereby withdraw your authority. Effective immediately, in the exercise of my authority, I hereby withdraw from the three pre-trial agreements.\"\nThe White House said on Wednesday that it had played no role in the plea deal.\nThe five men named in the memo were: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, often referred to as KSM, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak bin Attash, Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi; and two others not mentioned in the original plea: Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Ali Abdul Aziz Ali.\nThe men have been in custody for decades without trial. All have alleged they were tortured - KSM was subjected to simulated drowning, so-called \"waterboarding\", 183 times before it was banned by the US government.\nAll have already faced more than a decade of pre-trial hearings, complicated by the allegations and evidence of torture against them.\nSeveral family members of victims had criticised the terms of the deal struck on Wednesday as too lenient.\nBrett Eagleson, the president of 9/11 Justice, which represents survivors and relatives of victims, had told the BBC earlier this week that the families were \"deeply troubled by these plea deals\".\nSpeaking on Saturday, Terry Strada, who lost her husband Tom and chairs the 9/11 Families United group, told the BBC she was \"very pleased\" to see the Pentagon revoke the plea deal and put the death penalty back on the table.\nIf the men are found guilty after a trial, Mrs Strada said she would want to see the death penalty, \"not because I am ghoulish or a horrible person, it's because it fits the crime\".\n\"They've murdered nearly 3,000 Americans on American soil... lives were just permanently altered on that day,\" she added. \nA lawyer at Guantanamo representing Mohammed told The New York Times that he was shocked by the sudden u-turn.\n\u201cIf the secretary of defence issued such an order, I am respectfully and profoundly disappointed that after all of these years the government still has not learned the lessons of this case,\u201d said lawyer Gary Sowards.\n\u201cAnd the mischief that results from disregarding due process and fair play.\u201d\nThe men have been accused of a litany of charges, including attacking civilians, murder in violation of the laws of war, hijacking and terrorism.\nIn September, the Biden administration reportedly rejected the terms of a plea deal with five men held at the US Navy base in Cuba, including Mohammed.\nThe men had reportedly sought a guarantee from the president that they would not be kept in solitary confinement and would have access to trauma treatment.\nKSM is alleged to have brought the idea of hijacking and flying planes into buildings to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. He was captured in Pakistan in 2003 along with Hawsawi, a Saudi who was an alleged fundraiser. \nAli, a computer scientist and nephew of KSM, is accused of providing technical support to the 9/11 operation. \nBin al-Shibh, a Yemeni, allegedly co-ordinated the attacks and had planned to be a hijacker but could not secure a US visa.\nBin Attash, also a Yemeni, is accused of bombing the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000, which killed 17 sailors, and involvement in the 11 September attacks.\nSeveral Republicans applauded the defence secretary for revoking the deal.\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson said the \"Biden-Harris Administration is correct to reverse course\", which he said followed Republicans \"launching investigations into this terrible plea deal\".\n\"Now deliver long awaited justice for 9/11 families,\" he said. \nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said the decision \"exercised good command judgement\". \n\"The previous plea deal would have sent absolutely the wrong signal to terrorists throughout the world,\" he added.\nEarlier on Friday, Republican Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Mike Rogers demanded answers from Mr Austin on how the deal was struck.\n\u201cThis deal signals willingness to negotiate w",

    "Scientists have discovered a reservoir of liquid water on Mars -  deep in the rocky outer crust of the planet.\nThe findings come from a new analysis of data from Nasa\u2019s Mars Insight Lander, which touched down on the planet back in 2018.\nThe lander carried a seismometer, which recorded four years' of vibrations - Mars quakes - from deep inside the Red Planet. \nAnalysing those quakes - and exactly how the planet moves - revealed \"seismic signals\" of liquid water.\nWhile there is water frozen at the Martian poles and evidence of vapour in the atmosphere, this is the first time liquid water has been found on the planet. \nThe findings are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  \nInsight's scientific mission ended in December 2022, after the lander sat quietly listening to \"the pulse of Mars\" for four years.\nIn that time, the probe recorded more than 1,319 quakes. \nBy measuring how fast seismic waves travel, scientists have worked out what material they are most likely to be moving through. \n\"These are actually the same techniques we use to prospect for water on Earth, or to look for oil and gas,\" explained Prof Michael Manga, from the University of California, Berkeley, who was involved in the research. \nThe analysis revealed reservoirs of water at depths of about six to 12 miles (10 to 20km) in the Martian crust.\n\u201cUnderstanding the Martian water cycle is critical for understanding the evolution of the climate, surface and interior,\u201d said lead researcher\u00a0Dr Vashan Wright, from UC San Diego\u2019s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\nProf Manga added that water was \"the most important molecule in shaping the evolution of a planet\". This finding, he said, answers a big question of \"where did all the Martian water go?\".\nStudies of the surface of Mars - with its channels and ripples - show that, in ancient times, there were rivers and lakes on the planet.\nBut for three billion years, it has been a desert. \nSome of that water was lost to space when Mars lost its atmosphere. But, said Prof Manga, here on Earth, \"much of our water is underground and there's no reason for that not to be the case on Mars too\".\nThe Insight probe was only able to record directly from the crust beneath its feet, but the researchers expect that there will be similar reservoirs across the planet. If that is the case, they estimate that there is enough liquid water on Mars to form a layer across the surface that would be more than half a mile deep. \nHowever, they point out, the location of this Martian groundwater is not good news for billionaires with Mars colonisation plans who might want to tap into it. \n\"It's sequestered 10-20km deep in the crust,\" explained Prof Manga. \n\"Drilling a hole 10km deep on Mars - even for [Elon] Musk - would be difficult,\" he told BBC News. \nThe discovery could also point to another target for the ongoing search for evidence of life on Mars. \n\"Without liquid water, you don't have life,\" said Prof Manga. \"So if there are habitable environments on Mars, those may be now deep underground.\"",

It is estimated to be laden with as much as \u00a316bn in treasure.\nThe researchers said the latest haul is an \"unprecedented set of archaeological evidence\".\nAmong the new finds are an anchor, glass bottles and a bedpan, according to a statement from the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History.\nThe ship, whose ownership remains contested, was carrying one of the largest amounts of valuables ever to have been lost at sea including chests of emeralds and some 200 tons of gold coins.\nAt the time, the vessel had been transporting its precious cargo to the Spanish king to help pay for his war against the British. \nAlmost 600 crew members went down with it in the Caribbean Sea.\n\"Results of this exploration have revealed an unprecedented set of archaeological evidence, which has greatly expanded our knowledge,\" the institutions in charge of exploring the wreck said in a statement.\nAlhena Caicedo, the director of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History, said it included \"a series of new materials that we hadn't seen before\". \n\"Among other things, pieces of wood or parts of the ship's hull, at least remnants indicating that there was wood there, and traces of possible anchors,\" she said.\n\"Other types of items found include nails, bottles, jars and some different materials like glass and ceramics.\"\nThe Colombia President Gustavo Petro has made recovering the shipwreck a priority before his term in charge ends in 2026.\nBut there is an ongoing debate over who owns the treasure.\nSpain claims the San Jos\u00e9 is a \"ship of state\" as it belonged to the Spanish navy when it was sunk and its contents are protected under a UN convention Colombia is not party to. \nBut indigenous Qhara Qhara Bolivians claim the riches were stolen from them. \nAnd US-based salvage company Sea Search Armada has taken Colombia to the UN's Permanent Court of Arbitration, seeking \u00a37.8bn, over claims it first discovered the vessel more than 40 years ago.\n",

    "The anti-immigration protesters who caused trouble on the streets of Belfast included British loyalists and Irish nationalists in a cross-border alliance of extremism.\nThey were brought together by anonymous social media posts, and personal contacts in shadowy far-right circles.\nIt is difficult to pinpoint one group or individual behind the protest in Belfast city centre.\nThe flags, banners and emblems on display showed a link to loyalism, along with far-right extremists from Dublin.\nUnion flags and Irish tricolours were waved side-by-side before trouble broke out in Belfast on Saturday afternoon.\n\u201cDivided by politics, united by racism,\u201d observed one onlooker as the unlikely protest pact emerged.\nAlthough many of those protesting seemed bent on confrontation, there were some in the crowd of several hundred who were attempting to demonstrate without violence.\nIn terms of loyalist paramilitary factions, there are suggestions that some elements of the UDA (Ulster Defence Association) in south Belfast or east Antrim may have been involved.\nRetired PSNI officer Jon Burrows watched social media footage of the protesters.\nHe said: \u201cIt looks like there was a gather-up of people from across different communities. There may be some paramilitary involvement, we don\u2019t fully know.\n\u201cBut what we do know is that some people went out with destruction in their heart and in their mind.\n\u201cWhat is absolutely key is that we get swift justice, and I hope that the courts will bring very firm sentencing, to send a very clear message out that this will not be tolerated. And the best way to nip this in the bud is swift and firm justice.\u201d\nGiven the divided history of Northern Ireland, much attention has focused on the British and Irish flags being used together by the anti-immigration protesters.\nIn Dublin, violence erupted last month during a protest at a site which had been earmarked for asylum seekers in Coolock in the north of the city.\nAmong the large banners carried around Belfast city centre on Saturday was one which stated \u2018Coolock says no\u2019.\nWhen it first appeared, some protesters from Belfast shook hands with those behind it.\nThere are reports of people socialising as well as protesting together. The front page headline of the Belfast Telegraph on Monday was \u2018Irish far right thugs drank with UDA in a Belfast bar\u2019.\nOne of the chants shouted by some of those present was a song in support of the far-right campaigner in the UK, Tommy Robinson.\nThere is a long-standing connection between elements of extreme loyalism and far-right groups, including Combat 18.\nThe unrest in parts of England and Northern Ireland over the weekend has been linked, by some of those involved, to the deaths of three young girls in a knife attack in Southport a week ago.\nFalse claims spread online that the person responsible was a Muslim and an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\nAt the Belfast protest on Saturday, derogatory chants and insults about migrants and Islam were heard repeatedly.\nAs a mob attacked businesses in parts of the Botanic area, any shop owned by someone outside the UK or Ireland was seen as a target.\nPolice appeared taken aback by the number of protesters and struggled to keep control as they roamed through the city streets.\nThe authorities will be better prepared next time.\nHowever, damage has already been done.",
    "CrowdStrike is being sued by its shareholders after a faulty software update by the cybersecurity firm crashed more than eight million computers and caused chaos around the world.\nThe lawsuit accuses the company of making \"false and misleading\" statements about its software testing.\nIt also says the company's share price dropped 32% in the 12 days after the incident, causing a loss in market value of $25bn (\u00a314.5bn).\nCrowdStrike denies the allegations and says it will defend itself against the proposed class action lawsuit.\nMeanwhile, the firm has said computers affected by the massive global IT outage are effectively now back to normal.\nThe US-based company stated that as of 5pm local time on Monday, 29 July (00:00, Tuesday GMT), the outage had been fixed - ten days after the incident began.\nThe suit filed in the Austin, Texas federal court, alleges that CrowdStrike executives defrauded investors by making them believe the company's software updates were adequately tested.\nThe lawsuit is seeking an unspecified amount of compensation for investors who owned CrowdStrike shares between 29 November and 29 July.\nIt cites chief executive George Kurtz, who said in a conference call on 5 March that the firm's software was \"validated, tested and certified.\"\nCrowdStrike told BBC News that it disputes the claims. \n\u201cWe believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nMeanwhile, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, Ed Bastian, has said in an interview with business news channel CNBC that the disruption caused by the outage cost the airline $500m, including lost revenue and compensation to passengers.\nDelta has reportedly hired a prominent lawyer and is preparing to seek compensation from CrowdStrike.\nThe faulty update on 19 July crashed 8.5 million Microsoft Windows computers around the world. The outage disrupted businesses and services, including airlines, banks and hospitals. \nIn a detailed review of the incident, CrowdStrike said there was a \"bug\" in a system designed to ensure software updates worked properly.\nCrowdStrike said the glitch meant \"problematic content data\" in a file went undetected.\nThe company said it could prevent a repeat of the incident with better software testing and checks, including more scrutiny from developers.",
    "Campaigners have opposed plans to build part of a windfarm in their village, claiming it would \"devastate the environment\". \nThe Rampion 2 project team said the site chosen for its onshore electricity substation was in Bolney Road and Kent Street, in Cowfold, West Sussex.\nRampion told the BBC it has minimised the impact of the project, which is yet to get the go-ahead from the Planning Inspectorate.\nIt said the windfarm will generate enough renewable energy to power more than one million homes and reduce carbon emissions by 1.8 million tonnes per year.\n\"We are not against green energy,\" said Meera Smethurst from the campaign group Cowfold v Rampion.\nShe claimed locals had not been properly consulted about plans for the 12-acre facility near their village.\nShe said it would lead to increased traffic and congestion on nearby roads during its years-long construction.\nA Rampion spokesperson said they had gone through a \"comprehensive process of identifying issues, assessing impacts and proposing mitigations.\"\nThey said individuals and organisations have been provided the opportunity to express their views across a range of issues to the Planning Inspectorate, which will make its recommendation in 2025.\nRampion said a survey by Yonder consulting in 2022 found that 84% of locals think the advantages of the proposed windfarm outweigh any disadvantages.\nIt said 82% support the project \"principally\".\nBut campaigners said the project's impact - which will involve widening roads - was not limited to humans.\n\"The biggest issue is ecological destruction,\" said Ms Smethurst.\nShe claimed building the site and laying cables from the offshore windfarm would lead to the destruction of 100s of trees - including ancient oaks - and natural habitats for birds, mammals and reptiles.\nShe said: \"You cant solve the energy crisis by destroying wildlife. Nature is irreplaceable.\"\nIn a statement, Rampion said the Cowfold site had been selected because it was \"better overall from an engineering and environmental perspective\".\n\"All the cables would be buried underground so this would be a temporary impact during construction, as the project is committed to reinstate the land back to its former condition as soon as possible after the works,\" it added.\nRampion 2 is an expansion on the existing windfarm near Brighton which opened in 2018. \nIf approved, it would double its size of the with an extra 90 turbines connected by more than 20 miles of cabling from Clymping Beach to the new proposed substation in Cowfold.\nWest Sussex County Council told the BBC it was a consultee in the planning process, but had \"no control\" over whether consent should be granted. \nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \u201cOur mission is for clean power by 2030, because getting clean, homegrown energy is the way to bring greater energy independence.\n\u201cSecuring Britain's clean energy future requires improving outdated infrastructure to get renewable electricity on the grid and unleash its true potential.\n\u201cIt is also important we listen to people\u2019s concerns, and where communities live near clean energy infrastructure, they should benefit directly from it.\u201d\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Twelve-year-old Isla has always found maths difficult but as she started secondary school, she became aware of how it was affecting her.\n\"I found it a bit off. I knew there was something wrong but I didn't know what it was. I thought there was something wrong with me and it made me feel really different from everyone else,\" she said.\nFor her mum Faye, trying to help her at home she began to run out of ideas. \"No matter how much homework or support we gave at home, things weren't progressing and if anything we started to feel a bit behind. \n\"Counting on her fingers, telling time on a clock, estimating how long things might take, all those things have been quite tricky for Isla.\" \nIt was a tutor who helps Isla with her dyslexia who suggested she should get an assessment for dyscalculia. For Isla, putting a name to the condition has helped. \"Once I figured out I had dyscalculia it was the biggest relief ever.\"\nDyscalculia is described by the charity National Numeracy as a \"specific and persistent difficulty in understanding numbers which can lead to a diverse range of difficulties with mathematics\". \n\"The issue with dyscalculia is being able to relate the digits in our numerical system with the magnitude or value of a number - so they have no meaning. \n\"People with dyscalculia couldn't automatically answer the question: \"Would it be sensible to pay \u00a34,000 on a pair of shoes or \u00a348 on a small slice of cheddar? The relationship or mapping that number to its value does not develop naturally.\"\nIt's also something that affects people's working memory, for example remembering PIN numbers and getting locked out of accounts and withdrawing the wrong amount of money from cash machines. \nThe Dyscalculia Network say it affects around 6% of the population - around one million children and two and a half million adults. \nDespite that, less than 0.5% of people with dyscalculia are recognised in schools.\nThey are hoping, however, its recent inclusion in a storyline in EastEnders will help to raise awareness. \nIn an episode on 17 July, Louie Beale was diagnosed with the condition at school. \n\"It's like dyslexia but with numbers\" is how his mum's character Lauren Branning described it.\nExcept, says the Dyscalculia Network, it's not something as likely to happen in real life. \nCat Eadle from the organisation said: \"There's a serious lack of support for students in school with dyscalculia with no compulsory training for maths teachers. \n\"We would therefore very much like that all maths teachers received compulsory training in dyscalculia included as part of their teaching qualifications and training. \n\"This would enable them to identify indicators and support. \n\"Unfortunately, many adults think they are 'bad at maths', lack confidence and don\u2019t have GCSE maths or even foundational life skills maths that they need and this has a huge impact on their daily lives.\"\n\nIn response, the Department for Education said: \"We are clear that the education and care system does not currently meet the needs of all children, particularly those with SEND.\n\"Learning how to support children with SEND is already part of Initial Teacher Training, and from September all SEND co-ordinators (SENDCO) will be required to take a mandatory qualification so they establish a culture of inclusion in their schools, and identify the needs of SEND pupils early on.\"\nThe benefit of early intervention, say the Dyscalculia Network is, that younger people can be supported with interventions that break maths down into manageable chunks. That is what Isla and her mum are now doing.\nHer mum Faye says for Isla there was a sense of relief. \n\"We're learning the basics again, it was taken at a much slower pace, making the teaching more visual which supports her with how she processes number so bit by bit we found we're building the blocks and I found she's actually started enjoying maths. In her words, 'I'm starting to get it.'\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to hello.bbclondon@bbc.co.uk",

He said the economy is not an important issue,\" it said.\nTrump has been on the defensive in recent days, after the Democratic ticket got a boost of energy when Ms Harris replaced Mr Biden as the nominee. \nReports suggest the Trump campaign is trying to get their candidate back on message after several events in which the former real estate mogul has been less focused on policy.\nA new survey from the Cook Political Report suggests Ms Harris is erasing Trump's polling leads in multiple swing states. \nAccording to the publication, she polls ahead of the former president in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The pair are tied in Georgia.\nThe race remains very competitive ahead of the November election, however, and surveys also suggest that voters trust Trump on economic matters more than Ms Harris. \nMs Harris is due to travel to North Carolina on Friday to deliver a speech laying out her own economic proposals.\nOutside the Asheville venue where Trump spoke, supporters described to BBC News why they back the former president.\n\"I love the fact that he stands for his beliefs and he stands for his country,\" said Lisa Ramsey, an Asheville resident.\nZach Young, from nearby Hendersonville, said the Biden administration has overseen \"three and a half years of suffering\".\n\"We need to get back on the right page. The country needs to be run like a business,\" he said. \nThe economic speech comes after the United Autoworkers Union (UAW) filed Unfair Labor Practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board over comments made by Trump and Elon Musk.\nIn a conversation on X/Twitter on Monday, Trump praised Mr Musk for firing workers who went on strike.\nTrump said that if workers strike, \"you say \u2018that\u2019s OK, you're all gone. You're all gone.' So everyone is gone\".\nBut federal law says companies cannot fire striking employees. \nOn Wednesday, the union said it planned to mobilise its one million active and retired workers to vote for Ms Harris. \nThe move gives her campaign momentum in swing states such as Michigan, where UAW members accounted for 9.2% of the state's votes for Mr Biden in 2020, the union said. \n\"When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean. When we say Trump stands against everything our union stands for, this is what we mean,\" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement.\nPresident of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Sean O'Brien echoed those sentiments.\nMr O'Brien spoke at last month's Republican National Convention, calling Trump \"one tough SOB\".  \nBefore his comments with Mr Musk, the Republican candidate had expressed some labour-friendly remarks.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump cast his ballot in Florida's primary election. His vote was submitted during the early voting window. \nHe has previously been a critic of early voting, claiming without evidence that it makes elections vulnerable to fraud.",
    "The UK government has agreed to a two-year extension for a Troubles' victims payment scheme following appeals by both victims and campaigners.\nThe Troubles Permanent Disability Payment (TPDP) scheme is now open for applicants until August 2026.\nIt offers payments to those who suffered physical or psychological injuries in the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, an element of the scheme - a one-off, tax-free payment backdated to 2014 - was due to close for applicants at the end of August 2024.\nA sunset clause in legislation meant that to get the backdated lump sum, applications also had to be submitted by the end of this month.\nAfter that, successful applicants would only receive the monthly element of the payment scheme.\nFormer Northern Ireland secretary Lord Peter Hain wrote to the then secretary of state, Chris Heaton-Harris, asking him to consider extending the back payment deadline.\nIn his letter, Lord Hain highlighted reasons why the cut-off point should be extended, including backlogs caused by delays in obtaining medical records.\nHe also told Mr Heaton-Harris that there were people who were eligible to apply to the scheme who did not know of its existence.\nThe new Northern Ireland Secretary, Hilary Benn, has now agreed to extend the scheme until August 2026.\nExplaining his decision Mr Benn said: \u201cApproximately 40,000 people were injured during the Troubles, and it is essential that we recognise the great hurt that was caused during this dark period in our history.\"\nMr Benn said the Troubles Permanent Disablement Payment Scheme, which is overseen by the Victims Payments Board, has made \"progress in making acknowledgement payments to permanently injured victims of the Troubles\".\n\u201cBut with the deadline approaching, there was a risk that some potential applicants would miss out on backdated payments,\" he added.\n\"I have therefore decided to extend the period for which backdated payments are available by a further two years.\"\nHe hopes the deadline extension will assist both those who have suffered and are applying to the scheme, but those who are supporting applicants.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster, Paul Gallagher of the victims' support group the Wave Trauma Centre, said the decision to extend the scheme, \"while overdue, is totally welcome\". \n\"It was the common sense decision. We\u2019ve been saying it\u2019s a no brainer for so long, I think it would have been unfair to have this cut off point,\" Mr Gallagher said. \n\"We\u2019re thankful that it\u2019s through,\" he said. \nMr Gallagher said that even thinking about coming forward to apply for the scheme can be \"pretty onerous\" for some people. \n\"Even thinking about coming forward, for many people, can be a struggle, but when they do come forward, hopefully to our staff who are well trained, very empathetic, want to help people to get as full an application as possible so they can maybe have a successful result,\" he said. \nMr Gallagher said many people still don't know about the scheme. \n\"A lot of people don\u2019t even maybe even see themselves or consider themselves as victims, as suffering from what\u2019s happened to them,\" he said. \nKenny Donaldson, of the victims group SEFF (South East Fermanagh Foundation), welcomed the decision, which he said his group had \"lobbied hard\" for.\n\"This is hopefully a good omen from this secretary of state that he is prepared to listen and to adapt policy thinking in line with delivering better outcomes for victims/survivors,\" he said. \n\"A stiffer test is ahead for him in respect of legacy and of agreeing a set of proposals which will ensure all victims/survivors have pathways to justice, truth and accountability.\"\nThe scheme, also known as the victims' pension, was originally set up in law by the Westminster government in 2020 to provide pensions to people who suffered physically and/or psychologically during the Troubles.\nThe level of payment could range from about \u00a32,000 to \u00a310,000 per year, depending on the extent of the applicant's disability.\nThe scheme will be open in total for five years from the date it first launched on 31 August 2021.\nIt is being run by the Victims' Payment Board, which determines each application and administers the fund.\nHowever, some victims' groups have been critical of the decision-making process and the length of time it takes.\nIn January, BBC News NI reported that more than 40 people who applied to the scheme have died before any decision was made.\nAs of December 2023, a total of 6,209 applications had been received by the board.",
    "On a crisp September night in 1943, a woman boarded a warplane ready to return to Poland to fight the Nazis, a parachute strapped to her back and a blue dress beneath her flight suit.\nEl\u017cbieta Zawacka had arrived in the UK in May following a perilous journey lasting several months across 1,000 miles of occupied territory.\nBranded \"the captain in a skirt\" and \"a militant female dictator\" as she confronted those in charge in London, her efforts would transform the status of women in the Polish Home Army, helping to save thousands of lives.\nOn her return to her homeland, and having played a major role in the largest organised insurrection against Germany in World War Two, her \"reward\" was to be captured, tortured and jailed by her own government.\nSo who was the woman who went by the name of Zo, and what inspired her to acts of such defiance and bravery?\nEl\u017cbieta Zawacka was born in 1909 in the city of Toru\u0144, a part of Poland which had been under the control of Prussia, then later Germany, for nearly a century.\nAt the end of World War One, the area was reclaimed by Poland. When both Germany and the Soviet Union invaded the country in September 1939, Zawacka  joined the underground resistance, taking the code name Zo and building an intelligence network made up nearly entirely of women that covered the size of Wales.\nHer blonde hair and perfect German made her an ideal candidate to act as its main courier, smuggling microfilms packed with military information hidden in objects such as toothpaste tins, keys and cigarette lighters - often into Berlin where the illicit cargo would be handed to another agent to be passed on to the West.\n\"It's really ironic,\" says Clare Mulley, historian and author of a new book, Agent Zo. \"She has to bring information from Nazi German-occupied Poland right into the heart of the Third Reich as that's the fastest way they can get it to London.\"\nIn May 1942 her network was infiltrated by the Nazis and soon Gestapo officers were in hot pursuit. At one point, Mulley says, Zo leapt from the door of a moving train to evade an officer who had joined her in the carriage.\nWith her intelligence network compromised and her name and face known, she was handed a new mission.\nAssigned by the commander of Poland's Home Army, Gen Stefan Rowecki, as his personal representative, Zo was instructed to cross occupied Europe to pass orders to the country's government-in-exile, which was based in London.\nDeparting in February 1943, the journey first took her back to Berlin and then on to Paris, where she soon feared the worst when her fake identity papers were confiscated by a hotel clerk.\n\"She knows they think there's something up, but when they return them to her the next morning, they say, 'What wonderful papers, we kept them to compare against a possible forgery,'\" says Mulley.\nNeeding to reach Gibraltar to catch a troopship to Britain, Zo next hid herself inside a secretly adapted tender (water-tank carriage) on a train used by French politician and Nazi collaborator Pierre Laval.\nThis took her to the Pyrenees, almost drowning her in the process, from where she trekked across the mountain range into Spain.\nAgain Zo was nearly captured. At one point, Mulley says, she was thrown out of a hotel window by her guide to shake off two German officers who had picked up her resistance companions. She was later shot at as she crossed the frozen mountain passes.\nZo finally boarded a ship to Liverpool where she was immediately picked up by MI6 and taken to its south London base, amid fears she was an enemy agent.\nPapers held by the National Archives show this questioning was seemingly done in the most British way possible.\n\"One of the very first memos is from her interrogating officer and he just says rather pathetically: \u2018She was rather reluctant to pass information on to me.' \n\"I love that. It\u2019s very polite,\" laughs Mulley.\nZo soon moved into a hotel in Piccadilly and joined up with the Polish authorities, who were bemused by the arrival of someone who had gained legendary status - but was also a woman.\n\"They don't know whether to salute her or to bow and kiss her hand,\" Mulley says.\nFor Polish war hero Kazimierz Bilski, there was one thing for it. He declared that \"out of a bachelor's long-standing habit, I tried my best to draw her into some semblance of flirtation\". \n\"He takes her across St James's Park and it's spring and there's bluebells and birdsong and American GIs making out with the English girls, and he pulls from his pocket these silk stockings like an amorous magician and flirts with her,\" explains Mulley.\n\"Zo's absolutely appalled because the only women wearing silk stockings in Poland are the wives of Gestapo officers. She could be killed if she was caught with them. \n\"It just shows to her how little he understands what the situation is like behind enemy lines.\"\nAs a courier she had witnessed first hand the risks members of the resistance took when smuggling intelligence across Europe and, in her",
    "There was a drop in casualties on 20mph and 30mph roads in Wales in the first three months of 2024, after the default 20mph speed limit was introduced.\nThe number of serious casualties or fatalities has dropped 23%, with 78 people killed or seriously injured on both 20mph and 30mph roads, compared to 101 serious casualties in the first quarter of 2023, before the default 20mph.\nWhen minor injuries are included, the figures still show a 26% reduction for casualties of all severities.\nThe Welsh government called the figures \"encouraging\" and said every casualty reduced made a difference.\nSince September 2023, 37% of roads in Wales have had a default 20mph limit, with far fewer roads now having a 30mph limit.\nFor that reason it is seen as best to look at casualties for 20mph and 30mph combined to judge any effects of the change.\nThe figures show there were 377 casualties of all severities in January to March, compared to 510 in the first quarter of 2023.\nThat included five fatalities at 20 and 30mph, compared to 11 in the same period in 2023.\nThe number of road casualties is the lowest quarterly figure recorded in Wales outside the Covid pandemic period, although Welsh government statisticians are cautious, warning that figures can be volatile and only cover a short period so far.\nNevertheless, indications are that the 20mph limit, aimed at getting motorists to slow down in built-up and residential areas, could be having an effect.\nWhen we look at the six month period since last October - after the 20mph policy came in - there has been a 17% drop in serious road casualties, compared to the same six months in 2022-23.\nThe figures appear to underscore separate data from GoSafe, which found 97% of the thousands of vehicles monitored since January were keeping under the enforcement threshold of 26mph.\nThere has been controversy over the introduction of the default limit.\nThe Welsh government will be reviewing the limits on some main routes, after a backlash.\nThe Welsh government said the data on casualty figures were \"encouraging and show things are moving in the right direction\".  \nA spokesperson said: \u201cWe expect data to fluctuate over the next few years as drivers adjust to the new speed.  We\u2019ve still got a way to go but every casualty reduced makes a difference.\n\u201cThe principal objective of the policy has always been to reduce casualties and help people feel safer in their communities and today\u2019s data reinforces we\u2019re on the way to achieving this.\u201d\nConservative transport spokeswoman Natasha Asghar said they would scrap the policy, leaving 20mph zones outside schools and hospitals.\nShe said that 20mph had done nothing to improve congestion, and increases in congestion had probably contributed to the figures.",
    "For more than 24 hours on Wednesday there was speculation and rumours on social media of possible protests and disorder in Gloucester and Cheltenham.\nPolice officers were deployed, shops and businesses closed early, some pubs decided not to open and the producers of a theatre show cancelled it over safety fears.\nIn the end, there was nothing apart from the real world consequences of misinformation being spread widely online, with police saying the information it received was \"third-hand rumour\".\nSo how did the whispers of potential trouble spread?\nGloucester and Cheltenham were not even on the suspected map of 39 proposed targets by far-right demonstrators, which set out the addresses of immigration law firms, unlike Bristol.\nEvents like these are not new: false claims were spread online that the person allegedly responsible for the killing of three young girls in Southport last week was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.\nThis inaccurate information spread fast, and a riot in Southport was followed by days of tension and disorder across the country.\nBut this was the Facebook post on a Cheltenham Facebook group that seemingly started the rumour locally.\nThe original post was deleted - but by then it was shared around with multiple new posts spreading that riots were going to happen.\nFacebook users also warned others to keep their kids indoors and the Cheltenham Business Improvement District even emailed its members warning of possible protests.\nThere was no concrete information by that point, and subsequently there were no protests or any sign of them about to happen.\nJustin Hudson, who runs Butlers in Gloucester and is the vice chair of Gloucester Nightsafe, was one of the many businesses who shut as a result of the rumours.\nHe told the BBC it was a good decision to close, and he said it was \"better to be safe than sorry\".\n\"There was definitely a mischievous vibe in the air, I went for a walk around the city and gauge the mood,\" he said.\n\"Just going off the mood of the city, I was not prepared to open Butlers and call people in for potentially there to be issue.\n\"We shut, and so did other licensees, and we all decided it was for the best to let the conversation die down and move on.\"\nHe added: \"It was as still as a mill pond in the entire city, there were no people gathering on the cross. \n\"There was nobody boarding their windows up, we aired on the side of caution to make sure our customers, residents and staff were all safe.\"\nAdele Owen, director of Gloucestershire Action for Refugees and Asylum Seekers, said: \"Somebody actually said 'is it really not safe in the UK, do I need to find somewhere else safe?'. That's so sad, isn't it? \n\"But they've had to flee before, we don't want them to feel like they have to do it again. We've reassured them, we know they will be safe.\"\nIn Bristol, thousands gathered to counter a rumoured further rally on Wednesday after online rumours spread. But far-right groups did not appear.\nDr Olivia Brown, associate professor of Digital Futures at the University of Bath, told the BBC about how misinformation was able to spread on Wednesday.\nShe said: \"People have referred to misinformation like a viral disease in the way that it has that contagion element to it. \n\"A prime example of that is the false name of the Southport attacker. We've seen that around certain concerns of the protests on Wednesday. \n\"Maybe concerns were heightening over the course of the day because it was being shared around with other people - that can cement that fear.\n\"People in general have been quite concerned and cautious. Understandably given the violence we saw at the weekend. \n\"That together could explain why we saw that messaging so pervasively, particularly some of the events in the South West.\"\nDr Brown outlined what questions people can ask when they read or hear information online.\nShe said: \"We can all take some steps to consider the source of the information. Where has it come from, the content of the information? Do we really believe this to be accurate?\n\"Do we really need to share that information? Do we need to spread that across a platform if we're not sure of the accuracy?\"\nGloucestershire Police's assistant chief constable Donna Lawton said people should \"look to trusted voices\" if in doubt.\nShe said: \u201cWe monitored the situation and had resources in place to respond to any incidents if required, however there were no gatherings nor disorder last night.\n\u201cWork from our team established that some of the information was third-hand rumour rather than any factual basis.\n\"We know lots of disinformation has been spread on social media across the country, and we would urge people to think twice about what you read and share online.\n\u201cThere are a lot of motivations for why people may be sharing information online, so be critical and question the veracity of the source.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Police Scotland are to send 120 officers to Belfast over the next week to help quell threats of violence.\nThe force said it had received a mutual aid request from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) ahead of expected anti-immigration demonstrations and counter protests on Friday.\nA security operation is being put in place across Northern Ireland after 10 officers were injured and 26 people were arrested over six nights of rioting and disorder.\nIt comes after First Minister John Swinney wrote to social media companies Meta, TikTok and X calling for \"immediate\" action to tackle misinformation and hateful material which has fuelled violent scenes across parts of the UK.\nPolice Scotland said the officers would be loaned as part of the arrangement.\nThe PSNI\u2019s assistant chief constable, Melanie Jones, said it would give the force \u201cvital additional resilience\u201d to deal with disorder.\nPolice in Belfast responded to several race-related hate crime incidents and other disorder on Thursday night, during which masked men targeted them with bricks and masonry, while cars were set on fire and homes were damaged.\nMrs Jones said 15 people had been charged with offences in relation to the disorder, describing the scenes as \u201ca disgrace\u201d.\nPolice Scotland have maintained that there is \u201cno intelligence\u201d of similar scenes \u2013 which were sparked by incorrect claims an asylum seeker was responsible for killing three young girls in Southport, Merseyside \u2013 being repeated in Scotland.\nA spokesperson said the force was able to assist its colleagues in Belfast without compromising on public safety in Scotland.\nThey said: \"Mutual aid requests are always balanced against the needs of policing in Scotland.\n\"As a national service, Police Scotland has the ability to flex resources where the need is greatest in order to keep people safe.\"\nOn Friday evening, about 150 people joined a Stand Up to Racism demonstration in Paisley and about 100 people gathered at a similar event in Bathgate, West Lothian.\nThe events were organised in response to rumours on social media that anti-immigration protests were being planned in the towns.\nHowever, there was no sign of far right protests.\nMeanwhile, Mr Swinney said Police Scotland had specifically raised concerns with him about the time taken to remove problematic posts from social media.\nHe said some of the posts may have met the threshold for charges under Scotland's hate crime laws that came into effect in April this year.\nThe first minister praised the force for acting quickly to correct misinformation that three people in Stirling had been stabbed by an Asian man on Saturday.\nThat claim was perpetuated on social media by English Defence League founder Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson.\nPolice later confirmed one 21-year-old woman had been taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries and a 29-year-old white man from the area, Callum Fisher, appeared in court on Monday charged with attempted murder.\n\nMr Swinney said there was \u201csignificant anxiety\u201d within Scotland\u2019s Muslim and Jewish communities over potential violence after meeting with faith leaders this week.\nHe said \u201cadequate preparations\u201d were in place to deal with any flare-ups should they happen and Police Scotland had the resources to deal with any potential disorder, regardless of the officers travelling to help colleagues across the Irish Sea.\nHe urged social media companies to outline the action they were taking to resist the spread of misinformation and to address racist and hateful speech across the platforms.\n\u201cI think social media companies are completely passive about this kind of issue,\" he said. \"They have an obligation to operate within the legal framework of this country and they are regulated by the various regulatory approaches that are in place.\n\u201cThey are allowing content to be circulated which incites hatred, which platforms violence and that\u2019s unacceptable in our society today.\"",
    "The BBC director general has defended the decision not to sack Huw Edwards, despite knowing that the presenter had been arrested in November over the most serious category of indecent images of children.\nIn an interview with BBC News on Thursday, Tim Davie said the corporation had taken \"difficult decisions in a fair and judicious manner\".\nAsked about how much BBC managers were told in November,  he said: \"We knew it was serious, we knew no specifics, apart from the category of the potential offences.\"\nMeanwhile, the Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy raised a number of concerns with the BBC over its handling of their internal investigation, including the use of licence fee payers' money, a spokesperson for her department said. \nEdwards, formerly the BBC's most high-profile newsreader, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to three counts of making indecent images of children.\nAlthough the BBC knew of the severity of the alleged offences, Mr Davie said the police had not told the corporation the details.\nBBC bosses were not aware of the ages of the children in the images.\nWhen the charges ultimately came to light earlier this week, Mr Davie said: \"We were very shocked. No-one knew about the specifics of what we heard over the last few days, which have been deeply disturbing.\"\nAsked by the BBC's David Sillito why Edwards could not have been sacked at the time of his arrest, Mr Davie replied: \"Because the police came to us and said they need to do their work in total confidence, [and said], 'please keep this confidential'.\"\nEdwards had not been charged at that point and it was still possible he would be cleared, Mr Davie noted.\n\"We thought long and hard about this. This wasn\u2019t a kneejerk decision. When you think about this in terms of precedent, people do get arrested, and then we've had situations where [there are] no charges, and there's nothing there to be followed up on.\"\nHe said the corporation also had to consider its duty of care to Edwards.\n\"When it comes to the decision we made in November, we were obviously faced with a difficult decision, and we considered it very carefully,\" Mr Davie said.\n\"The police... wanted to be assured of total confidence, and the reason they rung us at that point, it's a technical process to ensure employees are protected and there's no risk.\"\nHe added: \"Another factor at this point was very significant duty of care considerations. I think it was right for us to say we'd let the police do their business, and then when charges happen, we will act.\"\nEdwards received a \u00a340,000 pay rise in the last financial year, despite being off air for most of it.\nThe director general said the pay rise dated from before any allegations.\n\"There was a [small] inflationary increase, which was standard stuff, but in terms of the big pay rise you saw in the annual report, that related to his work at the BBC, extending the scope of his work at the BBC, and that relates to February [2023], way before any allegations.\"\nAsked whether Edwards would still receive his pension, Mr Davie said it was \"very difficult to claw back, nigh on impossible\", adding: \"These are unfortunately the specifics of how it works.\n\"When it comes to pay, again, [it's] legally challenging [to recover], but we\u2019ll look at all options.\"\n\nMr Davie was also challenged on the BBC's own investigation into Edwards, which has not been published.\nThe director general said the BBC was \"not sitting on anything that I think we need to share with the police, or is of a serious nature that would make me feel that we hadn\u2019t followed up properly\".\nHe continued: \"I can categorically say that when it comes to the offences we\u2019ve seen, which are truly horrendous, any evidence that is out there is not in the hands of the BBC. If I saw evidence of that, that is not a complicated decision [to hand it over].\"\nThe Metropolitan Police confirmed that it told the BBC in \"strict confidence\" about the arrest of Edwards on 8 November.\n\"Common law police disclosure (CLPD) is the established legal mechanism through which the police can inform an individual's employer when they are arrested or alleged to have committed an offence,\" a Met spokesman said.\n\"It is often used where the individual holds a position of trust/responsibility with the public.\n\"The information is provided in strict confidence in order to enable the individual's employer to consider what risk mitigation measures might be necessary.\"\nOn Thursday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"shocked and appalled\" by the charges against Edwards. \nLater, a spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media & Sport said Culture Secretary Ms Nandy was shocked by Edwards\u2019 \"abhorrent actions\". \nThe statement continued: \"The Secretary of State has spoken to the BBC to raise concerns on a number of points regarding the handling of their own investigations into Huw Edwards, what safeguards and processes had been followed in this case, and additionally, what further action may be taken, especially with regard to the",

    "Reports of antisemitic incidents in the UK in the first half of this year have reached another record high, according to figures from a Jewish security charity.\nFrom January to June 2024, the Community Security Trust (CST) recorded reports of 1,978 anti-Jewish hate incidents, up from 964 in the first half of 2023.\nThe CST says the record high total in the first half of 2024 is a continuation of the impact of antisemitic reactions to the 7 October attack in Israel and the ongoing war.\nThe report relies on figures from incidents that are self-reported.\nSome 1,037 of the recorded antisemitic incidents were in Greater London, including 411 in Barnet - the local authority home to the biggest Jewish community in the UK. \nThe CST said a technical problem in March onwards disrupted the flow of reports received from the Metropolitan Police, meaning the actual figure for Greater London would be even higher. \nThe region with the second highest number of recorded antisemitic incidents was Greater Manchester with 268, followed by West Yorkshire with 115. \nAcross the UK, the CST recorded 121 incidents of assault in the first six months of the year, an increase of 41% in the same period last year.\nCases of damage and desecration to Jewish property rose by 246% from 24 in the first half of 2023 to 83 between January and June 2024.\nThere were 142 incidents of threats in the six months from January to June. This is a rise of 158% from 55 in the same period a year ago.\nThere were 162 cases of antisemitism affecting people and property in education.  This is an increase of 119% from the 74 such incidents reported from January to June 2023.\nThe starkest figure is the rise in anti-Jewish hate involving higher education showing a 465% rise.\nIn the first six months of the year there were 96 antisemitic incidents in which victims were or offenders were students or academics, or which involved student unions or societies.\nThe CST says it is a record half-year spike as there were 17 instances of university-related antisemitism in the first six months of 2023.\nMark Gardner, chief executive of the CST, says the figures are unprecedented.\n\u201cThe CST will continue its steadfast protection of our British Jewish communities, driven by our values of Community, Security and Trust,\" he added. \n\"CST applauds our community\u2019s ever-increasing determination to stand strong and proud, despite the hatred.\u201d\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper described the figures as \"truly appalling\".\nShe added: \"There is no place in Britain for this vile hatred and we are absolutely clear that those who push this poison - on the streets or online - must always face the full force of the law.\"\nConservative shadow home secretary James Cleverly said: \"We must root out antisemitism wherever it occurs. \n\"It is up to all of us to stop and reverse the increase in this vile hatred we have seen in the UK since the Hamas terror attack on 7 October.\n\"It can never be right British Jews could be concerned for their safety on the streets of modern Britain.\"\nIn November, then Chancellor Jeremy Hunt promised \u00a37m over the next three years to charities tackling antisemitism in the UK.",
    "Serial killer Levi Bellfield has been blocked from having a civil partnership under a new law that stops the most serious offenders getting married in prison. \nBellfield is serving two whole-life sentences for the murders of Milly Dowler, Marsha McDonnell and Am\u00e9lie Delagrange, as well as the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy.\nHe had previously applied to marry his girlfriend and made a bid for legal aid to challenge a decision to block the marriage in 2022.\nBellfield recently submitted an application for a civil partnership, which is believed to have prompted the government to authorise the restriction from Friday.\n\nThe new law, which is part of the Victims and Prisoners Act, aims to \"deny the most heinous criminals from enjoying the important life events they callously took from their victims\", the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said.\nIt applies to killers who are serving whole-life orders, which includes Wayne Couzens and Lucy Letby.\nIn 2008, Bellfield was found guilty of the murders of 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell and 22-year-old Am\u00e9lie Delagrange, and the attempted murder of 18-year-old Kate Sheedy, and sentenced to life imprisonment.\nHe was already serving his sentence when he went on trial for the murder of Milly Dowler, 13, who was kidnapped from the street while walking home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002.\nHe was found guilty of abducting and killing her following a trial at the Old Bailey in 2011. \nIn 2022, The Sun reported Bellfield was engaged to a woman who had begun writing to him before becoming a regular visitor.\nThe paper also reported that he had won a bid to be granted up to \u00a330,000 in legal aid after his lawyers cited the European Convention on Human Rights and the 1983 Marriage Act.\nIt is understood he withdrew his marriage application in recent months and submitted a new one for a civil partnership.\nLord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"Victims should not be tormented by seeing those who commit the most depraved crimes enjoy the moments in life that were stolen from their loved ones.\n\"That is why I have acted as soon as possible to stop these marriages and give victims the support they deserve.\"\nThe Lord Chancellor will retain the right to permit ceremonies in the most exceptional circumstances, the MoJ said.\nPrior to the new law, prisoners could make a formal application for marriage or a civil partnership and could only be refused by a prison governor on the grounds of security concerns.\nPrevious notorious prisoners, including violent offender Charles Bronson, have been granted permission to marry while behind bars. \nBronson married former soap actress Paula Williams in 2017.",
    "Two police officers were injured and six people were arrested after \"violence and disorder\" broke out in Liverpool during two rival protests, police have said.\nMerseyside Police said two groups of about 750 protesters, who had been taking part in different protests in the city, met at the Pier Head at about 14:00 BST.\nThe force said the groups began to move on to The Strand and Church Street, where bricks and bottles were thrown at officers, a kiosk and phone shop were damaged and looted and an officer was pushed off his motorbike and assaulted.\nAssistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said six people aged between 29 and 58 were held on suspicion of violent disorder and criminal damage.\nThe violence broke out after a group who had been taking part in an anti-racism rally outside St George\u2019s Hall faced an anti-immigration demonstration at the Pier Head.\nBoth protests had been noisy, but relatively peaceful earlier in the day and police had created a buffer zone between the two groups.\nHowever, after a section of those demonstrating at the Pier Head moved on to the Strand, scuffles broke out and police made repeated charges into the crowd.\nOfficers in riot gear then gradually pushed protesters back towards the Albert Dock, as some of those in the crowd shouted abuse and claimed they were being victimised for \"trying to protect our kids\".\nMerseyside Police, which had introduced a Section 60 Order to increase its stop and search powers in the area, then brought in a Section 34 Order, which grants officers the power to disperse those engaged in antisocial behaviour, \"to help combat potential crime\".\nACC Sims said one officer had suffered a broken nose, while another had been left with a broken jaw.\nShe said the protesters' behaviour was \"completely unacceptable\".\n\"What should have been a sunny Saturday on the historic waterfront to be enjoyed by people of all ages turned into an afternoon of unashamed disorder and violence,\" she said.\n\"We have heard reports of families having to run away from the area, some of whom had brought children to see the Disney Princess cruise ship docked nearby.\"\nShe added that her officers had \"put themselves in harm\u2019s way in order to protect the wider community\" and she was \"incredibly proud of the bravery, resilience and professionalism they have displayed\".\nMerseyside Police and Crime Commissioner Emily Spurrell said she was \"appalled\" by the violent scenes.\nShe said what had happened was \"not protest\".\n\"It is mindless crime and disorder,\" she said.\n\"Those involved should expect to feel the full force of the law.\"\nIn a post on X, Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said what happened was \"mindless thuggery by people looking for an excuse to spew hatred and carry out acts of violence\".\n\"These scenes shame our city and those responsible deserve to feel the full weight of the law,\" he said.\nLiverpool was one of a number of towns and cities across England which saw unrest.\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said she would work with police forces to help ensure \"consequences, arrests and prosecutions\" for those responsible and warned that anyone engaging in \"unacceptable disorder\" would pay the price.\nThe protests came in the wake of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class being fatally stabbed in Southport on Monday.\nViolence erupted the following evening in the Merseyside seaside town, with police blaming far-right groups.\nFalse claims have spread online that the person responsible was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat and a Muslim.\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, from Banks in Lancashire, has been charged with three counts of murder, 10 attempted murders and possession of a curved kitchen knife.\nThe 17-year-old, who was born to Rwandan parents in Cardiff and moved to the Southport area in 2013, has no known links to Islam.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A brand-new Lion King attraction is coming to Disney's resort in Paris, the entertainment giant has announced.\nVisitors will go \"on a journey through the African savanna\" alongside iconic characters from Mufasa and Simba to Timon and Pumbaa, theme park chief Josh D\u2019Amaro said on Saturday.\nMock-ups of the experience, presented to Disney fans at the D23 convention on Saturday, showed a log flume plummeting down Pride Rock as Rafiki the monkey watches on.\nThe news comes just three days after Disney reported weaker-than-expected theme park results for the quarter that ended in June. \nA Lion King experience has been rumoured for the Disneyland Paris resort in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e since 2022. \nDisney announced last year that it planned to spend $60bn (\u00a347bn) over the next decade to expand its theme park and cruise businesses, double the amount spent over the previous decade, prompting excitement from fans.\nBosses have now confirmed that the Lion King-themed land will follow World of Frozen, a themed area based on the Frozen franchise that is due to launch in 2026 in Paris.\nThe new areas are in the Walt Disney Studios Park, which will be renamed Disney Adventure World to signal its new offering.\nFor the Lion King attraction, Disney's creative department - dubbed \"Imagineering\" - has promised to \"bring to life the majestic Pride Rock\".\nIt will serve as \"the gateway to an adventure-filled water attraction that will plunge guests beneath the rock to follow Simba on his journey from cub to king\", the company said.\nMeanwhile, at Walt Disney World in Florida, the flagship Magic Kingdom park will undergo the largest expansion in its 53-year history, with one new land devoted to classic Disney villains and another area focused on Pixar's Cars movies. \nAt Disney's Hollywood Studios park, a long-rumoured Monsters Inc rollercoaster themed around the 2001 film's famous \"flying door\" scene was confirmed.\nAnd at Disney's Animal Kingdom park, more details for Encanto and Indiana Jones-themed rides were announced.\nOn the US West Coast, the original Disneyland Resort in California will add two superhero-themed rides, a water-based Avatar attraction and the company\u2019s first Coco ride.\nAt Hong Kong Disneyland, a new Spiderman attraction will be opened as part of an immersive Marvel-themed area.\nDisney also announced four new cruise ships - on top of four others it had previously announced - almost trebling the size of its current fleet by 2031.\n\"Everything that we\u2019re going to share with you tonight is in active development,\" Mr D'Amaro said on Saturday. \n\"This means that plans are drawn. This means that dirt is moving. I just want to be clear with all the fans out there. This isn\u2019t blue sky.\"\nThe weekend's flurry of announcements come after a rollercoaster ride behind the scenes at Disney in recent years.\nChief executive Bob Iger dramatically returned to lead the company less than a year after retiring following a series of perceived missteps by his successor.\nSoon after his return Mr Iger announced a reorganisation and thousands of job cuts in a bid to improve the company's profits.\nEarlier this year, Disney won a boardroom battle against critics who accused the media giant of \"losing its creative spark\".\nActivist investors, including Nelson Peltz of Trian Management, had sought seats on the company's board of directors, which they said was too close to Disney's leadership.\n\"All we want is for Disney to get back to making great content and delighting consumers and for Disney to create sustainable long-term value for shareholders,\" Mr Peltz said at a shareholder meeting.\nJust 31% of votes cast supported Mr Peltz for a seat, according to a source familiar with the results.\nBut the battle raised questions about struggles at Disney. \nLast year, the company announced it was scrapping plans to build a new office campus in central Florida following a year-long dispute with Governor Ron DeSantis.\nMr DeSantis attacked the company after it opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early years.\nDisney filed a First Amendment lawsuit against Mr DeSantis and other officials.\nThe company had planned to build the campus around 20 miles (30km) from the giant Walt Disney World theme park resort and relocate 2,000 employees from Southern California.\nMr D'Amaro said in a memo to employees that \"new leadership and changing business conditions\" prompted the company to abandon those plans.\nThis year, the runaway success of Disney's Inside Out 2 has helped boost the entertainment giant's profits.\nBut operating profit declined 3% to $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) with the company blaming a \"moderation of consumer demand\" that \"exceeded previous expectations\", along with higher operating costs. \nThe 2024 Olympic Games in Paris were partly blamed for the drop in its theme park takings, which make up over half Disney's profit. \nHowever, its parks - among the most visited attractions in the world - have remained a reliable profit e",
    "Heavy rains and floods have affected several parts of India in recent weeks, killing scores of people and displacing thousands of others.\nFloods are not uncommon in the country - or South Asia - at this time of the year, when the region receives most of its rainfall.\nBut climate change has made monsoon rains more erratic, with massive rainfall in a short span of time followed by prolonged periods of dryness.\nNow scientists say that a type of storm, known as an atmospheric river, is making things worse with a significant increase in moisture because of global warming.\nAlso known as \"flying rivers\", these storms are huge, invisible ribbons of water vapour that are born in warm oceans as seawater evaporates.\nThe water vapour forms a band or a column in the lower part of the atmosphere which moves from the tropics to the cooler latitudes and comes down as rain or snow, devastating enough to cause floods or deadly avalanches.\nThese \"rivers in the sky\" carry some 90% of the total water vapour that moves across the Earth\u2019s mid-latitudes and, on an average, have about twice the regular flow of the Amazon, the world's largest river by the discharge volume of water.\nAs the earth warms up faster, scientists say these atmospheric rivers have become longer, wider and more intense, putting hundreds of millions of people worldwide at risk from flooding.\nIn India, meteorologists say the warming of the Indian Ocean has created \"flying rivers\" that are influencing monsoon rains between June and September.\nA study published in the scientific journal Nature in 2023 showed a total of 574 atmospheric rivers occurred in the monsoon season in India between 1951 and 2020, with the frequency of such extreme weather events increasing over time.\n\"In the last two decades, nearly 80% of the most severe atmospheric rivers caused floods in India,\" it said.\nA team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and the University of California, who were involved in the study, also found that seven of India's 10 most severe floods in the monsoon seasons between 1985 and 2020 were associated with atmospheric rivers.\nThe study said evaporation from the Indian Ocean had significantly increased in recent decades and the frequency of atmospheric rivers and floods caused by them has increased recently as the climate has warmed.\n\"There is an increase in the variability [more fluctuations] in the moisture transported towards the Indian subcontinent during the monsoon season,\" Dr Roxy Matthew Koll, an atmospheric scientist with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, told the BBC.\n\"As a result, there are short spells when all that moisture from the warm seas is dumped by the atmospheric rivers in a few hours to a few days. This has led to increased landslides and flash floods across the country.\"\nAn average atmospheric river is about 2,000km (1,242 miles) long, 500km wide and nearly 3km deep - although they are now getting wider and longer, with some more than 5,000km long.\nAnd yet, they are invisible to the human eye.\n\"They can be seen with infrared and microwave frequencies,\" says Brian Kahn, an atmospheric researcher with Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\"That is why satellite observations can be so useful for observing water vapour and atmospheric rivers around the world,\" Mr Kahn added.\nThere are other weather systems like westerly disturbances, monsoon and cyclones that can cause floods as well.\nBut global studies have shown that atmospheric water vapour has increased by up to 20% since the 1960s.\nScientists have associated atmospheric rivers with up to 56% of extreme precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) in South Asia, although there are limited studies on the region.\nIn neighbouring Southeast Asia, there have been more detailed studies on the links between atmospheric rivers and monsoon-related heavy rains.\nA 2021 study, published by the American Geophysical Union, found that up to 80% of heavy rainfall events in eastern China, Korea and western Japan during early monsoon season (March and April) are associated with atmospheric rivers.\n\"In East Asia there has been a significant increase in frequency of atmospheric rivers since 1940,\" says Sara M Vallejo-Bernal, a researcher with Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.\n\"We found that they have become more intense over Madagascar, Australia and Japan ever since.\"\nMeteorologists in other regions have been able to link a few recent major floods to atmospheric rivers.\nIn April 2023, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait and Jordan were all hit by catastrophic flooding after intense thunder, hailstorms and exceptional rainfall. Meteorologists later found that the skies across the region were carrying a record amount of moisture, surpassing a similar event in 2005.\nTwo months later, Chile was hit by 500mm of rain in just three days - the sky dumped so much water that it also melted snow on some parts of the Andes mountain, unleashing massive floods that destroyed roads, bridges, and water su",

    "Blue-green algae is back at 2023 levels in Lough Neagh.\nLarge green mats have formed around the lough, particularly in the north-east.\nA \"very sharp uptick\" in the amount of potentially toxic algae has been noticed in recent days by scientists monitoring the lough.\nBlue-green algae has already been detected in the Bann River system and scientists have said it could travel further up the north coast, where it closed bathing waters in Portstewart and Portrush last year.\nCauseway Coast and Glens Council confirmed this week that blue-green algae had been most recently detected at Cloonavin in Coleraine. \nWhile the algae may well make it to the coast, it cannot survive in salt water, but bathing bans or advisories may be used as a precaution until it has confirmed to have broken down. \nThe council has advised that people should not enter the water as a precautionary measure near Cloonavin and also advised pet owners to ensure their animals do not have access to this water. \nThe algae are in fact bacteria, which can cause skin irritation and sickness in people who come into contact with it, but the biggest risk is to pets, livestock and wildlife.\nDr Matthew Service, from the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI), said blue-green algae spreads rapidly. \n\"It starts to double every seven to 14 days,\" he said.\n\"So once you get to where you can see it, it's just going to keep going until either the climatic conditions change, there's not enough light for it to reproduce or it just simply breaks up with the autumn and winter weather,\" Dr Service said.\nAFBI scientists have detected the algae out in the middle of Lough Neagh, showing the wind is moving the very buoyant species around and causing it to clump together - or \"aggregate\".\nFrom the shoreline at Antrim, the water is visibly green.\nRegular walkers Karen and Allistair Gordon said they were \"shocked\" by the sight and the smell of the lough and the Sixmilewater river flowing into it.\n\"I just don't understand how it's got to this stage,\" said Mr Gordon, who is an amateur wildlife photographer.\n\"It's just heartbreaking to see.\"\nMs Gordon described it as \"a very sad day\".\nWhen BBC News NI visited Antrim Lough Shore Park on Thursday, a number of people voiced their displeasure at the blue-green algae levels.\nTeresa Greer, who is part of a walking group, said the algae on Lough Neagh was \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\"The smell is disgusting,\" she added.\nMs Greer said some members of the walking group had to stop their stroll, as the \"smell was so foul at Rea's Wood\".\nRea's Wood is a nature reserve located at the north-east corner of Lough Neagh.\nLast month, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) advised people against bathing at Rea's Wood due to \"the presence of a thick algal scum\".\nOne of Ms Greer's walking companions, Anne Gregg, also expressed her concern about the algae.\n\"Dog walkers don't come up to Rea's Wood, near the water,\" she added.\n\"My son and brother won't walk their dogs there just in case.\n\"There is no quick fix,\" she added.\nJohn and Gwen Dowling said they regularly make trips to Antrim Lough Shore Park, from their home in Lisburn.\nMr Dowling said he \"would rather see the algae away\", as it is \"bad for wildlife\".\n\"You want the wildlife to thrive,\" he said.\nMs Dowling said it \"didn't look right\" and \"it is the first thing you notice\".\n\"There is too much algae,\" she added.\nLough Neagh is the largest body of fresh water in the British Isles.\nThe lough supplies half of Belfast's drinking water and 40% of Northern Ireland's overall.\nThe Northern Ireland Executive approved an action plan for the future of Lough Neagh at a meeting earlier this month.\nFollowing a private visit to Antrim Lough Shore Park on Thursday, NI Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Andrew Muir told BBC News NI's Evening Extra that the scenes at the lough were \"extremely distressing\". \n\"It\u2019s sadly unsurprising because we\u2019ve had a period here of warm weather and we shouldn\u2019t have to be at the mercy of our weather in order to have a decent environment here in Northern Ireland,\" Mr Muir said on Friday.\nHe said the situation at Lough Neagh was \"decades in the making and will be decades in the fixing\". \nMr Muir said a number of measures within the action plan have already been implemented, but he added there is a \"big issue\" with resources. \nThe minister said the situation in Lough Neagh \u201cis really a very shocking example of what happens when we don\u2019t look after our environment and we don\u2019t invest in those things\u201d.\nHe said he will make bids at the Executive's monitoring round in October for further funding for Lough Neagh. \nDeclan Allison of Friends of the Earth told Evening Extra that the situation at Lough Neagh is \"pretty shocking\". \nHe has called for an independent environmental protection agency to be set up, \"one that is independent of ministerial interference or political interference, one that can then actually enforce the law and can br",
    "A mother of two has been left paraplegic after being shot by Iranian police over an alleged violation of the country's strict hijab rules, a source with knowledge of the case has told the BBC.\n\"She is paralysed from the waist down, and doctors have said it will take months to determine whether she will be permanently paraplegic or not.\"\nArezoo Badri, 31, was driving home with her sister in the northern city of Noor on 22 July when police attempted to pull her over to confiscate her car.\nThe driver did not comply with the order to stop, prompting the officers to shoot, the police commander in Noor told Iran's state-run news agency, without naming Ms Badri.\nThe incident comes after Iranian police announced a clampdown on women defying the nation's compulsory dress code. \nThe fresh measures included using CCTV to identify female drivers failing to cover their heads and the confiscation of vehicles found to be carrying female passengers with uncovered hair.\nIt followed prolonged public outcry over the law in the wake of the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022 while being detained by Iran's morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab, or headscarf, \"improperly\".\nIt is unclear whether Ms Badri was wearing a headscarf when she was stopped by police, but her car had a confiscation notice against it - suggesting multiple alleged violations of the hijab law.\nThe BBC source said the police officer first shot at the car's tyre before targeting her directly from the driver's side. \n\"The bullet entered her lung and severely damaged her spinal cord.\"\nColonel Ahmed Amini, Noor's police chief, said the use of firearms was permitted under Iranian law.\nAfter being initially taken to a hospital in Noor, Ms Badri was transferred to a hospital in Sari, the provincial capital, for lung surgery. A week later she was taken to the Iranian capital, Tehran.\nThe bullet was only removed after 10 days, the source said.\nBoth the police and the BBC source said that Ms Badri's car windows were tinted.\nMs Badri is now in the intensive care unit of the police-owned Vali-e-Asr Hospital in Tehran and under tight security. \nAccording to the source, her family is allowed only brief visits, during which their mobile phones are confiscated. Authorities have prohibited visitors from taking photos or video of Ms Badri - though some have emerged.\nThe heavy security measures surrounding Ms Badri's hospitalisation are reminiscent of those of Armita Geravand, a 17-year-old who died in October after spending 28 days in a coma at Fajr Hospital in Tehran, following an alleged altercation with the morality police at an underground station.\nHuman rights activists said that she was assaulted for not wearing a hijab, an allegation that the Iranian government denies.\nWomen have been legally required to wear a hijab in Iran since the Islamic revolution of 1979. Penalties for infringements of the law include fines and imprisonment.\nIncidents involving the morality police - who are tasked with enforcing the law - continue to be reported while the Women, Life, Freedom movement Ms Amini's death sparked remains ongoing. \nIranian women have previously told the BBC they were still willing to defy the rule despite the increased risk of punishment.\nRecently, CCTV footage showing the violent assault of a 14-year-old girl by hijab enforcement officers in Tehran ignited widespread outrage. \nNafas Hajisharif's mother told Iran\u2019s Ensaf News that she found her daughter at a morality police station with a \"bruised face, swollen lips, a bruised neck, and torn clothes\".",
    "An antisemitism group has called for the Labour MP, Clive Lewis, to be suspended from his party.\nIt follows a post Mr Lewis wrote on X, in which he claimed a link between attacks on Palestinians in Gaza and what he called \u201crising Islamophobia\u201d in the UK. \nThe co-director of the Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS) group has described the comment as \"incendiary\" and \"inflammatory\".\nMr Lewis declined to comment.\nA Labour spokesperson said: \u201cAll complaints are treated seriously and thoroughly assessed in line with our rules and procedures.\u201d\nIn the post on Saturday, Mr Lewis, who is the MP for Norwich South, shared a link to a report in the Guardian newspaper.\nThe article said dozens of people had been reported dead following an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza. \nAlongside the link, Mr Lewis wrote: \u201cThe link between the daily inhumanity being (sic) metted out to Palestinians and rising Islamophobia in the UK, are not unconnected.\n\u201cThe inhumanity being shown to one is giving \u2018permission\u2019 for the other. These actions diminish us all.\u201d\nAlex Hearn is the co-director of LAAS, which was started by Labour members to combat what they saw as the rise of anti-Jewish sentiment in the Labour Party.\nHe said he had written to the Labour Party, calling for Mr Lewis to be suspended.\n\u201cI put in the complaint because we have been seeing a pattern from the far right and across elements of the left that have been blaming Zionists and Israelis for the unrest that has been going on across the country,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe conflict going on thousands of miles away has no connection to the domestic cases that we have.\n\u201cIn my opinion this is conspiracy fantasy. It\u2019s extremely irresponsible that a Labour official should be pouring fuel on the fire in this way.\u201d\nMr Lewis\u2019s comment came after the arrests of hundreds of people in connection with riots and anti-immigration protests across the UK.\nThe unrest followed the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July.\nMr Hearn said: \u201cI think his [Mr Lewis\u2019s] comments are dangerous because it\u2019s a fantasy that blames racism against Muslims on Jews thousands of miles away in a different country.\n\u201cWhen communities are attacking each other it\u2019s awful. What our officials should be doing is calming things down.\nMr Lewis took part in an anti-racism protest in Norwich on Saturday, in which up to 400 people gathered in the city centre.\nThe demonstration was organised as part of a national day of protest by Norwich Stand Up to Racism and Protest with Pride\nMr Lewis addressed the crowd, three days after attending another counter-protest near a hotel housing asylum seekers on the outskirts of Norwich.\nA spokesperson for the Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, was questioned by the BBC about Mr Lewis's comments.\nThey said it was \"explicitly clear that violence has no place in UK society\".\nWhen asked if Mr Lewis's comments were antisemitic, they said it was not their role to get into individual discipline. \nThey added: \"The UK\u2019s position is that we must have more aid into Gaza.\"\nIt is understood the Labour Party is taking no further action in this case.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "More than 100 Liberal Party candidates will be unable to run for council in Australia's most populous state, after a \"monumental stuff up\" saw the party miss an election nomination deadline.\nNew South Wales (NSW) officials say they legally cannot accept late entries, with one of Australia's top election analysts estimating the party is likely to lose about 50 council seats as a result.\nSeveral long-serving politicians will automatically be out of a job, and constituents of eight councils will not have a single Liberal Party candidate to vote for.\nState party director Richard Shields has apologised and blamed \"limited resources\" for the failure to complete paperwork in time.\nIn a letter to MPs, the party's state parliamentary leader Mark Speakman described the episode as \"probably the worst act of mismanagement\" in the party's history, saying Mr Shields should have asked for more resources.\nHis position is untenable, Mr Speakman added, and he has been asked to step down.\nElection analyst Ben Raue says the exact number contests affected is still to be confirmed, but he calculates the Liberal Party is 136 candidates short of a full ticket.\nIn a post on his Tally Room blog, Mr Raue said those who have missed the ballot include 38 sitting councillors.\nCurrent councillor Paul Ell - who was planning to run for mayor of the Shoalhaven City Council, in the state's south - is among those set to lose their position.\n\"It's obviously upsetting and devastating for us personally, but most of all, it's bad for local democracy in the community,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\nIn Wollongong, about 90km south of Sydney, the error has effectively ended the 13-year council career of John Dorahy, but he says he is still hopeful officials will consider leniency.\nHowever, in a statement the NSW Electoral Commission said it is bound by the law, which \"does not allow the Commission to accept a late nomination form or allow changes to forms that were submitted once the deadline has passed\".\nThe saga has sent the NSW Liberal Party into crisis, with senior Liberal MPs lining up to express their outrage.\nDeputy parliamentary leader Natalie Ward told radio station 2GB she is furious over the \"monumental stuff-up\", while Anthony Roberts told the ABC it was \"abysmal\".\n\"It's absolutely catastrophic, I've never seen - in my 30 years of public life - anything so bad,\" he said.\nIn a statement on Wednesday Mr Shields said: \"On behalf of the secretariat, I would like to apologise to Liberal-endorsed councillors that were not nominated and to the party membership more broadly.\"",
    "Young people have been sent a warning after eight fires were started in a derelict Nottingham building over the course of six weeks.\nNottinghamshire Fire and Rescue said emergency services have been responding to a growing number of deliberate fires in the city centre, specifically at the Grade-II listed Guildhall site.\nBetween 27 May and 7 July, the service reported nine incidents at the South Sherwood Street site, eight of which were deliberately set by young people.\nParents have been asked by the emergency services to talk to their children about the dangers of entering derelict buildings and starting fires.\nThe fire service said its response to the nine incidents included the use of more than 40 resources, including specialist equipment and officers, which took them away from other emergencies.\nA multi-agency preventative approach, which includes Nottingham City Council, has since been put in place to stop people from entering the building, which the service says has been successful.\nSince 7 July, fire officers have attended one incident at the Guildhall, which turned out to be a false alarm.\nAssistant chief fire officer Damien West said: \u201cStarting fires deliberately can be extremely harmful to those setting the fires, others within the local community and the environment.\n\"It\u2019s a great risk to themselves and a drain on resources for fire, police, and ambulance services.\n\u201cWe are urging parents to educate their children and know where they are at all times, especially throughout the summer holidays - it is incredibly dangerous for anyone to be playing with fire.\"\nA city council spokesperson said the authority has gone \"above and beyond the legal requirements\" of managing the vacant site.\nThey added: \u201cWe would reiterate the warnings from the fire service about breaking into vacant sites and deliberately starting fires.

    "The first British woman ever to win Olympic gold in the 800m race says Team GB's newest champion Keely Hodgkinson is in a \"class of her own\". \nAnne Packer, who now lives in Congleton, crossed the finish line in world record time when she won in 1964 - a race she almost decided to skip to go shopping. \nIn Paris on Monday, Hodgkinson dominated the field to finish in one minute 56.72 seconds.\nSpeaking to BBC North West Tonight, Packer said Hodgkinson put on a \"magnificent performance\" to become only the third female 800m gold medallist for Great Britain. \nPacker, who said she watched the race with two of her sons, said: \"It was a magnificent performance and although she had been tipped to win, all sorts of things can happen and they do.\n\"She ran a magnificent race and she was really in a class of her own.\"\nHodgkinson, from Atherton, had finished second at successive World Championships after claiming silver on her Olympic debut in Tokyo 2021.\nIn Paris, however, Hodgkinson followed in the footsteps of Packer and Dame Kelly Holmes, who won gold in Athens 2004. \nWhile the 22-year-old was a heavy favourite, Packer's win in Tokyo 1964 was much more unexpected. \nShe said she had been a favourite for the 400m event, but was beaten \"fair and square\" on the day by Australia's Betty Cuthbert. \nShe qualified for the final in the 800m, but had never run the distance at international level and suggested to her late husband, fellow athlete Robbie Brightwell, that she might go shopping.\n\"I really had no idea about how to run one and I did say to Robbie I thought I might go and get some souvenirs to take home for the family and maybe give it a miss but he wasn't having any, so there we go\", she said. \nIn the event, Packer started to fall behind but decided to go for a sprint finish for the final 150m - finishing in a then-world record time of two minutes 1.01 seconds. \n\"It was as much a shock to me as it was to the rest of the world\", she said. \nTurning back to Hodgkinson, she added: \"Keely was the main lady on the night and she delivered didn't she? \n\"There's no doubt about it that she never looked at all as if there was going to be a problem.\n\"She's a beautiful runner, and she's young and she is going to have a fantastic career.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Instagram and TikTok beauty shots are putting more strain on mountain rescuers as walkers follow social media posts and put themselves in danger, one team has said.\nOne of the main rescue teams in Wales' largest national park said it is already looking to be a record-breaking year for call outs.\nOgwen Valley Mountain Rescue's chairman Chris Lloyd said it reflected an increase in visitors to Eryri, also known as Snowdonia, and the rise in people publishing videos of the park on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube.\nBut he said those heading for the peaks need to prepare, rather than pulling up in their cars without a plan.\nThere have been at least eight recorded deaths in the last year on and around the national park's peaks.\n\"This is a superb area, with a lot of exciting and good quality countryside here, and I can understand people wanting to go out and enjoy themselves,\" said Mr Lloyd, who has been a volunteer with the Ogwen rescue team for nearly 50 years.\n\"But they really do need to think, especially when going on the mountains.\n\"Think about what the consequences are, just even if the weather changes, or you have a minor injury, or if it gets dark - you should be prepared for those consequences.\"\nThe rescue team has had to deal with a number of incidents in recent weeks of inexperienced walkers tackling the mountain Tryfan, without appreciating its technical difficulty.\nThe mountain stands at 917m [3,010ft], and is often described as a peak that marks the line between hiking and mountaineering.\nThere are no marked footpaths to the summit, and it requires using hands and scrambling skills to reach the top.\nIt was used as a training ground by Sir Edmund Hillary and his team to test oxygen equipment and safety techniques before the first ever successful climb of Everest in 1953.\nIt is also a mountain responsible for the vast majority of call outs for the Ogwen Valley team - accounting for 28% of all call-outs so far this year - including two deaths.\n\"I think things have changes, certainly all mountain rescue teams have noticed a big difference since [Covid] lockdown,\" said Mr Lloyd.\n\"I think one of the things is social media. People are doing podcasts and people have seen them and getting the idea they can go up there.\n\"But they haven't seen how that original filmer was equipped and they haven't seen how experienced he was.\n\"We are getting a number of people going up getting into difficulties because they aren't suitably equipped or experienced.\"\nThe mountain rescue teams across the national park have urged visitors to make use of online services that offer advice about enjoying the outdoors safely.\nIt includes the group Adventure Smart, which started off in Wales and now covers the Lake District and Northern Ireland.\nIt includes the group Adventure Smart, which started off in Wales now covers the Lake District and Northern Ireland.\n\"Everybody has caught the outdoor adventure bug.

    "The runaway success of Disney's Inside Out 2 has helped boost the entertainment giant's profits, but there are troubles elsewhere in the Magic Kingdom.\nIn the three months to June, Disney swung to a pre-tax profit as revenue rose, thanks in large part to the Pixar sequel becoming the highest-grossing animated film of all time.\nDisney also said its streaming business was profitable for the first time.\nHowever, analysts said the results were disappointing overall as its theme parks brought in less money than expected.\nThe Olympics in Paris, where Disneyland is based, were partly blamed for the drop in its theme park takings, which make up over half its profit. A drop in consumer spending was also blamed.\nMeanwhile, Disney said it expected lower demand in its US parks to continue in to the second half of the year.\nMedia analyst Ben Barringer at Quilter Cheviot said the limp results add \"fuel to the fire\" of fears around the American economic slowdown, which left global stock markets jittery over the weekend.\nDisney has also been under pressure as audiences move away from traditional TV viewing habits and cinema.\nAt its last financial release in May, it was banking on a crackdown on password sharing to help boost its streaming subscriber numbers.\nChief executive Bob Iger was brought out of retirement to help turn the company around, but there is much more work to be done, said Mr Barringer.\n\"We should expect further struggles through the rest of the year\", he said, as the company was still very much in \"turnaround mode\".\nHe said some of its problems were down to \"Disneyland Paris struggling due to the Olympics being in town, as well as China going through its own economic problems\".\nHowever, he said that further \"stellar returns\" could be expected from Deadpool & Wolverine's release.\nThe Marvel crossover film had an impressive opening weekend in the US \u2013 and became the eighth-biggest opening ever and best of the year so far.\n\"After several years of misfires and muted successes, Disney has now in the span of a month and a half released the highest grossing animated film of all time and achieved the largest ever opening for an R-Rated film,\" Moffett Nathanson media analyst Robert Fishman wrote ahead of Disney's earnings release.\nHowever, he added that \"it remains to be seen whether those successes represent a return to form\" as it relies on \"highly dependable titles\" including Moana 2, Mufasa: The Lion King to bring in audiences over the coming months.\nAlthough its streaming business did well in the US and Canada, its business in India saw a 6% decline from the previous year.",

And now here, I thought I was going to die last night.\"\nAsked what he would say to people concerned about public money being spent on asylum seekers, the 17-year-old said: \"I was forced to escape, I want to have a peaceful life.\n\"I am not after money; I just want to live, just live.\"\nTalking about police, he stated: \"Until the day I die I won\u2019t forget their help. The police helped us a lot.\"\nStaffordshire Police said six of their officers were assaulted during violence in Tamworth and Stoke-on-Trent at the weekend.\nTen people had been arrested, and two charged, said the force, and \"more will come\".\nPolice have set up a portal for people with pictures, video and other evidence to get in touch.\nAssistant Chief Constable Stuart Ellison said: \u201cPolice forces across the country all have the same message for the individuals involved in these incidents: you are being pursued and we are working around the clock to find you.\"\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A Royal Air Force veteran hopes to raise enough money for a canine companion to help him through cancer treatment. \nAfter being diagnosed with incurable mantle cell lymphoma, Mark Towle, from Peterborough, said a You Tube channel featuring therapy dogs brought some joy back into his life. \nEllie Golden Life, featuring two US-based therapy dogs, became a highlight for Mr Towle and his wife Jessica and planted the seed of an idea.\nMrs Towle arranged for the famous golden retrievers to surprise Mark. Upon their meeting she said all the fear, anxiety and tension he was holding onto \"just melted away\".\nNow, the couple are hoping to raise money for Mr Towle to have his own dog.\nMr Towle was in the RAF for 17 years before taking voluntary redundancy and re-training as a plumber.\nIn 2012 he suffered a herniated disc which resulted in major spinal surgery but he returned to work within three months. \nFive years later he was involved in a head-on collision which left him with post-traumatic stress disorder as well as destroying his power tools and equipment. \nHe rebuilt his business and returned to work in 2018, until the pandemic hit. Following that, he began rebuilding his business for the fourth time when he began experiencing \"some strange physical symptoms\". \nMr Towle was diagnosed with an aggressive and incurable cancer which led to months of radiotherapy and intense chemotherapy and he was forced to close down his business.\nIn February 2023 he was admitted to Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge for a stem cell transplant.\nDuring his time in hospital, Mrs Towle discovered Ellie Golden Life set up by Kevin and Katie Bubolz, of Washington DC.\nEach morning, she sent Mr Towle a video of the dogs featured on the channel, Ellie and Emma, and it became a daily highlight during treatment. \n\"Without knowing it, these beautiful dogs played a huge part in Mark\u2019s incredible recovery,\" she said.\nDuring Summer 2023, Mr Towle found out he was in remission after a successful stem cell transplant and Mrs Towle contacted Mr and Mrs Bubolz to thank them for the work they do.\n\"Incidentally, they were planning a trip with Ellie and Emma and we arranged a surprise for Mark,\" Mrs Towle said.\n\"In that special moment, I saw first-hand the impact a dog would have on Mark. \n\"I noticed his whole body relax and let go. He felt calm, safe and no longer afraid of the uncertainty that comes with an incurable cancer diagnosis. \n\"That was the moment I knew I had to do all that I could to find Mark\u2019s one-day-dog.\"\nShe hoped a canine companion could help Mr Towle improve his physical and psychological well-being following two-and-a-half years of treatment.\n\"We haven't called it a battle or a fight, we approach it with optimism and an upbeat mindset... and dark humour,\" she said. \nFollow Peterborough news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "As the saying goes, wait hours for a bus and two come at once.\nWait years for an All-Island Strategic Rail Review, and you get 32 recommendations including new or restored railway lines on both sides of the border.\nAmong the recommendations is a 50-year old plan to create a railway link at Belfast International Airport.\nSo why has it taken so long - and how likely is it that any of the review's grand ambitions will ever become a reality?\nAs well as a station at the airport, created by reopening the Antrim-Lisburn line, there would be more intercity services, reinstatement of lines including from Londonderry to Portadown and Portadown to Armagh, a new station at Craigavon and cross-border connections from Londonderry to Letterkenny and from Armagh to Monaghan.\nThere are also plans to build a higher-speed railway from Belfast to Newry, with new stations at Dromore and Banbridge.\nSome elements of the review are already being acted on, with the construction of the new Grand Central Station in Belfast and plans to increase the frequency of services between Belfast and Dublin.\nCome 2050, the journey from north-west to south-east and beyond should look very different to how it is now and making that trip by rail would be a serious option.\nBut none of this would come cheap.\nThe all-island costs are estimated between \u20ac35bn (\u00a329bn) and \u20ac37bn (\u00a331bn) in 2023 terms, with Northern Ireland committed to paying 25%.\nThe review says that works out at roughly \u00a3310m a year over the 25-year span of the review.\nAs we all know, the \"money tree\" has not been liberally fruiting in recent years and every department has been asked to make savings.\nThe \u00a3310m a year that the review requires of Northern Ireland is for rail alone.\nPrincipal economist at Ulster University's Economic Policy Centre, Dr Eoin Magennis, said it was significantly more than is normally spent, not just on rail.\n\"In any given year, our budget for bus, rail and ports as well is about \u00a3250m, spent on the three of those together,\" he said. \n\"So to raise that up to \u00a3300m for rail alone is certainly ambitious.\n\"Other priorities would come under pressure or would have to be looked at.\n\"Some of that could be in loans from the European Investment Bank, but nonetheless you're talking significant investment.\"\nThat means tough choices.\nStormont Infrastructure Minister John O'Dowd told BBC News NI the funds are available.\nHe said it was about \u201cdecisions I will make and future ministers and the executive will make about how this plan is implemented\".\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have any choice,\" he said.\n\u201cClimate change is a reality and we have to change how we transport people and goods.\n\u201cRail is a great way of doing that.\u201d\nDr Magennis is cautious, given the need for a ringfenced capital budget.\nHe said it was difficult to see network operator Northern Ireland Railways being able to come up with the money without fare increases or a change in how it operated.\nHe also said it was important to consider other forms of public transport, including buses.\nThe big driver is climate change and targets for reducing emissions that are now legally obliged to be met.\nTransport is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in Northern Ireland.\nAnd it was one of only two sectors to show increases in emissions compared to the base year of 1990.\nDecarbonising the rail network by moving mostly to electric trains, with the remainder running on a hybrid of electricity and hydrogen, is an easy win to cut emissions.\nMaking rail more accessible and more widely available should also, in theory, encourage more people to leave the car at home.\nIt is a big shift from thinking in the 20th century, said Ulster University historian Emmet O'Connor.\nIn the 1920s there were 32 mostly loss-making railways and these were gradually cut back to just two, partly due to the impact of the partition of the island into Northern Ireland and the modern-day Republic of Ireland.\n\"The argument was that they weren't making any money, they weren't likely to make any money in the foreseeable future, people were switching to road transport and making use of the car,\" he said.\n\"They simply weren't thinking ahead.\"\nBut he said the tide had turned.\n\"I think there's a recognition that the railway is the way of the future for environmental reasons, but also for social and economic reasons,\" he said.\nThe aim of the review is to create a future-proofed 21st-century transport system that works for the whole island and gives people the freedom to move around without doing harm to the environment while also creating choice, convenience, accessibility and practicality.\nOne place that would not be connected is Fermanagh.\nBy 2050 when the recommendations of the review are implemented, it would be the only county in the UK and Ireland with no train line.\nThat makes this an \"interim\" review for engineer Karen McShane.\n\"What you're doing is looking to 2050 to achieve the climate change targets, so you're implementing what you know will be used a",
    "Like every morning, there was tension. \nIt crackled in the air like static. So much was happening lately that only a fool would walk into the hills and not be on their guard. \nThe sun was already high, pulsing heat across the stillness of the land. There was the sound of the animals\u2019 bells, men and boys whistling to call in the dogs. \nHigh on the hill opposite was the Jewish settlement of Rotem. Close by was an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) post. There to protect the settlers. \nAnybody looking down would see the gathering at Ahmad Daraghme\u2019s home: the Palestinian shepherd; the Israeli activists who support him; the foreign journalists with their camera.\nChatting to Ahmad was a 71-year-old Jewish man who regularly accompanies the shepherd into the hills, in spite of violence and harassment. \nA man who, I sense, is not going to back down from any fight he believes to be righteous. \u201cWhen I am convinced that my positions are true, I am ready to fight for my beliefs. Call it stubborn? All right,\u201d says Gil Alexander.\nHe belongs to the Jordan Valley Activists, a group of Israelis committed to protecting Palestinians. They accompany shepherds to and from the grazing lands. \nMaybe the settlers would appear around al-Farisiyah this morning, maybe not. The harassment was more frequent since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 Israelis and kidnapping 251. \nSettler violence that had been going on for years in the West Bank was escalating sharply, aimed, the Palestinians believe, at driving them off the land. \nAccording to OCHA - the UN office for Humanitarian Affairs - there have been more than 1,000 attacks by settlers against Palestinians since October, with at least 1,390 people - including 660 children - displaced.\nLethal violence has frequently accompanied the attacks. OCHA recorded 107 that led to Palestinian fatalities and injuries, 859 causing damage to Palestinian property.  \nThousands of trees and saplings belonging to Palestinians have been destroyed. Farmers like Ahmad describe how access to water for families, crops and herds is regularly blocked or limited.\nInternational attention has been focused on Gaza, but the scale of settler violence prompted the US, the EU and Britain to impose sanctions on some settler leaders and, for the first time, against entire settler outposts.\nThe activists in the Jordan Valley understand that the important thing is to stay calm. No matter how much provocation there is. \nGil Alexander knows what the settlers are capable of, even when no resistance is offered. He has the scars to prove it. But this morning he is upbeat.\n\u201cA day like this,\u201d he says, \u201cit makes me feel good. If we can prevent attacks that gives me satisfaction.\u201d  \nGil has become a good friend of Ahmad Daraghme, who\u2019s been harassed repeatedly. Ahmad accuses the Israeli army and police of taking the side of the settlers, a claim supported by numerous reports by Israeli and Palestinian human rights activists.\nPointing to the hills, around him, down to the main road, Ahmad says: \u201cThe problem is\u2026all this land is forbidden for us. This hill is forbidden, all of it is forbidden. This situation is a mess: it doesn\u2019t matter if we have permission or we don't, they are always creating problems for us.\u201d\nWe climbed up into the hills, over rocks and gullies, until a valley opened out below us. The land was auburn coloured, covered with dried stalks of recently cut corn, good fodder for hungry sheep. \nAhmad was ahead of us on his donkey, leading the flock towards the grazing land, as his forefathers had done for generations. \nA mountain deer flickered through the heat haze and vanished. The picture was of a pastoral eden. In reality it is a bitter battleground.\nLast December Gil Alexander and another activist were with Ahmad when settlers attacked at night. They were badly beaten and pepper sprayed. \nIn an incident elsewhere in the valley Gil collapsed to the ground trying to prevent a settler from scattering a Palestinian flock.\nHe has experienced constant threats. The fact that he is a devout religious Jew infuriates the settlers, who believe the West Bank - the ancient lands of Judea and Samaria - belong to the Jewish people.\nGil is the son of French Jews and emigrated to Israel when he was 20. His father fought in the French Resistance against the Nazis. \u201cI feel like a representative of a humanitarian religious Judaism,\u201d Gil says. \"There are few today in Israel.\"\nThe Palestinians like Ahmad Daraghme have lived under occupation since Israel conquered the territory in the Six Day War of 1967. \nSince then over 160 settlements have been built in the Occupied Territories - including East Jerusalem - with around 700,000 Jewish residents. There are approximately three million Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\nFor Gil Alexander, who describes himself as a Zionist, Israeli territory should end at the 1967 borders. Any settlements in the West Bank should only exist with Palestinian consent.  \n\u201dWe can",
    "On 2 October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's government, walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was murdered. \nIn the months that followed, conflicting narratives emerged over how he died, what happened to his remains, and who was responsible.\nSaudi officials said the journalist was killed in a \"rogue operation\" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom, while Turkish officials said the agents acted on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi government. \nAs a prominent Saudi journalist, he covered major stories, including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of the late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, for various Saudi news organisations.\nFor decades, the 59-year-old was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government.\nBut he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of King Salman and Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.\nIn his first column for the Post in September 2017, Khashoggi said he had feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince. \nKhashoggi first visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 28 September 2018 to obtain a Saudi document stating that he was divorced, so that he could marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz.\nBut he was told he would have to return to pick up the document and arranged to come back on 2 October.\n\"He did not believe that something bad could happen on Turkish soil,\" Ms Cengiz wrote in the Post.\nMs Cengiz accompanied him to the entrance of the consulate on 2 October. He was last seen on CCTV footage entering the building at 13:14 local time.\nDespite reassuring friends that he would not face any problems inside, he gave Ms Cengiz two mobile phones and told her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not come back out.\nShe ultimately waited for more than 10 hours outside the consulate and returned the following morning when Khashoggi had still not reappeared.\nFor more than two weeks, Saudi Arabia consistently denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's fate. \nPrince Mohammed told Bloomberg News that the journalist had left the consulate \"after a few minutes or one hour\". \"We have nothing to hide,\" he added.\nBut in a change of tune on 20 October, the Saudi government said a preliminary investigation by prosecutors had concluded that the journalist died during a \"fight\" after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. Later, a Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold.\nOn 15 November, Saudi Arabia's deputy public prosecutor Shalaan al-Shalaan said the murder was ordered by the head of a \"negotiations team\" sent to Istanbul by the Saudi deputy intelligence chief to bring Khashoggi back to the kingdom \"by means of persuasion\" or, if that failed, \"by force\".\nInvestigators concluded that Khashoggi was forcibly restrained after a struggle and injected with a large amount of a drug, resulting in an overdose that led to his death, Mr Shalaan said. His body was then dismembered and handed over to a local \"collaborator\" outside the consulate for disposal, he added.  \nFive individuals had confessed to the murder, Mr Shalaan asserted, adding: \"[The crown prince] did not have any knowledge about it.\"\nThe Saudi public prosecution said in late September 2018 that a total of 31 individuals were investigated over the killing and that 21 of them were arrested. \nFive senior government officials were also sacked, including Deputy Intelligence Chief Ahmad Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani, a senior aide to Prince Mohammed. \nIn January 2019, 11 individuals - who have not been named - were put on trial at the Riyadh Criminal Court in connection with Khashoggi's murder, and the public prosecutor sought the death penalty for five of them. \nHuman Rights Watch said the trial, which took place behind closed doors, did not meet international standards and that authorities \"obstructed meaningful accountability\".\nIn December 2019, the court sentenced five individuals to death for \"committing and directly participating in the murder of the victim\". Three others were handed prison sentences totalling 24 years for \"covering up this crime and violating the law\", while the remaining three were found not guilty. \nThe public prosecution said Mr Asiri was tried but acquitted \"due to insufficient evidence\", while Mr Qahtani was investigated over the killing but not charged.\nAt a news conference following the verdict, Shalaan al-Shalaan said the public prosecution's investigation had shown that \"the killing was not premeditated\".\nMs Callamard dismissed that assertion as \"utterly ridiculous\" and said the trial represented \"the antithesis of justice\", from which the \"masterminds\" walked free.\nBut Khashoggi's son Salah, who lives in Saudi Arabia, tweeted: \"We affirm"
