    "Canada has announced plans to again delay an expansion to its medical assistance in dying (maid) programme for people who have a mental illness.\nIt comes after a parliamentary committee recommended a pause on the expansion, which was originally set to come into effect on 17 March.\nOttawa had also been warned by the provinces that they had not had time to properly prepare.\nLegislation was tabled on Thursday to delay the expansion to 2027.\nThe government \"has heard - and agrees - that the health system is not yet ready for this expansion\", Health Canada said in a statement.\nConcerns have been raised by provinces across the country, which oversee healthcare services, about whether the system is ready and robust enough to handle the expansion.\nSpeaking on Thursday in Ottawa, federal Health Minister Mark Holland said the government accepts the equivalency of mental suffering and physical suffering, but that it is a \"question of readiness\".\nHe said his provincial counterparts, as well as Canada's largest mental health hospital - the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) - \"feel that they need more time to be able to look at this\".\nCAMH has previously said that doctors and nurses are concerned they are not yet adequately trained to determine whether someone with mental illness qualifies for euthanasia.\nThe legislation Mr Holland tabled allows for a review in two years to reassess the readiness of the system.\nThe expansion has been delayed twice. Last year, the country paused it for one year, to this March.\nAdvocacy group Dying with Dignity said on Thursday it was \"disheartened\" over this second pause, calling it a \"denial of constitutional rights for suffering people across Canada\".\nIn 2021, Canada loosened its euthanasia laws to no longer require that a patient's condition be terminally ill, allowing people whose condition is serious and incurable to request it.\nThe number of medically-assisted deaths in Canada has risen significantly since it was first introduced, from 1,018 in 2016 to more than 13,241 in 2022. That year, maid deaths accounted for about 4.1% of all deaths in the country.\nAuthorities rejected 3.5% of written requests for euthanasia in Canada in 2022, the most recent available statistics.\nThe average age across the country for individuals seeking medically assisted dying in that year was 77 years old, with cancer being the most cited underlying medical condition for those looking to die.\nThe province of Quebec has the highest percentage of medically-assisted deaths, accounting for 6.6% of all deaths in 2022.\nLast year the province's end-of-life care regulator, Dr Michel Bureau, sent a memo to doctors reminding them that only patients with serious and incurable diseases were eligible for maid, and that two physicians must approve a request to die before it is granted.\n\"We see, more and more, that the cases receiving medical aid in dying are approaching the limits of the law,\" Dr Bureau, president of Quebec's commission on end-of-life-care, said in an interview with the Canadian Press in 2023.\n\"It's no longer just terminal cancer, there are all kinds of illnesses - and that's very good, but it requires a lot of rigour from doctors to ensure they stay within the limits of the law.\"\nOther countries, like Belgium and the Netherlands, have allowed euthanasia for psychiatric patients since 2002, but under exceptionally stringent conditions.",
    "US President Joe Biden has approved sanctions on four Israeli settlers accused of attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\nMr Biden signed a broad executive order, saying violence in the West Bank had reached \"intolerable levels\".\nThe sanctions block the individuals from accessing all US property, assets and the American financial system.\nViolence in the West Bank has spiked since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October.\nSome 370 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since then, according to the UN. The majority of those have been killed by Israeli forces but at least eight of them have been killed by Israeli settlers, the UN said.\nThe new executive order means the US government has the power to sanction any foreign nationals who attack, intimidate or seize the property of Palestinians.\nThe sanctions are a first by the US administration - a rare step targeting Israelis - and comes as Mr Biden travels to the state of Michigan, which has a large Arab-American population that has been critical of his support for Israel.\nThe Arab American Institute, an advocacy group, earlier said that since the start of the conflict, support by Arab Americans for the Democratic Party has plummeted from 59% in 2020 to just 17%.\nOn Thursday, a senior official in the Biden administration said the president had repeatedly raised concerns with Israel about violence by settlers.\nThe executive order sets out the groundwork for how the US will respond to further attacks in the West Bank, and is an escalation compared to the visa restrictions it imposed on some individuals last year.\n\"The situation in the West Bank - in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction - has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security and stability\" of the region, Mr Biden said in a letter to Congress explaining his reasoning.\nA senior administration official said the initial round of sanctions - targeting four people - were against \"individuals that have directly perpetrated violence and those who have engaged in repeated acts of intimidation, property destruction, leading to the forced displacement of Palestinian communities\".\nThey said one person initiated and led a riot that led to the death of a Palestinian civilian in the town of Huwara, while another had attacked people with stones and clubs.\nThey added that the executive order was \"non-discriminatory\" and applied to both Israelis and Palestinians who direct or take part in violent acts or threats against civilians, intimidation, destroying, seizing property or terrorism.\nThe US Treasury named the four sanctioned Israelis as David Chai Chasdai, 29; Yinon Levi 31; Einan Tanjil, 21; and Shalom Zicherman 32. Three of them lived in West Bank settlements and one lived near the occupied region's border, the Treasury said.\nThese US sanctions cannot be applied to American citizens, some of whom are thought to be involved in the violence.\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the US does believes the sanctions \"will have an impact on these four individuals\" and expects Israel to \"do more to hold accountable those responsible for settler violence\".\nShortly after Mr Biden signed the executive order, Israel signalled its dissatisfaction and described the majority of West Bank settlers as \"law-abiding\".\n\"Israel takes action against all law-breakers everywhere, and therefore there is no need for unusual measures on the issue,\" a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.\nThe response was yet another sign of a deepening public rift between the US and Israel.\nThe two leaders are long-term allies, but have disagreed in recent weeks about the idea of creating an independent Palestinian state. The US believes a Palestinian state alongside Israel - known as a \"two-state solution\" - is vital for long-term stability in the region.\nMr Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea, and the White House acknowledged last month that the US and Israeli governments \"clearly see things differently\".\nThose comments dampened hopes in some circles that the conflict could result in Israeli and Palestinian leaders restarting diplomatic negotiations and kickstarting the dormant peace process.",
    "Hollywood stars Henry Cavill and Samuel L Jackson aren't easily upstaged, but it was Claudia Schiffer's cat who stole the show at a film premiere.\nDua Lipa, Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston and Bryce Dallas Howard were among the stars attending the launch of spy film Argylle in London's Leicester Square.\nBut Schiffer brought along her cat Chip, who appears in the film and hoovered up all the media attention.\nPhotos from the night were posted to Chip's 13,000 followers on Instagram.\nThe cat could be seen through a perspex dome in Schiffer's argyle-patterned backpack cat carrier - complete with plenty of air holes.\nThese backpacks are custom-made so cats can be transported safely - cat owners inspired by Schiffer and Chip should not put their pets into ordinary backpacks.\nOther stars at the London premiere included John Cena, Ariana DeBose, Sofia Boutella, Rob Delaney, Jing Lusi, Matthew Vaughn.\nVaughn, who has been married to Schiffer since 2002, directed the film, which is released in the UK next month.\nIn the film, Chip plays the role of Alfie, the cat belonging to spy novelist Elly - played by Howard.\nShe and her cat are saved from being kidnapped after her books begin to depict the activities of a sinister underground group.",
    "The Spanish region of Catalonia has declared a state of emergency as it faces its worst drought on record.\nFrom Thursday residents will be banned from washing their cars and filling up empty swimming pools under a measure brought in to tackle the crisis.\nMore than six million Catalans will be affected across 200 towns and cities, including the capital Barcelona.\nThe restrictions were announced after reservoirs fell to close to 16% of their capacity.\n\"It's still not raining,\" Anna Cas\u00c3\u00b2liva Freixe told the BBC, looking out of the window of her bakery. \"It's worrying if you don't have enough water.\"\nAnna lives and works in Berga, a town high up in the mountains north of Barcelona which has been hit hard by the drought.\n\"We need water to make bread - we need water to make the dough,\" she said. \"But we need it at home as well: for the washing machine, to shower and so on.\"\nSpain is familiar with dry conditions and other areas of the country are also suffering droughts, including Andalusia in the south and the eastern region of Valencia.\nHowever, Catalonia, which borders southern France, is less used to such conditions, forcing officials to consider bringing in water by ship to Barcelona should it run dry. This measure was previously adopted in 2008.\nOther initial emergency restrictions will include a sharp reduction in the use of water for crop farming and industry, and the capping of water supplies per inhabitant per day.\nTown halls can face fines for flouting these limits and there is scope for the restrictions to be increased further.\nJust a few kilometres away from Berga, the impact of the drought is all too visible. The la Baells reservoir, along with others in the Ter-Llobregat basin system, provides water for Barcelona and dozens of surrounding towns.\nIts currently filled far below capacity, with its parched banks exposed.\n\"Barcelona and its surrounding area are home to five or six million people and that population density makes it a very vulnerable area,\" Anna Barnadas, secretary for climate action in the Catalan government, told the BBC.\nShe said that a Catalan government drought strategy, drawn up in 2021, had already diversified the region's water supply, making it less reliant on reservoirs and wells. Some restrictions on water use have already been in place.\nSuch measures, Ms Barnadas said, allowed the authorities to delay the emergency measures.\n\"We realise that the state of emergency affects all sectors, it affects the whole population and so it means, in this case, introducing some major restrictions,\" she said.\n\"It has been a priority for us to delay the state of emergency but it is impossible to avoid it.\"\nMs Barnadas said it was too soon to be able to know whether the drought could be attributed to climate change, although the Catalan government believes that to be the case.\nClimate change does not cause all droughts, but increased heat in the atmosphere exacerbates dry spells. Temperatures in the Mediterranean region are increasing 20% faster than the global average, according to the UN and rises are expected to continue unless there are drastic cuts to emissions.\nIn Barcelona itself, the drought's impact is less visible than in the nearby mountains. But decorative fountains in the city have been switched off for the last year, and the watering of public and private gardens is mostly prohibited.\n\"I try to save water in my daily life, having quick showers and this kind of thing,\" one local resident, Silvia Mart\u00c3\u00adnez, told the BBC.\n\"But I'm afraid this this is going to be something that is normal in the future.\"\nBarcelona's status as Spain's top tourist destination raises the question as to how it would handle the high season if the drought were to continue into the summer. More than 12 million people visited the city in 2023 and Marta Dom\u00c3\u00a8nech i Tom\u00c3\u00a0s, director general of tourism for the government of Catalonia, told the BBC that 2024 could see even more visitors.\nShe said that the region was \"really well prepared\" to receive tourists despite the drought and that the industry was making adjustments to adapt to the shortage of water.\nHotels have been taking measures which range from informing guests about the need for careful water use, to installing water counters in bathrooms and encouraging guests to reuse sheets and towels.\nHowever, the mood among many Catalans is that things will get worse before they get better.\n\"It's one of those things where they've been warning us for some time but we don't take much notice, and so we carry on with our normal lives,\" said local man Pep Soler, as he headed to work in central Barcelona.\nHe added: \"We're too used to certain privileges which aren't altogether necessary and we need to reduce how much water we use.\"",
    "Financial decisions made in the run up to Woking Borough Council's effective bankruptcy could be published in March, accountants have said.\nCouncillors had pledged to publish the documents showing decisions made since 2016.\nThe council has completed an internal review and said the move would increase \"decision-making transparency\".\nBut the papers will only be made public once auditors have completed their own investigation.\nWoking Borough Council effectively declared itself bankrupt in June, saying it could not balance its budget.\nLast week, its leader warned of a \"complex\" financial crisis facing the authority as it revealed plans to cut services.\nAccountancy firm Grant Thornton LLP has been examining Woking's books following a government intervention in May.\nJoanne Brown, director of public sector assurance at Grant Thornton LLP, said it had concluded the fieldwork and was finalising a report, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).\nShe said the company had to consult with interested parties before the report could be published, which she appreciated \"may be frustrating for residents of Woking, the council and other stakeholders who are keen to see the report's findings\".\nHowever, \"the approach we are following is both important and necessary,\" she added.\nThe documents, which contain commercially sensitive information, are usually confidential.\nIn a statement, the council said it was publishing the historic papers so people could better understand the decisions and actions that had contributed to its current financial challenges.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

    "The US economy grew faster than expected in the final months of last year, driven by robust household and government spending.\nThe world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% over the three months to December, the Commerce Department said.\nThat was down from 4.9% in the prior quarter, but much faster than the 2% many analysts had expected.\nFor 2023, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.5%, up from 1.9% in 2022.\nThe figures cap a year that has been characterised by unexpected economic resilience, even as the US central bank raised borrowing costs sharply and inflation cooled.\n\"Whichever way you slice it, this report caps a year of stellar economic growth performance,\" said Olu Sonola, head of US regional economics at Fitch Ratings. \"The momentum of economic growth going into 2024 is looking very good.\"\nThe figures are a boon for US President Joe Biden, who has struggled to convince the public that the economy remains healthy, as it downshifts from the boom after the pandemic shock.\nIn a speech in Wisconsin on Thursday, he argued that White House policies, including investments in green energy, roads and other infrastructure, have contributed to the resilience.\n\"Experts, from the time I got elected, were insisting that the recession was just around the corner,\" he said. \"Well, we've got really strong growth.... We obviously have more work to do but we're making real progress.\"\nMr Biden said he believed the message was starting to get through.\nIn recent months, surveys have shown consumer sentiment improving. The stock market is up, petrol prices are down and unemployment remains low.\nWhile the jump in prices since 2019 remains a sticking point for voters, the inflation rate has also eased, falling to 3.4% in December, after soaring to more than 9% in 2022.\nCalifornia resident Ha Le said she was conscious of no longer being on a constant lookout for the lowest cost petrol.\nBut the 44-year-old, a corporate worker in the retail industry and a Democrat, said it was still difficult to accept the big jump in grocery and child care prices of the last few years.\n\"My general thoughts on the economy are that it's not the worst, right? We've recovered somewhat from the pandemic terror, but it's not great,\" she said.\nMany economists had expected households to cut back spending as prices eroded their budgets and for business activity to cool in the face of more expensive borrowing costs, warning of the risks of a downturn, or recession.\nBut that scenario has not materialised, as high savings left over from the pandemic, an uptick in wage growth, and other government spending provided a cushion. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, the US economy grew 3.1%.\nOn Wall Street, the improving picture has led to speculation that the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates sharply to fight inflation, might start to reverse course.\nBut analysts said the strength of the economy portrayed in the report on gross domestic product (GDP) will relieve pressure on the bank to act quickly.\n\"Those hunting for clues that the Federal Reserve is ready to take an axe to interest rates will be sorely disappointed,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.",

    "As the Japanese Space Agency put it: \"Operations resumed!\"\nAfter the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) re-established contact with its Moon lander on Sunday night, the craft started to study its surroundings in detail and transmit new images to Earth.\nThe lander is carrying out analysis that could inform future, much longer missions to the Moon.\nOne lunar scientist told BBC News: \"Now we're really seeing the science.\"\nThe craft is at a very awkward angle. A picture, captured by the small baseball-sized robot called Sora-Q - which was ejected from Slim moments before touchdown - showed the lander face-down on the lunar surface.\nThat left its solar panels facing away from the sunlight and unable to generate power. The decision was taken to put the lander into sleep mode - and conserve what power remained -  less than three hours after it landed.\nThat tactic appears to have worked. A change in the direction of the sunlight has now \"awoken\" the craft.\nThe mission team had already been able to study images of the landing site and have picked out specific rocks in the area and given each one the name of a dog breed - apparently to give an indication of the size of each rock. On Monday, the team released a grey, rocky close-up image - this was the lander's scientific camera zooming in on a rock that has been named \"toy poodle\".\nIt might not look like a spectacular photograph, but the snapshot was taken with what is called the Multi-Band Camera or MBC, which can essentially capture images that reveal the composition of the rock.\n\"The camera responds differently - in different wavelengths - to each of the minerals that are in this rock,\" explained Open University lunar scientist Dr Simeon Barber.\nSeeing that will enable scientists to build up a picture of the Moon's history. \"If toy poodle is completely different to the rocks around it, that might suggest it was transported there by an impact event,\" explained Dr Barber. \"So all this detail allows us to piece together more about what's happened on the Moon since it was formed.\"\nBeing able to pinpoint rocks and examine them in this way could also reveal substances on the lunar surface that future missions might be able to use to make fuel or provide a water supply.\n\"This detailed geology is the cherry on the icing on the cake,\" said Dr Barber. \"[The mission is] already a success in my mind - I think engineering so far has been fantastic.\"\nIt is not yet clear how long the craft will be able to operate - it all hinges on the angle of the Sun and solar panels.\nThe Sun will eventually set on the lander and Jaxa has previously warned that it was not designed to survive a lunar night, when the surface of the Moon is not exposed to the Sun for about 14 days.\nBut mission engineers have already achieved their pinpoint landing target of getting within 100m (330ft) of their intended landing site.",
    "Sports bodies in Scotland are being warned to improve diversity or face government intervention.\nBBC Scotland News has learned more than three quarters of sports bodies who receive public funding have no ethnically diverse board members.\nOf the 47 sports receiving Scottish government funding, only wrestling is chaired by someone from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background.\nLess than a fifth of those running the bodies are women.\nThe figures were provided by the governing bodies themselves to Sportscotland and obtained by the BBC.\nSport Minister Maree Todd said she did not believe the figures would improve without intervention.\n\"We need to find out what the barriers are and take them away. We absolutely recognise it's an area we need to improve on,\" she said.\n\"I'm a West Highland woman - It's a man's world and it's a white man's world,\" she added.\nMs Todd said the Scottish government could consider imposing diversity targets on governing bodies who receive public money.\n\"I'm more of a carrot rather than a stick minister and I want to reward the good work that's going on,\" she said.\nDisappointing figures\nThe chief executive of Sportscotland, Forbes Dunlop, said he was not surprised by the figures.\n\"These are things we track and monitor over a period of time. Just because I'm not surprised, doesn't mean I'm not disappointed by them or motivated by them to do more,\" he said.\n\"Over the last two years, since the publication of the report into Scottish cricket, we've done a huge amount of work to change the conversation.\"\nAn independent review into Scottish cricket in 2023 found the sport's leadership to be institutionally racist.\nSince then, the sport has appointed a new board and set targets regarding equality and diversity.\nBut after the report was released, the Scottish government admitted the problems identified in cricket were likely to exist in other sports.\nVasile Jornea, who started wrestling at the age of seven, arrived in Scotland from Moldova in 2015.\nHe joined a local club in Glasgow and then became a referee before getting involved in sports management.\nMr Jornea is now the development director at Scottish Wrestling.\n\"There are a lot of people from ethnic minorities in Scotland and having someone leading the sport will definitely give bigger exposure to the sport for other people,\" he said.\n\"It's showing that everybody is welcome.

    "The government's command paper is fundamentally about trying to reassure unionists.\nPart of that is a restatement of what the government sees as the economic benefits of the union.\n\"Insufficient attention has been paid to the vital importance of that economic union in the values and identities of many unionists in Northern Ireland,\" the paper, published on Wednesday, states.\nEntitled Safeguarding the Union , the command paper was presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris.\nAside from the new guarantees about the smooth flow of trade across the Irish Sea, the 76-page paper pulls together a variety of economic initiatives.\nOne of those has a long history: the attempt to get corporation tax devolved to Northern Ireland.\nIn 2015, a law was passed to do just that, but it has never been put into practice.\nOne major problem is that if you devolve a tax and then cut it, as Stormont ministers intended, you will be sending less money to the UK Treasury.\nSo in turn the Treasury will cut the block grant - the money it sends to Northern Ireland for public services.\nStormont and the Treasury were never able to agree how big that cut should be or it how should be implemented.\nNow we have a fresh commitment to \"a rapid, focused process, supported by the necessary resource from HM Treasury, on the implementation of corporation tax devolution\".\nThe question remains - will the Treasury be prepared to cut a deal which doesn't involve a raid on the block grant?\nNorthern Ireland is also getting an investment zone - this is a \"levelling up\" policy which provide grants and tax breaks to a region.\nIt is understood the zone will cover all of Northern Ireland, though the tax breaks will be more narrowly focused.\nThe NI investment zone is described as \"enhanced\" which reflects the fact that it comes with grants and tax incentives of \u00c2\u00a3150m compared to the \u00c2\u00a380m attached to zones in England.\nSymbolic legal change\nThere are some smaller commitments: a review to look at how Northern Ireland could tap into UK defence spending and a \u00c2\u00a310m pot to support infrastructure developments at Northern Ireland's ports.\nThe paper also announces a symbolic legal change which concerns Northern Ireland's economy and which harks back to Theresa May's government.\nIn 2017, she agreed the Joint Report, a sort of interim Brexit deal which contains a fleeting reference to the \"the all-island economy\" - meaning the island of Ireland.\nThe UK's 2018 Withdrawal Act requires ministers to have \"due regard\" to that Joint Report and therefore that concept of the all-island economy.\nThe command paper says the all-island economy is a \"new political construct\" which is \"divisive in nature\" and has therefore got to go from UK law.\nThe government said it will repeal the relevant bit of the Withdrawal Act 2018 meaning \"a full and complete repeal of all statutory duties relating to the all-island economy\".",
    "Record high costs of car insurance could tempt more young people to commit fraud, the industry has said.\nRecent data showed average policy quotes for 17 to 24-year-olds stood close to \u00c2\u00a33,000.\nBut the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB) has warned against \"fronting\" , where someone is added to a policy as a named driver when they should have one of their own, in order to save money.\nFronting is fraudulent and the IFB says it is never worth the risk.\nIf evidence of fronting is found, it would invalidate your insurance policy and could result in a criminal conviction.\n'Outrageous' quotes\nTypically, insuring younger drivers has always cost more because of the risks associated with their inexperience.\nOften, they are added to their parents' policy as a named driver even though they are the main driver of the car.\nThe Association of British Insurers (ABI) says a main driver just has to be the person who drives the car the majority of the time.\nAn IFB survey last year revealed a quarter of 18 to 24-year-olds would find it acceptable to lie on an insurance application to save money - although many may be aware that fronting is illegal.\n\"With prices rising, we understand more young people will be tempted to front on their car insurance to save money, but fronting is never worth the risk,\" Jon Radford, head of intelligence, investigations and data services at the IFB, said.\nLucy, 17, from Leeds told the BBC she was shocked by the quotes she received after passing her driving test in December.\n\"They were just outrageous,\" she said. \"Some of them were just silly - one was for \u00c2\u00a39,000.\"\nTo overcome the costs Lucy's mum took out a \u00c2\u00a32,800 policy on the car and added her daughter as a named driver.\nWhile her mum does drive the car, Lucy uses it for college during the week and to get to her weekend job.\nHer mum Andrea told the BBC she had never heard of fronting before, but believes she and her daughter share the car equally.\n\"We had no other option,\" she said. \"We did look at putting it in her name, we asked the question of the insurance company and this is what they came back with.\"\nLucy said she was aware of fronting. \"Obviously it's a concern, but once I've done my A-levels my mum will be driving the car to work and I will have it on weekends so she will be the main driver.\n\"At the moment there's not really anything I can do. It's either that or I don't drive.\"\nWhile Lucy would like her own policy, she added: \"Everyone's in the same position. Being a named driver is the only way anyone can afford to do this.\"\nInsurance for young drivers often outstrips the cost of a second-hand car, the usual vehicle for those who have just passed their test. These costs may be having an impact.\nThe numbers of driving tests being taken by young people has dropped in recent years.\nIn 2019-20, before the first lockdown of the pandemic, 520,505 tests were taken by 17 and 18-year-olds, according to the Driving Vehicle Standards Agency. But in 2022-23 that figure fell to 504,718.\nHowever, there is no data on what is behind the drop and whether it has anything to do with costs or is simply a hangover from the driving test backlog accumulated during and after Covid.\n'The car became an ornament'\nPaul from West Lothian told the BBC that when his 17-year-old daughter Danni passed her driving test, the firm she had her provisional insurance with refused to transfer the policy.\n\"The car became an ornament,\" he said.\nThe 59-year-old hunted around and took out a \u00c2\u00a33,600 policy in his name and added his daughter as a named driver with a black box.\nWithout the car she would have an eight-mile trip to college, which would otherwise take two bus journeys with \"times that are all over the place\", he said.\nNow Danni drives herself to college although the car is also driven by both parents. \"I'm sure we're not doing anything illegal,\" Paul said.\nHowever, his concern is that costs have become so prohibitive that people will start driving without insurance.\n\"Absolutely, that is a worry,\" he said. \"What I want to know is, why can't we have a system of insurance like they have in Australia, where the car is insured and not the person?\nIn every state in Australia compulsory third-party insurance is paid as part of vehicle registration, although this only covers injuries to other people and not damage to other vehicles. Other third-party policies and comprehensive policies are optional and can be added by the owner.\n'It's either no insurance or bike'\nIn Bicester, 19-year-old Stefan is also struggling with high costs.\nDespite a full-time job driving for Ocado, he can no longer afford to keep his own car because of the insurance premiums, having been quoted around \u00c2\u00a3700 a month or \u00c2\u00a38,000 a year.\n\"I drive eight hours on average every day at work,\" he said. \"They judge books by covers and think that just because you're young you must be a bad driver.\n\"It's either driving without insurance and risk ruining my future or going to work at 6am in the freezing cold with a bicy",

    "When Valdo Calocane was handed a hospital order for killing three people in Nottingham and attempting to kill others, it prompted a furious response from the victims' families.\nAs well as questioning the sentence passed down, they have raised concerns about interactions the killer had with health services and the police prior to the attacks, as well as how the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) handled the case.\nWhy was Calocane sentenced for manslaughter, and not murder?\nCalocane had originally been charged with three counts of murder and three of attempted murder.\nHowever, while in custody, it emerged he had been transferred to a \"secure hospital setting\" and assessed by three forensic psychiatrists.\nThey all agreed the 32-year-old had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attacks, which \"impaired his ability to exercise self-control\".\nThe CPS \"took the unusual step\" of asking a fourth expert to review those reports, and after they agreed with the findings, prosecutors concluded there was \"no realistic prospect of conviction for murder\".\nCalocane's plea of manslaughter on the basis on diminished responsibility was submitted on 28 November , and accepted by prosecutors on Tuesday.\nThe decision to accept surprised many who assumed he would face a murder trial.\nJames Coates, the son of school caretaker Ian Coates - who was stabbed to death on his way to work - said Calocane had \"made a mockery of the system\" and \"got away with murder\".\nFollowing sentencing, the CPS said: \"Diminished responsibility is only a partial defence to murder. It is for the defendant to prove that it applies.\n\"In this case, the evidence that Valdo Calocane's actions and self-control were significantly impaired by paranoid schizophrenia, a serious mental health condition, was compelling.\"\nWho was supposed to be looking after Calocane?\nNottingham Crown Court heard Calocane's mental illness began in 2019, and he had been detained under the Mental Health Act at a psychiatric unit in Nottingham four times since May 2020.\nOn each occasion, he was discharged - the final time in February 2022.\nHe was prescribed anti-psychotic medication but stopped taking it, which the prosecution said led to a further decline in his mental health.\nDr Sanjoy Kumar, the father of victim Grace O'Malley-Kumar, said: \"While we have never questioned this man's diagnosis, the lack of toxicology, contemporaneous mental health assessment, as well as missed opportunities to divert his lethal path will forever play on our minds and this requires further review.\"\nNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said it had \"robustly\" reviewed its interactions with Calocane.\nChief executive Ifti Majid said: \"If a patient no longer engages with our services and support and they do not meet criteria to be detained under the Mental Health Act, they are discharged back to the care of their GP and can be referred back into our services at any time.\"\nNHS England is planning a major investigation into the case.\nWhy was Calocane not arrested, despite a warrant being issued?\nIt has emerged officers from Nottinghamshire Police had failed to detain Calocane after an arrest warrant was issued in September 2022, when he failed to appear in court following an assault on an officer.\nOn Wednesday, Assistant Chief Constable Rob Griffin said: \"I have personally reviewed this matter and we should have done more to arrest him.\n\"However, because of the circumstance prevailing, at the time of the alleged assault, in my opinion it is highly unlikely that he would have received a custodial sentence.\n\"Of course, an arrest might have triggered a route back into mental health services, but as we have seen from his previous encounters with those services, it seems unlikely that he would have engaged in this process.\"\nThis led Emma Webber, mother of victim Barnaby Webber, to tell Mr Griffin he had \"blood on his hands\".\nIt has also been confirmed that while he was wanted for assault, Calocane was reported to police for attacking two workmates at a warehouse but was not arrested .\nHow much were the families consulted?\nMrs Webber has also criticised the CPS over what she sees as a lack of communication.\nShe said: \"The CPS did not consult us as has been reported - instead we have been rushed, hastened and railroaded.\"\nMrs Webber said the first meeting with them was on 24 November.\n\"We were presented with a fait accompli that the decision had been made to accept manslaughter charges,\" she said.\n\"At no point during the previous five and a half months were we given any indication that this could conclude in anything other than murder.\"\nA CPS spokesperson said: \"The CPS offered to meet with the families following our decision to charge. This offer was open-ended, whenever the families were ready to do so.\n\"We did meet with the families of Grace and Barnaby when they took up that offer following receipt of the first three psychiatric reports.\n\"The CPS again met with them both in early Dec",
    "The return of Stormont should help efforts to attract investors to Northern Ireland, US trade envoy Joe Kennedy III has said.\nMr Kennedy has been visiting Northern Ireland this week.\nHe said that he had already been able to bring potential investors to NI but having ministers in place would be important.\nHe said firms contemplating big commitments \"want to talk to the person running government\".\n\"We were able to bring over 50 business and civil society leaders to Northern Ireland back in October because people believe in the people of Northern Ireland.\n\"But, certainly, when you're talking to major businesses that are being courted for hundreds of millions of dollars of investments they want to be able to sit down and talk to the chief executive, they want to talk to the ministers.\"\n'Long, detailed process'\nPart of the government's deal with the DUP contains a commitment to enter into talks with the US on the possibility of introducing pre-clearance procedures for passengers travelling from Belfast International Airport to the US.\nThere are currently no regularly scheduled transatlantic flights from Belfast - Norwegian ended its services in 2018.\nHowever, Dublin Airport serves more than a dozen US cities, helped by its preclearance facility.\nIt allows passengers to undertake all US immigration, customs and agriculture inspections at Dublin Airport prior to departure and so avoid immigration queues on arrival.\nMr Kennedy said business leaders in Northern Ireland want to improve connections to the US and he would engage with US agencies.\nBut he cautioned that getting US agreement for preclearance was \"a long, detailed process that takes years and is expensive\".\nHe said airlines would also have to make their own commercial decisions.\nTax breaks aren't 'the holy grail'\nThe DUP deal also includes a commitment to revive efforts to devolve corporation tax to Northern Ireland.\nThere has previously been cross-party support for a policy of cutting corporation tax as a tool for attracting international investment.\nMr Kennedy said where there was \"broad-based political support for something my job here is to try to support that process\".\nHowever, he suggested that investors were not going to be primarily attracted by tax breaks.\nHe gave the example of the economic and entrepreneurial strength of his home state of Massachusetts which is not one of the US's lowest tax states.\n\"There's reasons to want to pursue it.

    "A sub-postmaster claims a new version of the Horizon system has left him more than \u00c2\u00a32,900 in debt.\nFor years, hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly accused of stealing money due to incorrect data being provided by the computer system.\nSheffield sub-postmaster Nasar Raoof said the software had since been updated but was still causing problems.\nA Post Office spokesperson said the new Horizon version was \"robust\" and that training had been offered to Mr Raoof.\nThe 37-year-old, who runs Banner Cross Post Office in Ecclesall Road, said issues with Horizon started about a year after he took on the business in 2021.\nMr Raoof said he began to notice small losses on his accounts but \"nothing major\" initially.\nHowever, he said in July 2022, nearly \u00c2\u00a35,000 \"completely vanished off the system\".\nThe Horizon system Mr Raoof works with was developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu.\nIt was introduced by the Post Office in 1999 but sub-postmasters complained about bugs in the system after it falsely reported shortfalls - often for many thousands of pounds.\nThe faulty system led to more than 900 sub-postmasters being wrongly prosecuted for stealing money because of incorrect information provided by Horizon.\nMr Raoof said his first big shortfall was investigated by the Post Office for nearly six months until the firm agreed to write off the debt.\n\"That's after months of ringing and telling them that I'm losing my sanity, I'm losing the will to live,\" Mr Raoof said.\n\"The blame is put on me, it's 'you can't balance correctly, you need a trainer, you need intervention'.\"\nMr Raoof said he graduated with a 2.1 in IT and business studies and had to undergo an assessment and interview before he was given permission to run the branch.\nA Post Office spokesperson said there had been several versions of Horizon since its introduction in 1999 and that the current version, introduced from 2017, was found to be \"robust\".\nThe spokesperson added the firm was intending to replace Horizon with a new cloud-based system in the future.\nMr Raoof said despite changes made to Horizon, it was still \"flawed\", adding: \"How can the trust be there?\n\"I have asked for a letter to say the system is fool proof and they have not been able to give that to me.\"\nDetermined to prove the incorrect balances were not his fault, Mr Raoof said he installed CCTV with the permission from his three part-time members of staff.\nDespite this, the numbers on his computer screen still did not add up and, to date, he has accrued an imbalance of more than \u00c2\u00a32,900.\nMr Raoof said his staff were now dreading the end of the day, when the branch books were being balanced.\n\"All day we'd be perked up, joking around, laughing around with customers, but then that last hour would become the most miserable hour,\" he said.\n\"That is just not a business that I want to be part of.\"\n'I regret taking it on'\nA Post Office spokesperson said they were \"sorry\" to hear about Mr Raoof's experience and said they had visited him twice in October and December.\n\"As part of these visits, we made suggestions around how he might improve the operational processes in the branch and also offered to arrange a visit from one of our field trainers to refresh both himself and his colleagues on these processes,\" the spokesperson said.\nThey said the Post Office would continue to engage with Mr Raoof to understand what support he may need to \"resolve existing discrepancies and how he might avoid future discrepancies occurring\".\nMr Raoof said he had been aware of some issues with the Horizon system before taking on the branch but had not known the true extent.\n\"If I had known this, I would never have gone into running a post office,\" he said.\n\"I regret taking it on but I love the community. I will continue for the human aspect but if it was down to the post office, I would've packed it in a long time ago.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

He said a rate reduction in March, as some investors had been betting, was unlikely.\nSome analysts said the strong pay gains reported on Friday - with average hourly earnings up 4.5% compared with January 2023 - should worry those hoping to see inflation continue to fall quickly.\n\"Wages growing at this rate, in a labour market this tight, is a problem for the Fed,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.\nOthers warned that a fall in overall hours worked each week would undercut pay gains and complicated the picture.\nWith the US presidential election due in November, the monthly report has become a political flashpoint.\nWhile surveys show consumer sentiment has improved in recent months, the mood remains significantly more downbeat than before the pandemic.\nAnalysts said that while wage gains have largely caught up recent price rises, people are still coming to terms with higher costs.\n\"You remember when you were paying $1 for something and now you're paying $1.17,\" said professor Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll. \"Adjusting to the new normal for prices - that takes a long time.\"",
    "The man was thought to be a witness, not a suspect.\nBut when he appeared this week at the public inquiry into South Africa's deadliest building fire, he announced he had started it.\nSthembiso Lawrence Mdlalose, 30, said he had started the fire in the Usindiso building last August unintentionally.\nHe described himself as working for a violent drug dealer who demanded rent from residents.\nHe said the fire began after he used fuel to set light to the body of a man he had strangled while high on drugs, in a ground-floor room used to beat people targeted by the dealer.\nPolice arrested him at the inquiry. While in custody, he made a further confession.\nHe appeared in court on Thursday charged with 76 murders, 86 attempted murders, and a charge of arson. The authorities have not explained why he is facing 76 charges of murder, when the public inquiry has said 77 people died in the fire.\nProsecutors allege the murders were pre-meditated.\nJohannesburg, known as the city of gold, is Africa's wealthiest city.\nThe fire has highlighted the profound housing crisis here.\nMany people live in appalling conditions, without water or electricity, in deeply unsafe buildings.\nThe plight of the fire's survivors demonstrates the crisis still further.\nMore than 500 people were left homeless by the fire. The residents are some of the poorest people in South African society.\nIn the immediate aftermath, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the scene and declared \"our hearts go out to every person affected by this event\".\nHe said the disaster called on everyone, from the government down, to help restore the wellbeing of those affected and \"offer all material help residents may need\".\nBut, five months on, many survivors are suffering.\nWe visited 39 families who have been placed by the authorities in a newly built camp of metal shacks, which have no water or power, and which flood when it rains.\nSthembiso Ndebele lives in one of the shacks with her three children, including her disabled 10-year-old son, who she said is not coping with the conditions.\nShe asked President Ramaphosa to \"please give us housing not these shacks - these shacks are too dangerous for us\".\nHundreds of people living in the shacks have access to only two communal taps, a few chemical toilets which residents say are deeply unhygienic, and no showers or bathing facilities.\nWe saw men cooking on open fires, with elderly women shovelling sand around the bottom of their shacks to stop water getting in.\nThe Denver area of the city where the shacks have been placed is dangerous, and one girl has been raped, the residents said.\nAt first, multiple security guards were provided to keep watch, but these were withdrawn, leaving a single guard on a daytime shift by the time we visited.\nAndy Chinnah, a human rights activist who is helping the residents, said: \"We want dignity and this is not dignity\".\nWhen I challenged Johannesburg's Mayor, Kabelo Gwamanda, on the camp's conditions, he said there was not \"sufficient budget for us to be responding efficiently or in the manner in which we want to\", especially when \"unplanned\" emergencies occur.\nHe said that, in the past, the city had decent alternative accommodation, but those properties \"got hijacked\".\nThis was a reference to the city's so-called \"hijacked buildings\".\nMatthew Wilhelm-Solomon, author of The Blinded City, says the term emerged in the early 2000s and referred to criminal gangs taking over some properties.\nHe says it was subsequently applied by the media and politicians to an array of buildings, even though many did not have gangs taking over and illegally renting them.\nWilhelm-Solomon says that what was essentially a crisis about affordable inner city rental properties began to be viewed \"through the lens of criminality\", which ended up criminalising people who were just looking for accommodation.\nMany buildings in the city have been abandoned or neglected by owners and left without basic services or safety measures.\nThe law gives people evicted from such buildings the right to emergency temporary accommodation. But the profound lack of affordable housing means this is rarely offered.\nThe camp of metal shacks is the authorities' current offer of such temporary accommodation, but those living there wonder how long \"temporary\" will turn out to be.\nAn estimated 15,000 people are believed to be homeless in Johannesburg.\nThe mayor says there are now 188 \"bad buildings\" under investigation, with 134 of them in the inner city, and that the city authorities are pursuing multiple court cases to evict people, approaching them as places from which they need to be rescued.\nCourtrooms are a battle ground in the struggle for decent housing.\nAfter the Usindiso building fire, there were 248 people at the scene who agreed to be relocated to various shelters, according to court documents, with some foreign nationals refusing to be relocated to shelters due to fear of deportation.\nThirty-two foreign nationals were arrested ",
    "Search for \"AI investing\" online, and you'll be flooded with endless offers to let artificial intelligence manage your money.\nI recently spent half an hour finding out what so-called AI \"trading bots\" could apparently do with my investments.\nMany prominently suggest that they can give me lucrative returns. Yet as every reputable financial firm warns - your capital may be at risk.\nOr putting it more simply - you could lose your money - whether it is a human or a computer that is making stock market decisions on your behalf.\nYet such has been the hype about the ability of AI over the past few years, that almost one in three investors would be happy to let a trading bot make all the decisions for them, according to one 2023 survey in the US.\nJohn Allan says investors should be more cautious about using AI. He is head of innovation and operations for the UK's Investment Association, the trade body for UK investment managers.\n\"Investment is something that's very serious, it affects people and their long-term life objectives,\" he says. \"So being swayed by the latest craze might not be sensible.\n\"I think at the very least, we need to wait until AI has proved itself over the very long term, before we can judge its effectiveness. And in the meantime, there will be a significant role for human investment professionals still to play.\"\nGiven that AI-powered trading bots may end up putting some highly-trained but expensive human investment managers out of work you might expect Mr Allan to say this. But such AI trading is indeed new, and it does have issues and uncertainties.\nFirstly, AI is not a crystal ball, it cannot see into the future any more than a human can. And if you look back over the past 25 years, there have been unforeseen events that have tripped up the stock markets, such as 9/11, the 2007-2008 credit crisis, and the coronavirus pandemic.\nSecondly, AI systems are only as good as the initial data and software that is used to create them by human computer programmers. To explain this issue we need a little history lesson.\nInvestment banks have actually been using basic or \"weak AI\" to guide their market choices since the early 1980s. That basic AI could study financial data, learn from it, and make autonomous decisions that - hopefully - got ever more accurate. These weak AI systems did not predict 9/11, or even the credit crisis.\nFast-forward to today, and when we talk about AI we often mean something called \"generative AI\". This is far more powerful AI, which can create something new and then learn from that.\nWhen applied to investment, generative AI can absorb masses of data and makes its own decisions. But it can also work out better ways to study the data and develop its own computer code.\nYet if this AI was originally fed bad data by the human programmers, then its decisions may simply get worse and worse the more code it creates.\nRead additional stories on artificial intelligence\nElise Gourier, an associate professor in finance at the ESSEC Business School in Paris, is an expert in the study of AI going wrong. She cites Amazon's recruitment efforts in 2018 as a prime example.\n\"Amazon was one of the first companies to get caught out,\" she says. \"What happened was that they developed this AI tool to recruit people.\n\"So, they're getting thousands of CVs, and they thought we're just going to automate the whole process. And basically, the AI tool was reading the CVs for them and telling them who to hire.\n\"The problem was that the AI tool was trained on its employees, and its employees are mainly men, and so, as a result of that, basically what the algorithm was doing was filtering out all the women.\"\nAmazon had to scrap the AI-powered recruitment.\nGenerative AI can also simply just go wrong, and produce incorrect information, something termed a \"hallucination\", says Prof Sandra Wachter, a senior research fellow in AI at Oxford University.\n\"Generative AI is prone to bias and inaccuracies, it can spit out wrong information or completely fabricate facts. Without vigorous oversights it is hard to spot these flaws and hallucinations.\"\nProf Sandra Wachter also warns that automated AI systems can be at risk of data leakage or something called \"model inversion attacks\". The latter - in simple terms - is when hackers ask the AI a series of specific questions in the hope that it reveals its underling coding and data.\nThere is also the chance that AI will become less of a genius investment advice engine, and more like the stock pickers you used to find in the Sunday newspapers. They would always recommend some minor share to buy first thing on Monday morning, and miraculously the shares would always jump in value first thing that day.\nThis, of course, had nothing to do tens of thousands of readers all rushing to buy the share in question.\nSo despite all these risks, why are a sizeable number of investors seemingly keen to let AI make decisions for them?

    "US politicians have called for new laws to criminalise the creation of deepfake images, after explicit faked photos of Taylor Swift were viewed millions of times online.\nThe images were posted on social media sites, including X and Telegram.\nUS Representative Joe Morelle called the spread of the pictures \"appalling\".\nIn a statement, X said it was \"actively removing\" the images and taking \"appropriate actions\" against the accounts involved in spreading them.\nIt added: \"We're closely monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are immediately addressed, and the content is removed.\"\nWhile many of the images appear to have been removed at the time of publication, one photo of Swift was viewed a reported 47 million times before being taken down.\nThe name \"Taylor Swift\" is no longer searchable on X, alongside terms such as \"Taylor Swift AI\" and \"Taylor AI\".\nDeepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) to make a video of someone by manipulating their face or body. A study in 2023 found that there has been a 550% rise in the creation of doctored images since 2019, fuelled by the emergence of AI.\nThere are currently no federal laws against the sharing or creation of deepfake images, though there have been moves at state level to tackle the issue.\nIn the UK, the sharing of deepfake pornography became illegal as part of its Online Safety Act in 2023.\nDemocratic Rep Morelle, who last year unveiled the proposed Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act - which would have made it illegal to share deepfake pornography without consent - called for urgent action on the issue.\nHe said the images and videos \"can cause irrevocable emotional, financial, and reputational harm - and unfortunately, women are disproportionately impacted\".\nPornography consists of the overwhelming majority of the deepfakes posted online, with women making up 99% of those targeted in such content, according to the State of Deepfakes report published last year.\n\"What's happened to Taylor Swift is nothing new,\" Democratic Rep Yvette D Clarke posted on X. She noted that women had been targeted by the technology \"for years\", adding that with \"advancements in AI, creating deepfakes is easier & cheaper\".\nRepublican Congressman Tom Kean Jr agreed, saying that it is \"clear that AI technology is advancing faster than the necessary guardrails\".\n\"Whether the victim is Taylor Swift or any young person across our country, we need to establish safeguards to combat this alarming trend,\" he added.\nSwift has not spoken publicly about the images, but the Daily Mail reported that her team is \"considering legal action\" against the site which published the AI-generated images.\nWorries about AI-generated content have increased as billions of people vote in elections this year across the globe.\nThis week, a fake robocall claiming to be from US President Joe Biden sparked an investigation. It is thought to have been made by AI.",
    "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) didn't just set one threshold to measure the success or failure of any deal with the government, they set seven.\nNow the full details of the 76 page deal have been laid bare, the party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has insisted all seven tests have been met\nOn the surface it appears the party has ticked all seven boxes.\nBut some of those boxes are open to interpretation and may be defined differently by the party's opponents.\nOn the first test  - fulfilling article 6 of the Article of Union - the DUP argues it has restored unfettered trade with the rest of the UK through legislation.\nWhen it comes to the second test of avoiding any diversion of trade, the DUP says the removal of internal barriers now takes away the risk of divergence.\nTests number three and number five involved removing the Irish Sea border.\nThe DUP argues that frontier has now gone because the deal secures the free flow of goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.\nIn truth there will still be some checks and paperwork but they will be greatly reduced and are unlikely to affect internal trade.\nStormont brake\nAnother key test involved giving people in Northern Ireland a say in making the laws under which they are governed.\nThe DUPs say a mechanism already agreed in Windsor Framework known as the Stormont brake will come in to play ensuring local politicians can veto any new EU rules.\nBut ultimately it will be up to the government in London to deploy that veto.\nTo ensure there's no new regulatory border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK - test number six -  the deal commits the government to screen new laws to ensure they don't impact on Northern Ireland's place in the UK.\nThe final test calls for a constitutional guarantee that Northern Ireland's place within the UK will be preserved. This again falls under the legislation agreed in the deal.\nThough the DUP will argue all seven tests have been met, expect the party's political opponents to try and expose where the deal falls short.",

    "Niven Phoenix was 21 years old and training to be pilot when he got the call telling him to go home.\nBy the time he was in the car, the radio was reporting the worst.\nA Chinook helicopter had crashed in the Mull of Kintryre in Scotland after leaving Northern Ireland. There had been no survivors.\nIt was 2 June 1994. His father Det Supt Ian Phoenix and 28 other people had lost their lives.\n\"It just sort of floored me and I had to stop the car,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"My friend, who was with me, had to take over and drive me home.\"\nIt was the worst peacetime accident in the history of the RAF. On board were leading security personnel from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), MI5 and the Army.\nThey had been travelling to a security conference in Inverness, just two months before the 1994 IRA ceasefire.\nNow the crash - the exact cause of which remans unknown - and the controversial investigations that came in its aftermath are the subject of a new two-part BBC Northern Ireland documentary, Chinook: Zulu Delta 576.\nThe documentary looks at the ongoing impact of what happened that day, from the devastation caused to family members to the inquiry that blamed the pilots, sparking a two-decade campaign to successfully clear their names .\nNiven, who contributed to the documentary, said his father joined the RUC after a stint in the Army, rising through the ranks to become a detective superintendent in Special Branch.\nHis father could be strict, said Niven, but that was a reflection of the high-pressure environment of working as a senior police officer in the midst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\"We did have a good relationship and we did love each other,\" he said.\nHe remembers the day of the accident vividly - the phone call, in which he was told to go home; asking officers what was going on but getting no further information; the radio report and his friend driving him the rest of the way.\nHe remembers the aftermath too, the comfort found in people walking up the hill to his family's house that night.\n\"People were very caring, they felt it personally. There was a heavy attachment to the police and military when you're growing up in Northern Ireland, they are often seen as the protectors,\" he said.\nSpeaking about how the family dealt with the passing of his father, Niven said it was a \"long process\".\n\"It doesn't go away, grief stays with you and your life grows around it. You just have to get on with it and be grateful for the things you did have,\" he said.\n\"We were very grateful for the time we had with my father, his funeral was probably one of the proudest days of my life, when I saw all the people - and I managed to speak at his funeral as well.\"\nOne thing that struck him even then, he said, was that there were \"worse ways\" for a policeman to die in Northern Ireland at that time than in an accident.\nFrom the beginning, he said, his family had no anger towards the crew, believing that \"accidents happen\".\nNiven was already on the path to becoming a pilot when his father died but believes the crash was a \"formative experience\" for his career going forward in relation to safety.\n\"My time in the military was coloured by how I viewed the hierarchy in that, for want of a better phrase, I couldn't trust them,\" he said.\nHe often turned down operations which he felt were not planned out or safe and that, because superiors were aware of his father's death, he was never questioned about it.\nTrevor Birney, the director of the new documentary, was a young journalist working for Downtown Radio when the crash happened.\n\"As a reporter there's always stories that resonate with you and stick with you,\" he said.\n\"There was the loss of life, the high calibre of personnel on board and then the were the years of injustice.\"\nHe compared the controversy to the ongoing the Post Office IT scandal.\nThe RAF was heavily criticised for its board of inquiry's finding that gross negligence on the part of the two pilots was to blame.\nThe two men, Flt Lt Jonathan Tapper and Flt Lt Richard Cook, were eventually exonerated of any blame after a two-decade long campaign led by their families.\n\"Here in Northern Ireland we are used to families alleging collusion or looking for the truth,\" said Mr Birney.\n\"This is the very establishment itself, 10 RUC men, six from MI5, four crew and nine from the British Army - if the RAF refused to give them the truth what chances does anyone else have?\"\nHe added that speaking to the families was a vital part of the story.\n\"Sometimes we don't get the chance to pause, its not just a statistic or a name on a plaque on a wall, this had real impact and devastation to the Phoenixs and those others involved\nChinook: Zulu Delta 576 will be broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland at 22:40 GMT on 29 January and BBC Scotland at 22:00 on 30 January.

    "Labour and the Conservatives have been making claims about what is happening to taxation.\nAt the start of what is widely expected to be an election year, they have been talking about the impact of tax changes on \"average\" workers and families.\nWe have been looking at some of their claims.\n\u00c2\u00a31,200 extra tax for an average family?\nLaunching a new campaign poster on Friday 5 January, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"Working people are worse off under the Tories - \u00c2\u00a31,200 for an average family extra tax this year because of choices by Rishi Sunak and this Conservative government.\"\nThat is not correct. Labour have confirmed that she \"misspoke\".\nShe was talking about tax because National Insurance came down by 2p in the pound from 6 January 2024.\nBut the level of income at which people start paying tax has been frozen - since July 2022 for National Insurance and since April 2021 for income tax.\nWhere does the \u00c2\u00a31,200 come from?\nLabour confirmed that the \u00c2\u00a31,200 figure came from research by the Resolution Foundation , focusing on living standards.\nThe independent think tank said in November 2023 that taxes would rise \u00c2\u00a31,200 per household by 2028-29 - not this year.\nThis is based on the November predictions by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes forecasts for the government:\nOf course, not every household will pay \u00c2\u00a31,200. Richer households will pay significantly more - poorer households much less.\nSo what is happening this year?\nFor an employee on average full-time earnings of about \u00c2\u00a335,000, the two factors roughly cancel each other out this year, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).\nThat will not be the case for all workers. Some of those on lower incomes will lose out - some higher earners will gain more than they lose. The IFS says that it is a tax rise overall this year.\nIt is in later years that the increases in taxes outweigh the National Insurance cut for the average earner, as more people start paying tax and start paying higher rates of tax.\nPaying \u00c2\u00a310 and getting back \u00c2\u00a32?\nOn Friday 26 January, Rachel Reeves tweeted : \"Under Rishi Sunak's Raw Deal, for every extra \u00c2\u00a310 you pay in tax, you only get \u00c2\u00a32 back.\"\nThat was also the message on the poster from earlier in the month, but again it refers to forecasts for 2028-29 and not the current situation.\nIt's another calculation based on the OBR forecasts from November .\nAs mentioned before, the tax increases are predicted to raise an extra \u00c2\u00a344.6bn in 2028-29 while the cut in National Insurance costs the government \u00c2\u00a310bn that year.\nIt means that the tax cut is worth just under a quarter of the increase, which Labour has rounded down to paying an extra \u00c2\u00a310 and getting \u00c2\u00a32 back.\nClearly that's not true for every taxpayer - it's an average. The actual impact will depend on income levels.\nWill the average earner save \u00c2\u00a3450?\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke about tax cuts in an interview on Friday 5 January.

    "A singer with thyroid cancer said the prospect of losing her voice was \"more terrifying\" than the diagnosis itself.\nFlorence Pardoe, 35, from Eastville, in Bristol, was diagnosed with a papillary carcinoma in January 2023.\nShe made the decision to delay removal surgery until after recording her album, afraid that complications might halt her singing career forever.\n\"The thing that actually scared me the most was how having this surgery might affect my voice,\" she said.\nThyroid cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the thyroid - a small gland at the base of the neck that produces hormones.\n\"The whole time I had cancer I never considered myself to be someone with cancer, I just had a few cancerous cells on my thyroid,\" she told BBC Radio Bristol's John Darvall .\nBut doctors revealed to Ms Pardoe that they would need take out her thyroid out completely.\n\"Whilst the word in itself was scary... there was a chance that it could impact my voice permanently, that I might not get the range or the power back, so that was terrifying,\" she said.\n\"I had a run of three gigs not long before my surgery and it was really emotional, because a big part of me was thinking 'is this going to be the last time I can sing like this?'\"\nMs Pardoe said she first began noticing issues with her thyroid around 12 years ago but they went undiagnosed by NHS doctors, who told her she was within the 'normal range'.\nShe was eventually diagnosed by a specialist with hypothyroidism , a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones.\nMs Pardoe said she would encourage others living with thyroid symptoms \"to be their own advocates with their doctors.\"\n'Good to be back'\nDoctors gave her medication to regulate the imbalance, but a subsequent check up revealed the cancerous lump.\nIn June last year, Ms Pardoe underwent a successful surgery, with doctors assuring her there was no more cancer in her body.\nShe has since been receiving speech and language therapy at St Michael's Hospital to \"retrain\" her singing voice.\n\"A lot of the work we've been doing is just trying to help me get out of my own head, to relax back into what my body already knows how to do,\" Ms Pardoe said.\n\"It's not as easy as it once was, but it's so good to be back.

    "South African Airways - once a giant of African aviation - is back in the intercontinental market, but there are still doubts about its financial viability.\nIt had disappeared from our skies altogether in September 2020, having fallen victim not just to Covid but also another disease that has plagued some other state-run carriers - corruption and mismanagement.\nIt may be on the verge of a sale that would see a private consortium take a majority share in the business.\nHowever, its handling of finances has recently come in for severe criticism by the country's public spending watchdog.\nIn a scathing report, Auditor-General Tsakani Maluleke said that the financial statements SAA had drawn up dating from the 2018-19 financial year lacked credibility. The airline recorded losses in the four years from 2018 of a staggering $1.2bn (\u00c2\u00a31bn).\nBut interim chief executive officer (CEO) John Lamola said this did not reflect the current position of the airline, which is under new management.\nHe said the situation had improved in the most recent financial year, with the airline now \"running on financial resources generated from its own operations\".\nTowards the end of last year, in a sign that SAA wants to be a major player again, it reopened its routes from Cape Town and Johannesburg to S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, Brazil. And now it is selling tickets for flights to Perth, Australia.\nThese are the airline's first long-haul destinations in three years. It did return in September 2021, making a surprise profit serving a limited number of African destinations after coming out of voluntary business rescue.\nThis was a process which saw the airline placed under the temporary supervision of experts who were asked to return the company to financial health. They pared back the fleet from 44 aircraft to six and focused on the African market.\nNow it is aiming further afield.\n\"The choice of S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo was as a result of a very meticulous economic and market research analysis,\" Mr Lamola told the BBC.\nHe added that the intercontinental flights hoped to enhance trade and tourism ties between the two countries as members of Brics - an expanding group of emerging economies originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.\nPrior to the Covid pandemic, SAA operated five other intercontinental routes from Johannesburg to destinations including New York and Hong Kong.\nThat route encapsulates the prestige that used to accompany the airline. Once the largest in Africa, SAA faced profound challenges in the last decade.\n\"South African Airways notoriously has gone through a process in South Africa called 'state capture ', where there are well-recorded incidents of corruption that characterised the life of the airline,\" said Mr Lamola, adding that investigations were ongoing.\nAn official inquiry into state capture released at the beginning of 2022 showed that the airline had been wracked by corruption between 2012 and 2017.\nAs a result of the mismanagement, SAA was forced to rely entirely on government financial assistance over a 10-year period to stay afloat, a situation made worse by Covid.\n\"In that period\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the government had to put in some 40bn rand ($2.2bn) into SAA,\" said Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan.\nIt had been run at a loss since 2011.\nThe national carrier was placed under voluntary business rescue in 2019 to protect it from bankruptcy.\nSAA sell-off plan\nIt was then forced to suspend all operations in September 2020, as it struggled to raise a bailout of over $540m.\nAs part of a programme to rescue the airline, the government announced plans, in June 2021, to sell a 51% stake in SAA to a group known as the Takatso Consortium.\nUnder the scheme, the government's department of public enterprises retains the remaining 49% stake, securing a long-term national strategic interest in the airline.\nLast July, it was approved by the Competition Tribunal of South Africa provided that certain conditions were met.\nOne of the requirements was a moratorium on staff cuts that guarantees job security for SAA employees during the transitional phase.\nBut it has hit problems, with trade unions alleging that proper procedures were not followed. A parliamentary committee plans to subpoena Mr Gordhan to investigate this further.\nTakatso, with its huge cash injection, had been seen as a lifeline for SAA, but the airline says it will carry on with its expansion plans in the meantime.\nSAA's new management hopes to shift the business from its dependence on state support to a financially self-sustaining one, by only maintaining a fleet it can afford and pulling out of the low-cost market.\n\"This airline must be able to survive on operational efficiencies,\" said Mr Lamola.\nThese include choosing routes for commercial rather than political reasons, building a fleet with appropriate long-haul aircraft and matching expansion with the pace of the post-Covid recovery in the global aviation industry.\nAviation analyst and founder of online publication Airspa",
    "Greta Thunberg is one of the world's best-known climate change campaigners.\nThe 21-year-old from Sweden is due to go on trial at a magistrates court in London on 1 February, following her arrest at an environmental protest in October 2023.\nWho is Greta Thunberg and how did she become a climate activist?\nMs Thunberg was born in the Swedish capital Stockholm in 2003. Her mother Malena Ernman is an opera singer, and her father Svante Thunberg is an actor.\nShe first learned about climate change when she was eight.\nWhen she was 11 or 12, she started suffering from depression, according to her father, Svante.\n\"She stopped talking... she stopped going to school,\" he said.\nAround the same time she was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism.\nIn summer 2018, aged 15, Ms Thunberg held the first \"School Strike for Climate\" outside the Swedish parliament.\nThe protest was widely covered, and hundreds of thousands of young people across the world joined her Fridays For Future strikes .\nMr Thunberg says his daughter became \"much happier\" after she started campaigning.\nShe has described her autism diagnosis as a \"superpower\" which helped motivate her protests.\n\"Being different is a gift,\" she told the BBC . \"If I would've been like everyone else, I wouldn't have started this school strike.\"\nBetween 2019 and 2020, she took a year out of school to concentrate on activism, and became famous for her impassioned speeches to world leaders.\nShe left school in summer 2023, and ended her school climate strikes .\nWhat have been her most famous speeches?\nIn April 2019, aged 16, Ms Thunberg told members of the European Parliament : \"Our house is falling apart and our leaders need to start acting accordingly, because at the moment they are not.\"\nFive months later, she sailed by yacht across the Atlantic to address a UN climate action summit in New York .\n\"I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\" she told delegates. \"Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\"\nSpeaking at a youth protest in Glasgow in 2021, after the city hosted the COP26 climate change summit, she said: \"[World leaders have held] 26 COPs. They have had decades of blah, blah, blah - and where has that got us?\"\nWhy is she on trial in the UK?\nOn 17 October, Ms Thunberg was arrested along with four other people at a demonstration near a hotel in central London where an energy conference was taking place.\nShe is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 1 February, accused of a public order offence , which she denies.\nIn 2023, she was twice arrested at the port of Malmo in Sweden while blocking a road used for transporting oil.\nIn July of that year, a court fined her 2,500 krona ($240; \u00c2\u00a3187) and in October, she was fined 2,250 krona ($206; \u00c2\u00a3168) .\nWhat awards has Greta Thunberg won?\nMs Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year between 2019 and 2023.\nIn 2019, she became the youngest-ever Time Person of the Year .\nAlso in 2019, she won the Right Livelihood Award (known as the Alternative Nobel Prize) and Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award, and was listed by Forbes as one of the world's 100 most powerful women.\nIn 2022, she brought out The Climate Book, which contains essays from 100 scientists, writers and activists about how to combat the climate crisis.\nWhat have Greta Thunberg's critics said about her?\nAt the start of 2023, controversial media personality Andrew Tate baited Ms Thunberg on X, formerly Twitter, by listing his 33 cars and offering to send her details of their \"enormous emissions\" .\nShe responded with a sarcastic tweet which was liked by several million people and shared widely.\nShortly afterwards, broadcaster Julia Hartley-Brewer called her \"a half-educated, autistic, doom-mongering eco-cultist,\" in a tweet that she subsequently deleted.\nShe was also mocked on Twitter by former US President Donald Trump when she won the Time magazine award. He said: \"Greta must work on her Anger Management problem... Chill Greta, Chill!\" .\nRussian President Vladimir Putin described her as a \"kind, but poorly informed, teenager\".\nWhat has Greta Thunberg's campaigning achieved?\nAlthough Ms Thunberg has not devised any specific environmental strategies, she is credited with raising public awareness of climate change across the world, especially amongst young people.\nMany commentators call this \"the Greta effect\".\nBroadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough told her : \"You have aroused the world. I'm very grateful to you.\"",

He had walked down to the cafe after 15-20 minutes in the interview,\" she said.\n\"He was white as a sheet. You could see something had gone badly wrong. It was as if it was all closing in on him.\n\"He was saying: 'They are blaming me for Emma'.

That is the only words I can describe.\"\nMr Goddard put to the witness that Ms Caldwell had been a \"topic of conversation\" during the time they knew each other.\n\"At the beginning, did he claim to you where he was at the time Emma went missing?\" he said.\nThe woman replied: \"He said he was at home (with a child he knew) looking after her.\"\nAsked if his \"story\" had later changed, she said Mr Packer commented that he was \"up at work in Aberdeen or something\".\nMr Packer's lawyer, Ronnie Renucci KC, later asked the witness about how affected he appeared to be after the interview.\nHe said: \"In effect, you understood he was saying that they were blaming him for Emma Caldwell's murder. If someone is blaming you for that, it is not something that you would take well?\"\nShe replied: \"No.\"\nEarlier in her evidence, the woman accused Mr Packer of choking her while she lay in bed after an argument.\nShe said: \"I just closed my eyes. I could not move. What else could I do?\n\"I just froze and waited for it to be over. He had grabbed the windpipe part with two hands and squeezed really, really hard.\"\nShe described Mr Packer's face as being \"totally blank\" while he did this, but then it was as if \"a light switched on\" and he stopped and walked out of the room.\nHe was said to have offered no reason as to why he had done it.\nThe trial, before judge Lord Beckett, continues.",

    "Nicola Sturgeon has denied that some of her decisions during the Covid pandemic were motivated by furthering the cause of Scottish independence.\nThe former first minister also rejected claims she presided over a culture of secrecy despite admitting she deleted all her WhatsApps during the pandemic.\nBut she said all \"relevant\" information had been handed to the UK Covid Inquiry.\nMs Sturgeon was speaking as she gave evidence to the inquiry in Edinburgh.\nMs Sturgeon was asked by Channel 4 News in August 2021 whether she could \"guarantee to the bereaved families that you will disclose emails, WhatsApps, private emails if you've been using them. Whatever. That nothing will be off limits in this inquiry?'\nThe question related to the Scottish Covid Inquiry, which is being held separately to the UK-wide one.\nShe had replied at the time: \"If you understand statutory public inquiries you would know that even if I wasn't prepared to give that assurance, which for the avoidance of doubt I am, then I wouldn't have the ability. This will be a judge-led statutory inquiry.\"\nBut the UK inquiry has been told by Jamie Dawson KC that Ms Sturgeon appeared to have retained no informal messages in connection with her management of the pandemic.\nIt has also been shown exchanges of messages between senior Scottish government officials in which they were reminded that the conversations would be subject to Freedom of Information (FOI) laws and were urged to delete the messages.\nOpposition parties and survivors groups have accused the government of an \"industrial-scale\" deletion policy in an attempt to avoid scrutiny.\nHowever, some Scottish government figures - including Ms Sturgeon's former chief of staff Liz Lloyd and current First Minister Humza Yousaf - have submitted text conversations with Ms Sturgeon to the inquiry.\nGiving evidence to the inquiry on Wednesday morning, Ms Sturgeon - who stepped down as first minister and SNP leader in March of last year - said she exchanged WhatsApps with no more than a \"handful\" of people, and was not a member of any groups.\nShe said her use of the app was \"extremely limited\" and did not relate to \"substantive\" government business.\nMs Sturgeon, who became tearful at points during her evidence, said she deleted these informal messages in line with official advice, and \"salient\" points were all recorded on the corporate record.\nShe denied that deleting informal messages meant the Scottish or UK inquiries would be deprived of relevant material about how decisions were made during the pandemic.\nThe ex-SNP leader added: \"There would be nothing in those communications that was not available to either the inquiry or the public, through the record of the Scottish government or indeed in the very detailed public statements that were being made every day.\"\nThe former first minister said she had been trying to answer the \"substance\" of the Channel 4 question but said the \"literal terms\" of her answer may not have matched the question, which referred to the then first minister handing over \"emails, WhatsApps, private emails ... whatever\".\n\"I accept that and I apologise if that answer was not as clear,\" Ms Sturgeon said. She also conceded that she had already deleted messages relating to the pandemic when she answered that question on 24 August 2021.\nThe ex-SNP leader went on to reject claims from UK government minister Michael Gove that the Scottish government sought \"political conflict\" during the pandemic.\nBecoming emotional, she insisted \"the idea that in those horrendous days, weeks, I was thinking of political opportunity\" was \"not the case\".\nMs Sturgeon insisted \"difficult\" decisions during the pandemic were made based on \"public health reasons\" and she was motivated solely by minimising the harm of the virus.\nIt came after the inquiry was shown an email which voiced concerns that the Spanish government would block an independent Scotland from joining the EU if it did not lift travel restrictions.\nThe email - copied to the first minister and senior government figures - was sent on 19 July 2020 from then deputy first minister John Swinney's email, but signed off by an official named Scott. He said he was \"extremely concerned\" about travel restrictions remaining on the country when there was a low Covid prevalence rate.\n\"It won't matter how much ministers might justify it on health grounds, the Spanish government will conclude it is entirely political; they won't forget; there is a real possibility they will never approve EU membership for an independent Scotland as a result.\"\nMs Sturgeon was also emotional when she said a \"large part\" of her wished she had not been Scotland's first minister during the pandemic.\nShe said her chief regret of the pandemic was that the Scottish government did not introduce a lockdown one or two weeks earlier than it did in March 2020.

    "Labour has pledged not to increase corporation tax if elected, as part of a drive to win business support ahead of the general election.\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said she would cap the tax at 25% but could cut it to boost \"competitiveness\".\nLabour's pledge would provide \"stability\" to business, who have seen 26 changes to business taxes over the last parliament, she said.\nMs Reeves was speaking at Labour's day-long summit with business leaders.\nIn a keynote speech, the shadow chancellor said \"investment has cratered\" in the UK, due 14 years of economic instability under Conservative governments.\n\"I have heard time and time again from businesses that what they want is stability - including when it comes to tax,\" he said.\nCorporation tax is a levy of all company profits. For firms with profits over \u00c2\u00a3250,000, the top corporation tax rate is 25% - lower than the comparable rate US, Germany, France, and other G7 nations.\nSmaller companies pay a sliding scale of corporation tax, down to 19% for companies that make a profit of \u00c2\u00a350,000 or less.\nMs Reeves sad the UK's top rate \"strikes the correct balance between the needs of our public finances, and the demands of a competitive global economy.\"\nGlobally,140 countries agreed to impose global minimum corporate tax of 15% in 2021.\nBut she added Labour would be willing to cut the rate \"should our competitiveness come under threat\".\n\"That means businesses can plan investment projects today, with the confidence of knowing how their returns will be taxed for the rest of this decade,\" she added.\nOn Wednesday, Labour announced it would not reinstate a bankers' bonus cap that was scrapped last year by the Conservative government.\nMs Reeves said Labour would keep two more recent government announcements.\nThe party plans to keep full expensing, allowing companies to write off new investment costs, as announced by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt in the Autumn Statement. The annual investment allowance announced by Mr Hunt, enabling companies to deduct some investments from taxable profits, will also remain in place.\nIf elected, Labour would also produce a \"roadmap\" for business taxation within six months of being elected to give companies certainty, said Ms Reeves.\n'Party of business'\nHer speech comes as the Labour leadership steps up efforts to win business support ahead of the general election.\nSpeaking to an audience of FTSE 100 chief executives and international investors, she said: \"Be in no doubt, we will campaign as a pro-business party - and we will govern as a pro-business party.\"\nAlso speaking at the event, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that if it wins power, the party plans to introduce its first wave of economic reforms without \"too much legislation\" so they don't get \"bogged down\".\nIn particular, he suggested he wanted to reduce ways to challenge new infrastructure projects through changes to planning guidance in England.\nAmong those at the Oval cricket ground venue, is Iceland's executive chairman Richard Walker, a former Conservative donor who this week switched to Labour.\nTickets for the event sold out in four hours, with hundreds said to be on the waiting list to attend.\nOn Thursday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hosted a panel with small business leaders in Downing Street.\nThe Conservatives have criticised Labour's business credentials - pointing out that the shadow cabinet contains no entrepreneurs - and accused the party of changing stance on economy.\nChief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott said: \"Keir Starmer's record of making promises and then dropping them when they become inconvenient shows Labour will not provide businesses with the stability and certainty they need to invest.\"\nMs Reeves appeared to further water down her own 2021 pledge to spend \u00c2\u00a328bn a year on building a \"green economy\".\nIn June 2023, Ms Reeves said the \u00c2\u00a328bn would not be spent on day one of a Labour government because but would be the target for the second half of a Labour government.\nAsked on Thursday, if Labour was still committed to the plans, Ms Reeves said: \"All policies have to be consistent with our fiscal rules - the green prosperity plan is no exception\".\nShe did not mention the \u00c2\u00a328bn figure specifically.\nLabour's fiscal rules are to borrow only to invest and close the deficit on day-to-day spending make sure government debt is falling by the end the next parliament.",

    "Five members of a crime gang are facing jail terms after a major drugs bust at a heavily-barricaded block of flats.\nThey were caught in 2020 following the raid in Greenock, Inverclyde.\nLee Docherty, 37, Ian Millar, 39, Brendan Gillan, 32, his father Daniel Gillan, 60, and Christopher McKellar, 44, had been due to stand trial at the High Court in Glasgow.\nInstead they pled guilty to a charge of being involved in serious organised crime between March and December 2020.\nThey were remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a later date.\nThe men were arrested after police forces across Europe, led by French and Dutch forces, smashed the EncroChat encrypted phone network which the gang had used to organise drugs trafficking.\nProsecutor Alexander Sutherland said each member had a \"handle\" they were known as on the EncroChat network.\nDocherty, the leader, used \"renegadeball\" or \"goldenshark\"; his brother-in-law Millar was known as \"sarcasticflamingo\", while the Gillans had the names \"unrealegg\" and \"warmhail\".\nMcKellar had the handle \"mrrr-celtic\".

    "The Thai reformist party which won the most votes at last year's election could be dissolved after a court ruled one of its policies unconstitutional.\nMove Forward is not in government but its campaign promise on changing royal defamation laws violated the constitution, a Thai court has found.\nSuch lese majeste laws have increasingly been used to stifle political criticism, activists say.\nIt is possible all of the party's leaders could be banned from politics.\nParty leader Pita Limjaroenrat, a young, Harvard-educated politician, had been viewed as a significant threat to Thailand's monarchy by and military-aligned elite, when he won a majority of votes in the 2023 election.\nHis party campaigned on a progressive agenda - and in particular a pledge to amend the controversial lese majeste law, although much of the party's support was for its other proposed reforms.\nDespite the mandate, Mr Pita's attempts to become prime minister were blocked by the unelected Senate. A coalition made up of other parties eventually formed the government.\nLast week Mr Pita survived another legal case aimed at disqualifying him from parliament. But he and his party failed to win the crucial second case on Wednesday.\nThe Constitutional Court ruled that Move Forward and its leaders \"demonstrated behaviour\" which amounted to calling for the overthrow of Thailand's democratic system of government with the King as Head of State.\nIt ordered them to stop any acts or expression of views, through any medium, which advocated for the abolition of the lese majeste law. It also prohibited amendments to the law by any means other than \"lawful legislative measures\".\nThat suggests it might be possible to change the law through parliament, but that no public discussion or social media debate will be allowed.\nThe verdict carries no immediate penalty but it is widely expected to be used to justify dissolving Move Forward, and banning its leaders from politics for several years.\nGiven the number of times in Thailand that political parties have been dissolved and leaders banned from politics on much flimsier pretexts, there will now be strong pressure to do the same to Move Forward. Some Thais will conclude that this was always the real objective of the petition to the court.\n\"I feel that people are being squeezed again,\" political activist Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, told the BBC. \"The Move Forward party just wanted to amend the lese majeste law. They didn't want to reform the monarchy as we proposed.\"\nIn its election campaign the party shied away from activist demands for a complete abolition of the law, calling only for amendment.\nMove Forward had argued that it was the legitimate role of an elected parliament to scrutinise a law which is part of the regular penal code. Thailand's lese majeste law has already been significantly changed twice.\nBut it is still a powerful tool that is used against dissent, activists say.\nEarlier this month, a 30-year-old man in Bangkok was sentenced to 50 years in jail for criticising the Thai monarchy.\nAnd more than 260 people have been charged under the law since November 2020. It has been used more often since the pro-democracy protests in 2020 that targeted the monarchy, among other things.\nFour years ago Move Forward's previous incarnation, a party called Future Forward, was also dissolved after doing unexpectedly well in an election.\nThat action by the Constitutional Court set off months of student-led protests , in which unprecedented demands were also made for curbing the king's power.\nThen in November 2021 the court ruled that three leading activists - including Panusaya - who called for reform of the monarchy during the months-long protests of 2020 had \"hidden intentions to overthrow the constitutional monarchy\", and ordered them to stop.\nAll three have faced multiple criminal charges since then.\nMany of the other leaders of those protests too still find themselves fighting charges under the lese majeste law, and could face years in prison.\nPanusaya doesn't think young people will come out on the streets this time.\n\"No one dares do anything. They see the leaders being put in jail. They know the risk,\" she said. \"I can't help but think that people are more afraid than before. What we see now is only the dark path. There's no way out.\"\nAdditional reporting by Issariya Praithongyaem in London",
    "Madonna will \"vigorously defend\" legal action brought by fans after she was more than two hours late for a show, her representatives have said.\nThe singer is being sued by two fans who attended her concert last month in New York.\nThe case says the pair \"would not have paid for tickets\" had they know it would finish so late.\nThe US singer's representatives and promoter Live Nation said a technical issue caused the delay.\nThe joint statement read: \"The shows opened in North America at Barclays in Brooklyn as planned, with the exception of a technical issue December 13th during soundcheck.\n\"This caused a delay that was well documented in press reports at the time. We intend to defend this case vigorously.\"\nThe statement added the tour's recent European leg had \"received rave reviews\".\nThe case, brought by Michael Fellows and Jonathan Hadden, states that \"many ticketholders who attended concerts on a weeknight had to get up early to go to work and/or take care of their family responsibilities the next day\".\nThey are suing Live Nation and the Barclays Center for \"false advertising, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair and deceptive trade practices\".\nThe Barclays Center is yet to respond to the lawsuit.\nMr Fellows and Mr Hadden attended the show on Wednesday 13 December 2023 and said it was meant to start at 20:30 EST but it did not begin until after 22:30, ending around 01:00.\nThe lawsuit claims that other nights at the same venue, on 14 and 16 December, also reportedly started more than two hours late.\n\"Defendants failed to provide any notice to the ticketholders that the concerts would start much later than the start time printed on the ticket and as advertised, which resulted in the ticketholders waiting for hours,\" the document state.\nThe court papers also claim Madonna \"has a long history of arriving and starting her concerts late, sometimes several hours late\", citing examples including \"her 2016 Rebel Heart Tour, her 2019-2020 Madame X Tour, and prior tours, where Madonna continuously started her concerts over two hours late\".\nThe plaintiffs are suing for unspecified damages.\nThis is not the first time fans have objected to the singer being late for her shows, and in 2019, a fan sued over a delay for a US show, but he voluntarily dismissed the case a month later, according to ABC News .\nIn the same year, Madonna had shared a post of her live on stage , in which she told fans: \"There's something that you all need to understand. And that is, that a queen is never late.\"\nMadonna's sold-out Celebration tour was a greatest hits show including more than 40 songs from her career, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of her breakout single, Holiday, playing venues including the US, Canada and Europe.\nThe singer had a health scare last summer, after she was found unconscious in her New York apartment in June and rushed to hospital, where she received treatment for a serious bacterial infection.\nShe later said she was \"lucky to be alive\" , and postponed the start of the tour from July to October last year.",
    "The Post Office chairman was sacked because it \"just wasn't working\", the business secretary says.\nKemi Badenoch told the BBC that Henry Staunton's departure was about more than just the Horizon scandal, in the wake of public outcry over the wrongful convictions of sub-postmasters.\nMs Badenoch said she removed him after concerns about Post Office governance and \"the entire business model\".\nLabour called on the government to give more specific reasons for its decision.\nMr Staunton left the role  - which he had been appointed to in December 2022 - on Saturday. The BBC has approached him for comment.\nThe Post Office said Mr Staunton had been asked to go by Ms Badenoch.\nAppearing on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Ms Badenoch said it was very difficult for someone to be asked to stand down from a position.\nBut, she continued: \"I decided given all of the difficulties the Post Office is having, it's not just about Horizon, it's about the entire business model, how we make it work, that we needed someone who could chair a board that was able to deal with these things effectively.\"\nShe explained that one of her priorities was the governance of the Post Office, and said: \"That was where my deciding that we needed a new chair of the organisation was important. It just wasn't working.\"\nMs Badenoch added that there were \"various disagreements\" within the board \"and when I looked at it I thought change of personnel was what was required\".\nShe declined to rule out further personnel changes when appearing on Sky's Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips and referred to \"difficulties\" and other board members.\nOn Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she declined to set a deadline to deliver full compensation for those affected - echoing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's position. But Ms Badenoch promised \"we couldn't move any faster than we already have been\".\n\"Setting a deadline is not the priority,\" she said.\n\"Getting the money out, getting fair compensation, sorting out the governance of the Post Office, is the critical thing.\"\nIt comes as the Post Office is reeling from the fallout from the Horizon scandal, which has been called the biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history.\nMore than 700 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were prosecuted between 1999 and 2015 after faulty accounting software Horizon made it look as though money was missing from their shops.\nMany of those affected were financially ruined.\nAs part of the role, advertised with a salary of up to \u00c2\u00a3150,000, he had been tasked with leading the board of directors and working to right the wrongs of the Horizon dispute.\nBefore that, he had worked on the board of companies ranging from ITV to WH Smith.\nA Post Office spokesperson said: \"On Saturday afternoon, the Post Office was informed that the business and trade secretary had asked Henry Staunton to stand down as chairman of the Post Office.\n\"We have been advised by the government that they will appoint an interim chairman shortly.\"\nThey later said the Post Office was \"actively supportive of efforts to compensate postmasters fairly and quickly, and determined in its wish to help right the wrongs of the past\".\n\"As part of this process, in 2021 Post Office changed its governance structure, appointing two serving postmasters to the board, and is making progress on its commitment to replace the upgraded Horizon system with a new and appropriately funded modern solution,\" they said.\n\"While progress has been made with over \u00c2\u00a3150m paid in compensation, there remains much work to do to ensure that full justice and compensation are delivered, and to make sure that this can never happen again.\"\nAlso appearing on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Labour's shadow business secretary branded the government's decision to ask Mr Staunton to go \"quite unusual\".\n\"The government have to tell us why they made this decision seemingly yesterday\", Jonathan Reynolds said.\n\"The person who's going wasn't actually there for the scandal, so there must be specific reasons why they don't have confidence in that person going on.\"\nThe Horizon scandal recently came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama. and public anger led to the former Post Office boss Paula Vennells handing back her CBE.\nSenior figures from the Post Office and the technology firm Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon software, are currently facing questions at a public inquiry over what happened.\nThe Conservative peer James Arbuthnot, who has campaigned on behalf of sub-post masters, told the BBC he was surprised that Mr Staunton had left the role.\nHe said the departure was an opportunity to change the culture and governance of the organisation.\nSome of his fellow campaigners have accused the Post Office leadership of being too slow to deliver compensation, and too quick to hand out bonuses to senior managers.\nTheir hope is that the appointment of a new chairman will signal the start of more wide-ranging changes.\nHave you been personally affected by",

    "Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter over the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\nMs Hutchins was shot dead on the set of Rust, a forthcoming Western filmed near Santa Fe in New Mexico in October 2021.\nMr Baldwin, 65, had been practising firing a pistol for a scene.\nSimilar charges were dropped in April, just two weeks before he was due to go on trial, but New Mexico prosecutors say there is new forensic evidence.\nThe actor entered the not guilty plea in a court filing on Wednesday, a day before a scheduled virtual court appearance in a Santa Fe court, which will now not take place.\nHe was charged on 19 January in New Mexico after local prosecutors said \"additional facts\" had emerged from forensic tests on the weapon used in the shooting, in which director Joel Souza was also wounded.\nMr Baldwin has maintained he did not pull the trigger of the Colt .45 pistol and only drew back its hammer.\nHe has also argued he is not at fault for Ms Hutchins' death because he did not know the weapon contained live rounds and because no live ammunition was supposed to be on set.\nBut special prosecutors in New Mexico said in October that they had commissioned forensic experts to reconstruct the weapon, after it had been broken during FBI testing.\nThey said doing so had revealed that the incident could only have taken place if the trigger had been pulled.\n\"Although Alec Baldwin repeatedly denies pulling the trigger, given the tests, findings and observations reported here, the trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer of the evidence revolver,\" their report concluded.\nThe actor - who has expressed \"shock and sadness\" at Ms Hutchins' death - said in recent court filings that he had struggled to find acting work since the incident.\nWhen prosecutors dropped involuntary manslaughter charges in April they warned that they could be refiled as investigations continued.",
    "The Republican primary race is not officially over but with no obvious pathway to victory for Nikki Haley, a general election showdown between two adversaries is coming into view.\nWe are months away from the Democratic and Republican conventions, the moment when each party officially unveils its presidential nominee.\nBut the 2024 election seems all but set in stone.\nThe contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be unique in modern history as a rematch between the current president and his immediate predecessor.\n\"Having two presidents running changes the nature of the race,\" says Todd Belt, a politics professor at George Washington University.\n\"This is a comparison, not just a referendum on the incumbent. There are no blank slates going into this election.\"\nThe contrast will be simple, according to Sean Spicer, who served as Mr Trump's first press secretary and worked for the Republican National Committee prior to that.\n\"For those people who say, well, during Trump, the policies of Donald Trump made my life better, more secure, made the economy and our communities better, it's a no brainer.\"\nThe Trump campaign has every motivation to go on the attack against Mr Biden, in part to distract from his own weaknesses - including his legal troubles, his divisive rhetoric and his attempts to undermine the 2020 election results, which contributed to the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol.\nBut Mr Biden also has key vulnerabilities, struggling to sell his first-term achievements and trying to convince the public he has the energy for the campaign and a second term.\nAlready in this presidential race he is painting his predecessor as out-of-control and a threat to America, and to democracy itself.\n\"Usually, that's what you do when you're running against somebody who's unknown in politics,\" says Susan Estrich, a Democratic author and analyst who managed Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign in 1988.\n\"But here, you've got somebody who's very well known, and you're just trying to prove he's a big risk.\"\nIt's a rematch few Americans say they want - a bare-knuckle, nasty slog of a campaign - but it's a presidential choice that at this point they seem almost certain to get.\nClose race on a small map\nMr Biden's approval ratings continue to languish in dangerous territory for an incumbent entering an election year. Public perceptions of Mr Trump are also negative, however.\nBy all indications, November's general election is going to be tight. National polls show the two candidates either neck and neck or Mr Trump with a slight advantage.\nBut this early in the race they are of limited usefulness, given the nature of the US political map. While Americans will head to the polls across the nation, this race will once again be decided in only a handful of states.\nThat's because the electoral college, the system the US has to pick its president, depends on candidates winning each state and most states are solidly Democratic or Republican.\nThe most crucial states that could go either way this year include Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan in the so-called Rust Belt, and Arizona and Georgia, two states that Mr Biden flipped Democratic in 2020.\nNevada is also considered a toss-up but its small population makes it a less valuable prize.\nA few states that have been battlegrounds in previous election cycles have slipped off this map - Florida and North Carolina have trended Republican of late, while Virginia and Colorado appear to be more solidly Democratic.\nSo while national polls provide fodder for political commentators, a much smaller subset of voters will ultimately be the ones who matter.\nPolling in November that showed Mr Trump inching ahead in these key states caused alarm among some Democrats, but polls a year from the election are not necessarily accurate predictors of the outcome.\nThe economy (again)\nWhen it comes down to it, Americans tend to vote from their wallets in national elections - for the governing party in good times and the opposition in bad.\n\"It's the economy, stupid\" was the mantra of Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign, and the refrain has become political gospel in the decades since.\nOne of the factors that makes 2024 challenging to predict is that, on the whole, economic indicators are positive.\nIf you're in the UK, sign up here.\nAnd if you're anywhere else, sign up here.\nThe economy is growing at a steady clip. Unemployment is near record lows. The stock market is hitting record highs. And yet American voters continue to have a grim view of their economic situation.\nSome of this can be attributed to several years of high inflation and the continuing high cost of housing in many parts of the US. Home sales in the US have sunk to the lowest levels in nearly 30 years.\nAt the Trump victory party in Iowa, two large video screens cycled through graphics showing how rising home mortgage interest rates during the Biden administration have driven up monthly home payments.\nThere are some recen",

    "A Turner Prize-winning sculpture depicting a tropical fruit has been installed on a university campus.\nBreadfruit, by Veronica Ryan, was placed outside the University of Warwick's Arts Centre on Monday.\nThe 3ft-tall (0.9m) bronze is a tribute to the Windrush generation and represents the cultural and historical significance of the staple island food.\nThe university said it was \"thrilled\" to acquire the piece to add to 25 others in a sculpture park in Coventry.\nMontserrat-born British sculptor Ryan won the Turner Prize in 2022 for her Windrush memorial , which consisted of giant sculptures of Caribbean fruits including Breadfruit.\n\"Representation and cultural visibility being evident in public spaces is crucial. I'm pleased Breadfruit will be at the University of Warwick,\" she said.\nThe starchy foodstuff, whose pulp has a bread-like consistency when cooked, has been a staple in the Pacific Islands for centuries and wood from its tree is also used to make homes and boats.\nIn the 18th Century, Captain William Bligh led a famous expedition on HMS Bounty to transport the plant from Tahiti to the Caribbean to provide a cheaper food source for slaves.\nRebecca Earle, a food historian and a professor of history at the university, said breadfruit's continued popularity in Caribbean cuisine was down to \"the ingenuity of ordinary people\".\n\"It symbolises many aspects of the Caribbean's complex history,\" she added. \"[It] reminds us of our interconnected histories and of the importance of food to our lives.\"\nUniversity curator Thomas Ellmer said the work was about \"memory and the notion of trying to find a place within the world\".\n\"The sculpture is representative of many members of the student and academic and staff body here,\" he added.\nStudent Amelia Wilson, from Grenada, said she was \"excited\" to see the \"culturally significant\" fruit represented on campus.\n\"I think it's really important to share our cultural ties and community through food,\" she added.\n\"I think that's something that is really underlooked whenever we talk about the British Caribbean community.\"\nFunding to acquire the sculpture was provided by the Victoria and Albert Museum, The Contemporary Arts Society, the Arts Council and the University of Warwick.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Oil and gas giant Shell has reported lower annual profits due to energy prices falling last year.\nProfits were $28.2bn (\u00c2\u00a322.3bn) in 2023, down from $39.9bn in 2022 which was the company's highest earnings in its 115-year history.\nEnergy firms made record earnings when oil and gas prices soared in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine amid fears of supply problems.\nHouseholds bills have eased since 2022, but remain at a high level.\nThe price of gas and electricity, as well as petrol and diesel, first began to climb after the end of Covid lockdowns, but surged in March 2022 after the outbreak of war in Ukraine due to concerns over supplies.\nThe price of Brent crude oil reached nearly $128 a barrel following the invasion, but has since fallen back and is currently at about $80. Gas prices also spiked but have come down from their highs.\nThe 2022 surge in prices led to all energy companies, including the likes of Shell and BP, to make bumper profits. In response, the government introduced a windfall tax - called the Energy Profits Levy - on the \"extraordinary\" earnings of firms on their UK operations to help fund a scheme to subsidise gas and electricity bills.\nShell confirmed it paid \u00c2\u00a3178m in UK windfall tax for 2022. A company spokeswoman said the company paid \u00c2\u00a31.1bn in overall tax in the UK for 2023, of which \u00c2\u00a3240m was taxed under the Energy Profits Levy.\nMeanwhile, Shell said it returned $23bn to its shareholders in 2023, and was now increasing its dividend by 4% and beginning a $3.5bn share buyback programme over the next three months.\nShell said the fall in profit last year was a result of lower oil and gas prices, as well as lower volumes being traded and lower margins for refining, which is the process when crude oil, the raw material extracted from the earth, is made into products such as diesel.\nIt added 2023 saw higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading. Many European countries turned to LNG as an alternative source of energy after Russia cut its supplies of natural gas to continent.\nAs a result, the British company posted profits of $7.3bn in the final three months of 2023, which exceeded analysts' expectations but was down from a record $9.8bn in the same period the year before.\nJamie Maddock, energy analyst at wealth management business Quilter Cheviot, said Shell's strong results were driven by its gas division.\nHe warned that oil and gas prices were likely to remain \"unpredictable\" in 2024 with geopolitical tensions remaining high in the Middle East.\n\"It is these sorts of environments that energy giants can thrive in, as we saw in 2022, so it wouldn't be a shock to see Shell continuing to deliver over the course of the year,\" he added.\nJonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner at Global Witness, accused Shell of \"choosing climate-wrecking U-turns and shareholder pay-outs\" as a result of its strong profits, rather than \"investing in clean energy\".\nWael Sawan, Shell's chief executive, said the company in 2024 would continue to \"simplify our organisation with a focus on delivering more value with less emissions\".",
    "A former gang member was forced to traffic guns and drugs for more than 10 years before he was identified as a victim of child criminal exploitation.\nSosa Henkoma was nine years old when he was recruited to deliver packages for the violent gang.\nTrapped in a life of crime for the next decade, he ran guns and drugs between London and Liverpool.\nHe said he counts himself lucky to still be alive after he was stabbed at least 11 times and shot at twice.\nIt was only after Sosa was convicted and jailed that authorities deemed him to be a victim.\n\"I saw people die on the streets, I nearly died myself,\" he said.\n\"Even if I tried to escape the life, I couldn't. As far as I was concerned, it was where I was going to die. And it was like I was dead inside.\"\nSosa told his story as part of a BBC North West investigation which found:\nThe Local Government Association admitted providing support for children was becoming \"increasingly challenging\" for cash-strapped councils, while the Children's Commissioner for England said the BBC's findings were \"only the tip of the iceberg\".\nSosa, who came to England from Nigeria aged eight, was living in care after suffering horrific abuse at home.\nSoon afterwards, he was asked to drop off parcels for a drugs gang in South London.\n\"I didn't know what it was,\" Sosa said. \"I used to see them in the park and just saw some people wanting to help me and I wanted to please them, so I did it.\n\"I had a bike and they just gave me the parcels to drop off and I picked up the cash. I was nine - I didn't ask questions, I just did the favour.\"\nSosa was then sent to Margate on the Kent coast to hand out more parcels, unaware he was being used as a drugs mule for a county lines operation - where city gangs extend their activities into small towns across the country.\n\"I was there for three days,\" he said. \"Then on the third day, a gang of masked men burst through the door with shotguns and machetes and held a shotgun to my head. It was terrifying.\"\nScared for his life, Sosa said he went to social services and told them everything.\n\"They thought I was making it up,\" he said. \"They said I was 'fantasising'.\"\nSosa felt he had no choice but to go back to the gang that had raided the house and they vowed to protect him from rivals.\n\"I had no-one at the time, only them,\" he explained. \"So I stuck around. They looked after me, showed me stuff.\"\nThey taught him how to deal drugs around the housing block where they operated - and gave the then 12-year-old a revolver.\n\"They taught me how to fire it [and] said if I didn't shoot when they asked then they'd shoot me,\" he said.\nGang life\nSosa was put to work as a \"mini enforcer\", running drugs and guns from London to Liverpool.\n\"I was their little prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9, their child soldier,\" he said. \"They loved having this kid who'd do anything for them, anything they said.\"\nHe spent years entrenched in gang life and still bears the brutal scars.\n\"I was stabbed at least 11 times,\" he said. \"I was shot at but never hit. I had this street name: The Devil That Walks On Earth.\"\nSosa was eventually arrested at 14 and charged with possession of firearms and causing grievous bodily harm.\nHe said the birth of his daughters - one during another stretch in prison for firearms offences before his 18th birthday - brought him back from the brink.\n\"I just thought, 'I have to save myself'. And my daughters were the reason to do it,\" he said.\nWhile in prison for the second time, Sosa was assessed by a psychiatrist and, after a series of tests, was found to have been groomed.\nUnder the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), he was flagged as a modern slavery victim in 2020 and put in a safe house in Manchester.\nA report, shared exclusively with the BBC, highlighted inadequate police and council resources when it comes to identifying children at risk, making referrals into the NRM and supporting child victims.\nIt said there was a \"lack of a comprehensive and overarching child exploitation strategy\" and half of all authorities that made referrals from 2018-2023 could not provide basic information on the children referred.\nThe report was written by the Every Child Protected Against Trafficking (Ecpat) charity, working with the University of Nottingham.\nResearchers used data from a six-month online survey and a series of Freedom of Information requests submitted to local authorities.\nMs De Souza said official figures did not scratch the surface and she had seen a real rise in child criminal exploitation since the pandemic.\n\"We are treating them as criminals instead of seeing [their] vulnerability,\" she said. \"They are victims of criminal exploitation, yet many are still being seen as perpetrators.\n\"Local authorities are well trained in how to spot neglect and abuse in the home but can they spot it when it's happening outside? That's what we need to get to.\"\nShe said powers available to local authorities should be reviewed and more \"joined-up thinking\" was needed.\nCouncillor Louise Gittins, who chairs ",

    "A collection of remarkable and often hidden stories of Muslim women who helped shape the history of Britain have been revealed and documented in a new book.\nIt covers the lives of women, from an aristocrat to a cafe owner and World War Two spy, and reinstates them as \"actors, storytellers and story makers,\" the authors said.\n\"Muslim women were key contributors not just to British Muslim history but to all of British history,\" said sociologist Prof Sariya Cheruvallil-Contractor, of Coventry University.\n\"If we are to understand who we are as a society we have got to understand all of our contributions,\" she added.\nShe has worked with co-editor and historian Dr Jamie Gilham to curate stories from a range of contributors, often from \"very scarce source material,\" she said.\n\"These women came from communities that experienced precarious and difficult challenges - racism, prejudice towards their marriages and children, wars, financial insecurity, patriarchy and the problematic citizenship status of their husbands,\" she explained.\n\"Preserving their records and life histories was perhaps the last thing on their minds.\"\nThe publication tells the stories of those who lived in Britain between the mid 19th and mid 20th Centuries, before immigration profoundly affected the size and composition of Britain's Muslim communities.\nIn the book, Muslim Women in Britain, Prof Cheruvallil-Contractor writes about the life of Olive Salaman, helping shed light on the contribution of working class women.\nOlive was 15 years old when she moved from a small town in the Rhondda Valley to Cardiff to train as a nurse.\nOne afternoon, trying to find her way home after a cinema trip, she stopped to ask a young Yemeni sailor for directions.\n\"We started talking and I think we fell in love there and then,\" she told a BBC documentary in 1968 .\nThe man she had asked directions of was Ali Salaman, a young chef working in his own cafe in the Tiger Bay area of the city.\nAfter they married in 1937, she converted to Islam, lived through WW2, had 10 children of her own and fostered and adopted many more, becoming known as the \"mother of the Cardiff Yemenis\" and a legendary anchor of her community.\nThe couple ran the area's popular Cairo Cafe, which became a hub for community life.\nHer story was an \"important one\", said the academic, who had gathered information using the BBC interview and oral history recordings.\n\"Mixed ethnicity marriages were not commonplace, they were frowned upon significantly in those times.\"\nHer social class had \"added another layer of invisibility, further cloaking these women's lives,\" she added.\n\"It was amazing when I started digging into these histories, I found not only were they alive and kicking and really active in their communities.\"\nTwo of the first British mosques \"had women at the very centre of their establishment,\" she said.\n\"The one in Woking was funded by a woman and one in Liverpool a woman, Lady Fatima Cates, was its founding treasurer.\"\nOne of the first known female converts to Islam in Britain, Cates's story was \"often cited\" in discussions about the early Liverpool Muslim community, \"yet very little has been written about her life,\" said contributor Hamid Mahmood.\nIn the book he charts her life from a strict Christian household, her route to Islam at the the Abdullah Quilliam in Liverpool via the Temperance Movement, until her death in 1900.\nHer grave in the city's Anfield Cemetery lay unmarked until Mr Mahmood, who founded a madrassah school named after her in London, revealed it.\n\"Fatima's life and struggle against persecution, violence and Islamophobia more than a century ago is now being rediscovered by British Muslims,\" he writes.\nIn 2022, a stone was finally placed on her unmarked grave, commemorating her life and significance.\n\"It's much harder to find resources about women and it was important to get their stories out,\" explained Prof Cheruvallil-Contractor.\n\"But if women were from the middle or upper middle classes there tended to be archival sources - their families hold material, their letters,\" she said.\n\"A case in point is Lady Evelyn Cobbold - her mother used to be lady in waiting to the Queen.\n\"We know a lot about her now, how she converts to Islam, a few years later performs the Hajj [pilgrimage to Mecca], writes a book about it. Now we know a lot about her but 15 years ago we knew nothing.\n\"Her family still has two big boxes full of letters, but a women like Olive Salaman - her family had existential crises, they didn't know on occasion where their next meal was going to come from, and so archives were the last thing on their mind.\"\nDr Gilham, who has been researching the history of Islam for more than 20 years, tells the story of quite a different aristocratic Englishwoman Gladys Milton Brooke.\nHer unusual religious conversion ceremony - in 1932 above the English Channel on a flight between London and Paris - made headlines around the world.\nShe subsequently explained why she had become a Mus",

The fear and pain of the deceased victims was indescribable,\" Japanese broadcaster NHK reported him saying.\nMany of the animation staff - young artists - were killed after being trapped on the upper floors of the studio as the fire spread.\nThe attack was one of the deadliest cases in recent decades and sparked national mourning in Japan. The country's public and media have followed the case closely.\nProsecutors had demanded the death penalty for Aoba, saying he was motivated to attack the studio after believing his work had been stolen. He said Kyoto Animation - known as KyoAni-  had plagiarised a novel he entered into their contest.\nIn July 2019, he burst into the studio during a work day, splashing petrol on the ground floor and setting it alight while repeatedly shouting \"Drop dead\".\nHe later said during his guilty plea in September 2023 that he did not think so many people would die.\n\"I felt I had no other option but to do what I did,\" he said at the time.\n\"I feel tremendously sorry and the feeling includes a sense of guilt.\"\nAoba himself suffered burns to over 90% of his body in the fire, and was only arrested after he had recovered from operations.\n\"The delusion that KyoAni Studio had plagiarised his work influenced his motivation,\" prosecutors had told the court.\nBut they said he was not controlled by such delusions and had full capacity and understanding of his actions.\nOn Thursday, the judge read out a lengthy reasoning with victim testimonies before announcing the verdict. More than half of the animation studio's 70-strong workforce was killed in the event, and another 32 injured.\n\"Some of them saw their colleagues engulfed in flames, and some of them are suffering from psychological effects, and they are tormented by feelings of guilt and remorse,\" said Judge Masuda.\nFamilies of the victims were seen in the court room, with many visibly emotional as the judge read out the details of Aoba's crime, NHK reported.\nThe outlet reported that Aoba kept his head bowed as the judge read out the death penalty sentence.\nJapan retains capital punishment for its most serious crimes, like multiple murders. Those convicted typically remain on death row for years, or even decades. The death penalty is conducted by hanging.\nThe KyoAni studio in Kyoto is a beloved institution, known for producing films and graphic novels that are well-regarded by fans as well as critics - including K-On! and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.",

    "An attack on police officers in New York City's Times Square, allegedly by a group of migrants, most of whom were released on bail, has sparked a US election-year political furore.\nAt least 12 suspects were allegedly involved in last weekend's attack. Six have been arrested.\nFive of those were released on bail and the rest remain at large. One remains in jail.\nImmigration is a hot issue ahead of the November 2024 US general election.\nMore than 6.3m migrants are recorded to have crossed into the US illegally since 2021, record highs that could affect the re-election chances of President Joe Biden, a Democrat.\nThe melee broke out on Saturday evening after three New York Police Department officers attempted to break up a disorderly group of men outside a migrant shelter in Midtown Manhattan.\nWhen the officers tried to arrest one of the men, CCTV footage shows them being attacked by assailants. The officers were left with minor injuries.\nAs controversy over the Times Square fracas mounted in recent days, some Democrats have joined Republicans in calling for the suspects to be deported.\nKathy Hochul, New York's Democratic governor, said on Thursday authorities should \"get them all and send them back\".\n\"You don't touch our police officers - you don't touch anybody,\" she told reporters.\nAssaulting a police officer is considered a federal crime in the US, and it can serve as grounds for deportation.\nNicole Malliotakis, a Republican congresswoman who represents Staten Island, a borough of New York City, said: \"It is absolutely disgusting that people who are in this country, that are being housed by the taxpayers, would turn around and disrespect our laws and our law enforcement.\"\nRepublicans in New York are calling for the governor to send National Guard troops to the US borders with Canada and Mexico to help stem the flow of migrants.\nThe New York Police Department has also expressed anger over the incident.\nPatrick Hendry, president of the Police Benevolent Association, the largest police union in New York, has questioned why the other suspects were released.\nYohenry Brito, 24, is the only migrant accused of involvement in the attack who remains in jail.\nOn Thursday, a judge ruled that Mr Brito would be held on $15,000 bail for second-degree assault and obstructing governmental administration.\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office said the other suspects were released as evidence is still being gathered.\nCiting law enforcement sources, the New York Post reports that four of the accused have fled on a bus bound for California.",
    "Off-peak Tube and train fares all day on Fridays will be trialled by Transport for London (TfL) in a bid to boost passenger numbers and support the capital's economy.\nSadiq Khan has asked TfL to launch a three-month trial in March.\nHe said the organisation's usage data showed Fridays were quieter than any other week day.\nSusan Hall, the Conservative mayoral candidate, said the trial would not make any difference.\nTfL said that midweek Tube usage was at 85% compared to pre-pandemic levels and Friday usage was about 73%.\nMr Khan said: \"London has really bounced back since the pandemic, but the lack of commuters returning on Fridays is a clear exception - with a major knock-on effect on our shops, cafes and cultural venues.\n\"That's why I've asked TfL to trial off-peak fares on Fridays, and I encourage Londoners to get involved.\"\nAmit Patel, who works in a newsagent opposite Marylebone Train Station said their trade on a Friday had trailed off since the pandemic.\n\"We've got to make ends meet,\" he said. \"So we've just got to try and cope.\n\"It's not anywhere close to what it used to be.\"\nTom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent\nGo into a lot of ticket halls at 09:28 GMT and you will see travellers waiting for off-peak to start so they can get a cheaper fare.\nThere is no doubt, commuters are sensitive to fare changes.\nMaking Fridays off-peak is innovative, but other cities in Europe go much further and offer free public transport all the time.\nSince the pandemic things have changed and working from home has killed off Fridays in the office for many and London's transport is much quieter. The mayor hopes this will bring them back.\nThe big question is will this cost Transport for London lost revenue or will returning numbers make this revenue neutral? And will saving a few pounds be a big enough of a draw for those at home on a Friday?\nAlso it looks like the practicalities still need to be worked out with the train companies.\nPolitically, of course the context is a mayoral election looms in May. And the incumbent Labour mayor Sadiq Khan is trying to put the cost of living firmly on the agenda.\nHis critics and opponents will say this is nothing more than a cynical election bung.\nPeak fares apply from 06:30 to 09:30 and from 16:00 to 19:00 on both TfL and National Rail services in London.\nMs Hall said commuters \"might change their habits slightly\" but the saving was not enough to make a major difference.\n\"If people are doing a three-day week [in the office], they'll just change their days and not come in another day,\" she said.\nThe announcement comes a week after Mr Khan said he was freezing TfL fares for another year from March .\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the trial was \"exactly the type of flexible approach needed to boost journey numbers and stimulate footfall\".\nAnd Chris Hayward, City of London Corporation policy chairman called it a \"welcome shot in the arm to our businesses\".\nRob Blackie, of the London Assembly's Liberal Democrats, said: \"It's a great idea to cut fares on Fridays, when the Tube is less crowded. However 'dynamic pricing' has to be about using spare capacity.\n\"Any dynamic model must only offer discounts for travelling during less periods or in less busy places.\"\nZo\u00c3\u00ab Garbett, the Green Party's candidate said she welcomed any TfL fare cuts but added: \"But this feels like a gimmick rather than something that will actually help many Londoners.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Scotland's former deputy first minister has told the UK Covid inquiry that he manually deleted messages sent to Nicola Sturgeon during the pandemic.\nJohn Swinney said the texts with the ex-first minister were \"not available\".\nThe SNP MSP said they had been removed in line with his understanding of Scottish government records policy.\nMr Swinney also denied a suggestion that Scottish cabinet meetings were \"driven\" by Ms Sturgeon's \"strong mindedness\".\nIt came after ex-finance secretary Kate Forbes said she was surprised no minutes were kept from top-level meetings during the Covid crisis.\nMr Swinney served as deputy first minister and education secretary until May 2021. Following a reshuffle, he left the latter role to become Covid recovery secretary.\nHe stepped down from government in March 2023.\nThe inquiry had already heard that none of his WhatsApps or \"similar messages\" had been retained.\nA document supplied to the inquiry stated the texts had been either deleted manually or by using an auto-delete function.\nThe former deputy first minister told the inquiry he rarely spoke to Ms Sturgeon via text messages or other informal means.\nHe said texts were generally only used to set up a phone call.\nMr Swinney told the inquiry that since entering government in 2007 he had \"deleted material after I have made sure any relevant information was placed on the official record of the government, and that was the approach I was advised to take\".\nHe said this approach was never \"questioned\" in previous years in government and was \"consistent\" with the ministerial code.\nThe former deputy first minister conceded that it \"might well be the case\" that all the information needed by the inquiry might not be retained.\nHe said he would apologise \"unreservedly\" if he had \"misunderstood\" the government's records management policy.\n\"My intention was never to do anything other than ensure the official record was furnished with all of the information that it needed to have,\" Mr Swinney said.\nThe inquiry was sent 18 pages of WhatsApp messages between Mr Swinney and current First Minister Humza Yousaf from during the pandemic.\nThey were recovered from an old handset of Mr Yousaf's after Mr Swinney erased his messages, the inquiry heard.\n\"They would be deleted by periodic deletion once I was satisfied I had told my private office any info that was relevant so that I was not facing a large number of messages that I would potentially have to delete on one occasion,\" Mr Swinney added.\nThe inquiry was also shown messages from 14 December 2021, following cabinet talks, between then health secretary Mr Yousaf and national clinical director Jason Leitch.\nAt the meeting, Mr Yousaf had suggested unexpectedly that he may be able to make \u00c2\u00a3100m from the health budget available for business support as the government considered another lockdown.\nIn the messages, Mr Yousaf told Mr Leitch that Ms Sturgeon had been \"ranting\" at him and he had taken \"one hell of a bullet\".\nMr Leitch said Ms Sturgeon was being \"ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous\" and that he \"almost intervened\".\nCounsel to the inquiry, Jamie Dawson KC, put it to Mr Swinney that the culture of the Scottish cabinet was driven by Ms Sturgeon's \"strong mindedness when challenging her was seen as taking a bullet\".\nMr Swinney said: \"No, because I think that particular morning, the first minister was a little bit surprised that the health portfolio had been able to find \u00c2\u00a3100m to transfer to business support.\n\"In all my 10 years of handling the public finances of Scotland, the health secretary never offered me \u00c2\u00a3100m in exchange for anything.\"\nHe insisted the cabinet had \"open and full discussions\".\nMs Forbes, in messages about the same cabinet meeting, said she had \"never seen the FM this angry in all my cabinets for good reason\".\nShe told the inquiry that while \"surprises\" were not typically welcome at cabinet, Mr Yousaf had tried to be \"helpful\" and had not tried to \"undermine the process\".\nSchool closures\nMr Swinney told the inquiry that the decision to close schools in March 2020 was made during a conversation between him and Ms Sturgeon, not in a discussion involving the full cabinet.\nThe former deputy first minister said this was because \"events were moving at an absolutely ferocious pace\".\nHe added the Scottish government \"did not have the time or the opportunity\" to complete an equality impact assessment on children's learning and development if schools were closed.\nEarlier, the inquiry heard that the Scottish government's equivalent of Cobra meetings - the Scottish Government Resilience Room (SGoRR) - had not been minuted.\nNeither were records kept for so-called \"gold command\" meetings - attended by Ms Sturgeon, a small group of advisers and a revolving group of ministers.\nMs Forbes confirmed to the inquiry she did not attend any of the \"gold command\" discussions in 2020.\nAsked by inquiry chairwoman Lady Hallett why she was not invited despite her seniority, Ms Forbes said she was \"not",

Two have been released on bail.\nThe two teenagers were attacked by a group of people in Ilminster Avenue on Saturday at around 23:20 GMT.\nMembers of the public and police officers went to the boys' aid but they later died of their injuries in hospital.\nDetectives from the force's major crime investigation team said the charge is a \"pivotal moment\" in the inquiry and that more than 100 officers and staff are working on the case.\nThe murder charges were authorised by the Crown Prosecution Service after a review of the evidence put together by the investigation team.\nMax's mum and sister paid emotional tributes to the teenagers earlier, urging parents to search their children's bags and keep them safe.\nLeanne Dixon said: \"This world is never ever going to be the same without them.\"\nTwo boys, aged 15 and 16, have been arrested on suspicion of murder, while a 46-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.\nA 15-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of murder has since been bailed with conditions including to not enter Bristol.\nA 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody, along with a 26-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.\nA 20-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder and possession of an offensive weapon in a private place has been released with no further action in relation to the murder offence and bailed in relation to the offensive weapon offence.\nDet Supt Gary Haskins, head of the murder investigations team, said: \"This is a pivotal moment in our investigation and Mason's and Max's families have both been informed of this development.\n\"Specialist family liaison officers are providing them with support and we continue to ask their privacy is respected and they are given space to grieve.\n\"In the meantime, we'd like to remind people of the impact speculation, footage and images on social media could have on both Mason's and Max's families as well as on forthcoming proceedings.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Almost 2,000 driving test examiners will strike for four consecutive days next month in a row over workloads.\nThe walkouts across 270 test centres in England, Scotland and Wales will take place from 8 to 11 February.\nExaminers will strike in protest at \"flawed\" plans demanding they deliver 150,000 more tests by the end of March to help clear a backlog.\nThe DVSA (Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency) branded the strike decision \"disappointing\".\nAll eligible managers and administrative staff in the DVSA have been asked to return to carrying out driving tests full time in a bid to hit the target.\nBut examiners fear delivering the extra tests could pose \"significant\" safety risks for them and their customers, and will erode their terms and conditions.\nLong waits\nWaiting times for a driving test soared to an average peak of 24 weeks in November 2022, partly down to Covid lockdowns over the previous two years.\nBefore the pandemic, the average wait time from booking the test online was about six weeks.\nThe Public and Commercial Services union general secretary Mark Serwotka said examiners want to maintain high standards but are \"unable to do that if they're expected to work longer and longer hours\".\n\"If Mark Harper (Transport Secretary) was serious about reducing the backlog, he would invest in DVSA, employing more examiners, not just expecting the existing ones to work harder,\" he added.\nDVSA chief executive Loveday Ryder said the strike action would cause an impact to its services, but said candidates should attend their test as usual unless they were contacted directly.\nShe added: \"Learners expect a seven-day per week service, and, as a publicly funded body, DVSA wants to provide that.\"\nDriving instructor Naughton Dunn, from Ludlow, Shropshire, told the BBC in December that candidates as far away as Essex and Edinburgh had contacted him for lessons .\nThey had booked tests in the town after searching nationwide and wanted to familiarise themselves with the likely route, he said.\nLast year, the DVSA announced other measures to help tackle the backlog .\nThey included changing rules to stop drivers booking tests before they are ready and lengthening the wait for a retest for those who fail.\nIn December, the average wait time fell to 17.4 weeks with more than 150,000 tests - a record for the month - carried out, according to the DVSA.\nIt has previously pledged to take \"all measures we can to reduce driving test waiting times\" including the recruitment of almost 500 new driving examiners.",

    "UN chief Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres has urged countries that halted funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, to continue its operations.\n\"The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met,\" Mr Guterres said.\nNine countries, including the UK, have taken action since Israel told UNRWA some staff were involved in the 7 October deadly Hamas attacks on Israel.\nThe agency says it is investigating and has already sacked some employees.\nThe countries that have now suspended funding UNRWA are Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and the US.\nCreated in 1949, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, is the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza. It provides healthcare, education and other humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It employs around 13,000 people inside Gaza.\nSince Israel began its offensive in response to the Hamas attacks UNRWA has used its facilities across Gaza to shelter hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians.\nIsrael has long accused different branches of the UN - including UNRWA - of bias and even of antisemitism.\nDetails about the Israeli allegations have not been made clear, but reports in the Israeli media suggest UNRWA vehicles and facilities may have been used for the attack in which Hamas gunmen killed around 1,300 people, mostly civilians, and took another 240 hostage.\nAn adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday told the BBC that the 7 October Hamas attacks had involved \"people who are on their [UNRWA] salaries\".\nMr Regev also referred to an Israeli hostage who, on her release, said she had been \"held in the house of someone who worked for UNRWA\".\nIn his statement on Saturday, the UN secretary general said that Israel had made allegations against 12 UNRWA employees - nine had been sacked, one had died and the identity of the remaining two was being \"clarified\".\nMr Guterres said that he understood the concerns of the governments which have suspended funding. \"I was myself horrified by these accusations,\" he said, adding that \"the abhorrent alleged acts of these staff members must have consequences\".\nBut this should not mean that the many thousands who work for the agency should be penalised, the UN chief said.\nMr Guterres's statement followed a strongly-worded reaction by the head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, who called the decision to suspend funds \"shocking\" given the small number of staff facing the Israeli allegations.\nHe made it clear that UNRWA shared the list of its staff with Israel every year and had never received any concerns.\nSome countries have said they will continue their support for UNRWA. Norway's representative to the Palestinian Authority said the organisation has a \"crucial role\" in distributing aid, and emphasised the \"need to distinguish between what individuals may have done, and what UNRWA stands for\".\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz urged Mr Lazzarini to resign and said he aimed to stop UNRWA operating in Gaza after the war.\nThe 7 October attacks triggered Israel's massive retaliation on Hamas in Gaza - air strikes and shelling that have killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nUNRWA says it is struggling to get humanitarian aid to many of the estimated 1.7 million people - nearly three-quarters of the population - displaced by 12 weeks of fighting.\nMost recently, the fighting has centred on Khan Younis, where thousands of Palestinians displaced from the north had congregated.\nMany are now said to be moving further south, towards Rafah on the border with Egypt.\nMost of northern Gaza has been reduced to ruins as Israel pursues its campaign with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas.\nIsrael says it is destroying a network of tunnels - with estimates that 20-40% had been made unusable so far, according to US and Israeli officials quoted by US newspaper Wall Street Journal.",
    "The British Museum will put 10 items stolen from its collection on show later this month.\nThe Roman gems, to be featured in an exhibition Rediscovering Gems, include a cameo with a bust of Cupid from the 1st or 2nd Century AD.\nIn August, the museum announced up to 2,000 objects from its storerooms were missing, stolen or damaged.\nIt has recovered about 350 items to date.\nThe exhibition will explore the significance of classical gems through history.\nGeorge Osborne, who chairs the museum's Board of Trustees, said the new display was an example of openness and \"culture change\" at the British Museum.\n\"We promised we'd show the world the gems that were stolen and recovered - rather than hide them away,\" he added.\nThe museum has released pictures of two of those gems that have been chosen for display.\nBoth were returned by Dr Ittai Gradel, the dealer and collector who alerted the British museum to the thefts, and was originally brushed off.\nDr Gradel told the BBC he had been \"delighted\" to work with the museum on the recovery process.\n\"I am greatly pleased also to see that the whole culture of the institution appears to be changing to one of much greater openness and willingness to confront problems, than what I encountered in 2021,\" he said.\nDr Gradel has played a major role in the recovery process, tracking down and returning hundreds of gems he had bought in good faith.\nGems he has returned and will now go on display include an intaglio made from black glass with a bust of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom.\nThe new exhibition will also show more than 500 objects that were not caught up in the thefts. All the previously stolen items will be in their own display case and clearly labelled.\nI've seen many of the recovered gems during our investigation of the story for BBC News.\nThey are made of stone or glass, variously coloured and tiny - often barely the size of a thumbnail.\nThey are a fascinating window into the ancient Mediterranean world, where they were worn as jewellery, used as seals and collected as objects of beauty in their own right.\nThey are engraved or cast, perhaps with the face of an Emperor, a Roman or Greek God or another depiction from a classical story.\nTom Harrison, keeper of the department of Greece and Rome, says the exhibition is \"an interesting opportunity to cast some light on an underappreciated and very beautiful art form\".\nThese types of gems were hugely popular in the 18th Century. But they fell out of favour.\nThat may be one explanation for why they were left, unregistered, in the British Museum storeroom for more than a century.\nDr Gradel said gems had been \"overlooked\" but provided \"beautiful and fascinating insights into the tastes and mindsets of the ancient Greeks and Romans\".\n\"They are indeed deserving of far more study than they have received,\" he told the BBC. \"I look greatly forward to visiting the exhibition\".\nAfter an investigation discovered items had been stolen, a senior curator in the Greece and Rome department, Peter Higgs, was dismissed. He has previously denied any wrongdoing.\nThe police investigation is ongoing.\nFollowing the controversy, German art historian and British Museum director Hartwig Fischer resigned and former Victoria and Albert (V&A) Museum director Sir Mark Jones was appointed in the interim.\nRediscovering gems will be on display for free in room three at the British Museum from 15 February - 15 June 2024.",
    "The chief executive of High Street fashion chain H&M has quit after four years in the role as the firm revealed a slowdown in sales last year including over the Christmas season.\nDaniel Erver, who has worked for the Swedish chain for 18 years, will step in to Helena Helmersson's role.\nThe company's annual profits to November were also below market expectations.\nAnalysts say the group is lagging behind rivals Zara and Shein.\nShares in H&M dropped 10% following the announcement.\nMs Helmersson said the role had been \"very demanding at times\", and that she had \"mixed feelings\" about her departure.\n\"I am very proud of what we together have achieved during the last years when we have navigated through pandemic, and several geopolitical and macro-economic challenges,\" she said.\nThe Swedish firm has 3,874 stores in 77 countries, and is well-known for mid-value fashion, including accessories and sportswear. Some of its stores recently introduced homeware.\nIt has been a stalwart of UK High Streets since 1976, but it has faced fierce competition in recent years  by online fashion firms that turn styles around more quickly and at lower prices.\nH&M, like the rest of the fashion retail market, is facing a squeeze, said analyst Catherine Shuttleworth, with shoppers spending less on items that are seen as discretionary as they grapple with the cost-of-living crisis.\nInflation - the rate at which prices rise - reached near-record highs in 2023, but is slowing.\n\"For brands like H&M they find themselves fighting off competition at one end from major players like Inditex brands such as Zara, Pull and Bear and BERSHKA, as well as established retailers like Next, Primark and M&S and at the other end from fast growing online players - most notably, Shein,\" Ms Shuttleworth said.\nChinese-owned Shein's sales have been on a steep trajectory, after online sales surged during the pandemic. It is expanding in the British market in particular after its recent acquisition of British online retailer Missguided.\nRunning a business like this was \"no easy gig\" in the current climate Ms Shuttleworth said, given \"concerns around global uncertainty, shipping issues and the volatile nature of consumer spending\".\nOne concern on the horizon is disruption to supply chains, after Houthi rebels began attacking passing ships in one of the world's most popular trading route in the Red Sea.H&M revealed a pre-tax profit of 8.7 billion Swedish Krona (\u00c2\u00a3660m) for the year to November, below analysts' expectations. It said sales in the two months to January were 4% lower compared with last year.\nIn September, it admitted it needed to do more to improve consistency in clothes sizing, after it faced a backlash over its returns fee for online items. Earlier this year, it dropped and apologised for an advert in Australia about school uniforms, after it was accused of sexualising young children.\nH&M said it was \"deeply sorry\" for the offence caused by the advert and said it would \"look into how we present campaigns going forward\".",

    "The gap in our knowledge of great white sharks may have just been narrowed thanks to a YouTuber.\nAs far as experts are aware, the birth of a great white shark has never been witnessed, but Carlos Gauna may have captured the closest thing to that.\nCarlos has found fame on YouTube as TheMalibuArtist and has filmed incredible shots of sharks from above with his drone.\n\"You're basically viewing the sharks through a magnifying glass that they don't know is watching them,\" he says.\nHis YouTube videos, which have racked up tens of millions of views, often show great whites swimming concerningly close to humans.\n\"It does raise my heart rate sometimes. I've yet to see a shark get aggressive with or show aggressive behaviour around a human, but [it's] just human instinct,\" he says.\nOn a beach near Santa Barbara, California, last year, a sighting of a different nature got Carlos's pulse going.\nHe had already seen large sharks in the area when he stumbled across something he had never seen before.\n\"This little bitty white, almost albino-looking, white shark came up to the surface,\" he says.\nAs Carlos brought down his drone closer, more details of the shark emerged. It was white all over, but the white layer seemed to be flaking off.\nAt the time, Carlos was with shark researcher Phil Sternes, from the University of California, Riverside, who could not believe what he was seeing.\n\"I'm like, 'oh my goodness, this could be a newborn',\" he says.\n\"We're both falling out of our seats with excitement at that point. It was quite a moment.\"\nWhat got Phil particularly excited was the shape of the shark, whose fins were more rounded than usual. That is something you see in shark embryos and newborns.\nHe says the white layer could have been evidence the shark had just been born and still had a mucus-like substance on its body.\nJames Worthington, from the University of San Diego, helped the pair size the shark. Using the drone's distance from the sea surface and the crop factor, he worked out it was roughly 1.5m (4.9ft) long - about the right size for a newborn.\nTheir observation has been published in the journal Environmental Biology of Fishes.\nHowever, some marine biologists urge caution at jumping to the conclusion that it is definitely a newborn great white shark.\nDr Chris Lowe, from California State University's shark lab believes the finding is interesting, but there are other explanations for the white layer.\n\"Sure, this could be a newborn shark, or it could be a shark with a skin disease, or it could be a number of other things we haven't even thought of,\" he says.\n\"Unfortunately, it's a sample size of one. I think many scientists would agree that in order for us to consider this area of pupping location, we would need a lot more evidence.\"\nIn their report, Phil and Carlos acknowledge that the shark could have a skin condition, but Phil says: \"What's unique about this shark is it has a white layer.\n\"I looked in the literature extensively, we couldn't find anything that matches up to this. So it could be an unknown skin condition that's never been documented before, which is also unique.\"\nHowever, they believe that theory ignores other evidence from Carlos's video  - the aggressiveness of the flaking, the shape of the fins and the size of the shark.\nDrones have ushered in a revolution in shark filming, and not just for citizen scientists like Carlos. They are used by shark scientists to analyse the fish's behaviour, with some amazing observations.\n\"We just completed a two-year study where one of my grad students went out and flew drone surveys at 26 California beaches every month for two years,\" Dr Lowe says.\n\"What they found was that aggregation sites where we have juvenile white sharks day in day out, there were interactions with people every single day - multiple interactions.\"\nThat is exactly what Carlos finds. Great whites are much more common along California's beaches than you might think, and it is not uncommon for them to get close to humans.\nArmed with a drone and patience, he is hoping to one day become the first person to film one being born.",
    "In golf, there is a term called moving day, when players take risks to try and charge up the leader board.\nIt comes on the day before the final round, so players can position themselves to get over the finishing line first.\nMonday feels like moving day for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nIt is a day of high risk for Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, as he places his deal on the table.\nAfter months of negotiation, he is expected to reveal all to his MLAs and party executive .\nBut Monday will not be the final round - that will come later.\nThe meetings are about positioning the DUP to get over the finishing line when the moment arrives.\nA further price to be paid?\nBy close of play on Monday, Sir Jeffrey will hope to have the full endorsement of his party and he may then turn the focus on London and Brussels.\nDon't be surprised if there is a further price to be paid to get his party back into power sharing.\nThat may involve some upfront delivery of whatever has been promised in a deal.\nThat could see the government tabling legislation at Westminster which has been promised in the deal.\nTrust between the DUP and the government has eroded to the point where the party can no longer accept pledges from Downing Street.\nWith a party endorsement in his pocket, expect Sir Jeffrey to ramp up the pressure this week.\nHe will likely demand action from London and Brussels before the current legal window for Stormont to be restored closes on 8 February .\nIn a sense, using the government's deadline to put it under pressure.\nBut moving day for the DUP leader is also full of hazard.\nA paper published by his opponents seeks to dismantle any deal before it is published.\nThose behind it - Jim Allister, Kate Hoey, Ben Habib and Jamie Bryson - feel they know enough of the package to strip it apart.\nThey can't afford to wait for the deal to be published if they are to influence DUP executive members.\nThey've called on them to put the constitution before \"party loyalty\".\nIt feels like a last throw of the dice to block the DUP's path back to power-sharing.\nIf it works, Sir Jeffrey's leadership will hang in the balance.\nIf it fails, the DUP leader will feel turbocharged and will face down his critics both internally and externally with more fire.\nDUP officers are not due to meet on Monday, but that may come when and if the government responds to any fresh demands.\nThat could be the final move when it comes.",

    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Moscow of \"playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners\", after a deadly plane crash in western Russia.\nHe demanded an international inquiry after Wednesday's crash in the Belgorod region near Ukraine's border.\nRussia said there were no survivors after Kyiv had downed the Il-76 plane with 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, six Russian crew and three escorts.\nMoscow claimed the Ukrainians were being flown for a prisoner exchange.\nUkraine's military intelligence (GUR) said it had not been told to ensure safe airspace, as on previous occasions.\nThe GUR comments have been seen as a tacit acknowledgement that Ukraine shot the military transport plane down, although it stressed it had no reliable information about who was on board and warned the incident may have involved \"planned and deliberate actions by Russia\".\nIn his video address late on Wednesday, President Zelensky said it was \"obvious that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, with the feelings of their relatives and with the emotions of our society\".\nThe Ukrainian leader, who has cancelled a planned regional trip linked to his birthday on Thursday, stressed that \"all clear facts must be established\".\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the downing of the plane as a \"monstrous act\", according to Russian news agencies. He told reporters that if Mr Zelensky meant an international inquiry into \"the criminal actions of the Kyiv regime\", it was definitely needed.\nVideo shared on social media showed a plane going down followed by an explosion and a fireball near the village of Yablonovo, 70km (44 miles) to the north-east of the city of Belgorod, at about 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT).\nBelgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the plane crashed in a field near a residential area and that everyone on board had died.\nUkraine's general staff, quoted by the Ukrainska Pravda website, said initially that the plane was transporting missiles for Russia's S-300 air defence systems. It made no mention of PoWs.\nNone of the details surrounding those on board can be independently verified, but Ukraine's military intelligence said it was Russia's responsibility \"to ensure the safety of our defenders under the agreements that had been reached\".\nOn this occasion it said it had not been informed that the airspace had to be safeguarded \"at the defined time, which is something that had happened on numerous occasions before\".\n\"This can point to Russia's deliberate actions aimed at putting the lives and safety of the PoWs under threat,\" it added.\nUkraine and Russia have taken part in a number of prisoner swaps since the start of the war.\nUkrainian air force chief Mykola Oleschuk warned that throughout Wednesday Russian propaganda had tried to discredit Ukraine internationally. Ukraine had the right to destroy Russia's means of aerial attacks, he said.\nRussia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's second city Kharkiv with S-300 guided missiles from the Belgorod region in recent days.\nEight people were killed in a series of missiles strikes on Tuesday and another attack was launched overnight into Thursday.\nAhead of Wednesday's planned prisoner exchange, Ukrainian officials said the captured Russian military servicemen were \"delivered to the agreed location in time to be exchanged, and they were safe there\".\nRussia's defence ministry said the swap had been due to take place on Wednesday afternoon at a border checkpoint 100km (60 miles) to the west of Belgorod.\nThe ministry said a military transport plane had taken off from Chkalovsky air base north-east of Moscow en route to Belgorod, alleging that Ukraine's air force had fired two anti-aircraft missiles from the Lyptsi area south of the Ukrainian border.\nThe Ukrainian government body in charge of PoWs warned that Russia was \"actively carrying out special information operations against Ukraine, which are aimed at destabilising Ukrainian society\".\nDmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's parliamentary human rights commissioner, appealed to Ukrainians to trust only official sources: \"Do not be fooled by provocations. More detailed information will be provided later.\"\nAndrei Kartapolov, chairman of Russia's parliamentary defence committee, claimed there had been a second plane in the air transporting 80 Ukrainian prisoners, although that plane had then changed course.\n\"There can now be no talk of any other [prisoner] exchanges,\" Mr Kartapolov told Russian TV.\nThe biggest prisoner exchange since the start of the war took place earlier this month, when Ukraine freed 248 Russian prisoners of war and Russia released 230 people in a deal mediated by the United Arab Emirates .\nMore than 8,000 Ukrainians, both civilian and military, are still being held by Russia, according to Ukraine's Coordination HQ on the Treatment of PoWs, which says tens of thousands of others are still missing.\nBelgorod, which is located approximately 25 miles (40km) north of the border with Ukraine, h",
    "On the night he drowned, 14-year-old Obada Abd Rabbo was having doubts once again.\n\"I can't swim,\" he kept telling the men around him, as they shuffled down the wet slipway in the pitch dark, towards the icy waves.\nObada's older brother, Ayser, 24, clutched his hand.\nThis was the third time since leaving Syria nine months earlier that they had headed out to sea, and each time Obada had made the same anxious pleas - that he was scared, that he didn't know how to swim, that he was not sure about the journey.\nObada and Ayser were among five people who drowned, a few metres from the shore, on the coast of northern France that night - the first to die while trying to cross to the UK in a small boat in 2024, a fortnight into the new year.\nTo try to understand how a child could be put in this situation, the BBC reconstructed Obada's journey from Syria - using videos, messages and interviews with the brothers' relatives and others who accompanied them. Our aim was to explore the wrenching decisions involved at every stage.\nWe uncovered the extraordinary pressure that some children appear to be put under - by parents, relatives and smugglers alike. And we found a broader story about the motives and strategies of those seeking to reach the UK, and the impact of the deterrents which the British and other governments have introduced.\nOver the past months, the men now surrounding Obada on the slipway - nearly a dozen of them from the same neighbourhood in Daraa, a city in southern Syria - had been trying to toughen the boy up, telling him to be strong, to look after himself, to be a man. But it wasn't helping.\nIt was normal for men to attempt the trip, given that women would be considered more vulnerable, not least since they would transit through war-torn Libya. But there were also two mothers with teenage children attempting the crossing that night.\nBy now the inflatable boat was already in the water at the end of the slipway, and some people were clambering on board. In all there were more than 60 people in the crowd around them hoping for a place - far too many to fit safely. The smugglers had handed out motorcycle inner tubes as flotation devices with instructions not to inflate them until the boat was on its way to England.\nThe ebbing tide quickly began tugging at the boat, pulling it away from the slipway and out towards deeper water. It was early on Sunday 14 January and the wind had dropped enough for the smuggling gangs to attempt to launch their first crossings of 2024.\nSoon there was a frantic scramble as people rushed into the sea trying to get on the boat as it drifted from the shoreline. And in the growing chaos came a deepening sense of confusion.\nThis wasn't the typical wide beach that they had all seen along the northern French coast. Instead, the smugglers had brought them to the centre of Wimereux, a small resort town just north of the port of Boulogne, and to a slipway in the middle of a substantial sea wall, at high tide.\nThere was no shallow surf to wade through as they sought to board the retreating boat, but instead a steep drop from the sides of the slipway into deep water.\n\"It's not what we expected,\" said one of the survivors.\nIn his bedsit in west London, another of Obada's brothers, Nada, 25, kept glancing at his phone. It was 01:00 in London, 02:00 in France.\nA few hours earlier, Nada had called the whole group as they sat warming themselves around a fire at their makeshift camp under a canal bridge in Calais. They'd seemed confident about the journey ahead.\nEven Obada, wearing a dark knitted hat and blue scarf, had grinned, and held up two fingers to the camera in a victory sign. Their long, difficult journey was so nearly over.\nNada had made the same dangerous crossing two years earlier, ignoring his father, at home in Daraa, who had initially urged him to be patient, suggesting the war in Syria might soon end.\n\"But we've waited for 12 years, and it is not finished. There's no safety. There was no (other) way to ask for asylum,\" Nada remembers telling his father. Nada is a bearded, soft-spoken man, and tall, like all his brothers.\nNada had chosen to travel to England because an uncle had already made the journey almost a decade earlier and been granted permission to remain. Both men had come illegally because, Nada said, there was no alternative.\nAccording to Asylum Aid, a charity providing specialist legal advice to people seeking asylum, there is in practice no way for Syrian nationals to apply for asylum without travelling in person to the UK.\nThe vast majority try to cross the border illegally as there are no visas to apply for asylum. Family reunion - one of the few legal routes - is narrowly defined and visas are often refused, but some do succeed.\nA small number are also granted entry via resettlement schemes and Home Office statistics show that, in the year ending September 2023, about 325 Syrians were permitted to enter this way.

    "Sewage which overflowed onto the front garden of a home in Leicestershire has not been cleaned up, despite requests from the homeowner.\nDilip Patel, 72, said the front of his Iveshead Road home, in Shepshed, was flooded by human waste on Monday.\nHe said he reported it to Severn Trent, who sent out engineers, but remains of the waste still remain across his driveway.\nThe water company has apologised for the flooding.\nMr Patel said that he was alerted by neighbours that the sewage had pushed up a drain cover in front of his home and that waste was covering the front garden of the property.\nSewage also flooded his neighbour's driveway and is still flowing over a crossing point at the nearby Ashby Road West, he said.\nHe said the flood was \"pretty disgusting\".\n'Filthy and stinking'\n\"It was smelling and you could see all the tissues and all the faeces,\" he said.\n\"I rang Severn Trent and they said it would take four working days.\n\"It happened on Monday and still today all the muck is right on my front garden.\"\nMr Patel said his grandchildren have not been allowed to come to his house because of the waste.\n\"Their parents have not allowed them to come here because it is so filthy,\" he said.\n\"Even my children don't come at the moment because it is stinking.\n\"Four days living with this kind of smell is too much.\"\nThe 72-year-old said that he wants his property cleaned and for compensation to cover a \u00c2\u00a3180 bill he paid to a company who checked his drains for blockages.\nDaniel Borst, network operations Lead for Leicestershire at Severn Trent said: \"Any type of flooding can be distressing, and a team is already on site to investigate the cause of the issue, get it resolved as quickly as possible and undertake a thorough cleanse of the affected area.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "Israeli forces have killed three members of Palestinian armed groups in a hospital in the occupied West Bank.\nCCTV footage showed members of an undercover unit disguised as medics and other civilians making their way through a corridor with rifles raised.\nThe Israeli military said the men were hiding in the Jenin hospital, and that one was about to carry out an attack.\nThe Palestinian Authority's ministry of health accused Israel of carrying out a \"new massacre inside hospitals\".\nHamas, an armed Palestinian Islamist group which is fighting a war with Israel in Gaza triggered by its unprecedented attacks on Israel on 7 October, said the Israeli forces had \"executed three fighters\", including one of its members.\nAnother armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, said two of those killed were its members and were brothers. It added that one of them had been receiving treatment at the hospital.\nThe security camera video from Ibn Sina hospital shows several members of the Israeli undercover unit - men and women - hurrying through a corridor, training their weapons left and right. One can be seen taking a piece of clothing off an unidentified person who is kneeling down with his hands behind his head, then covering his head with it.\nThe footage shows two members of the unit carrying a folded wheelchair and a baby-carrier, apparently as props.\nImages from the room where the men are said to have been shot show blood-spattered floors and walls with a bloodied, blue pillow with a bullet hole in it on a bed.\n\"They executed the three men as they slept in the room,\" the hospital's director, Dr Naji Nazzal, told Reuters. \"They executed them in cold blood by firing bullets directly into their heads in the room where they were being treated.\"\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the guardian of the Geneva Conventions which codify international humanitarian law, has expressed concern over the raid.\n\"Under international humanitarian law, hospitals and medical patients should be respected and protected at all times\", the ICRC said, adding that it would raise the issue \"as part of its confidential dialogue with the concerned authorities\".\nTensions have soared in the West Bank since the 7 October attacks, with near daily Israeli arrest raids and clashes with Palestinians. Jenin, a militant stronghold, has been a focus of such raids for months.\nSince 7 October, Israeli forces have killed at least 357 Palestinians - militants, civilians and attackers - in the West Bank, while Israeli settlers have killed at least eight, according to the United Nations.\nPalestinians from the West Bank have killed at least 10 Israelis in attacks in the West Bank and Israel in the same period.\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the Hamas suspect who was killed had \"planned a raid attack inspired by the October 7th massacre\". On that date, waves of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel from Gaza, killed about 1,300 people - mainly civilians - and took about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.\nThe attack triggered Israel's military campaign in Gaza, with the declared aim of destroying Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 26,600 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in the Israeli offensive.\nThe official Palestinian news agency in the West Bank, Wafa, said the three Palestinians in the hospital had been \"assassinated\".\nAccording to its sources in the hospital, about 10 members of Israeli special forces dressed in civilian clothes went to the third floor, where they killed the men using weapons fitted with silencers.\nDr Naji Nazzal said one of the men, who PIJ identified as its member, had been receiving treatment at the hospital since 25 October for a spinal injury which had left him paralysed.",
    "The rumours about Imran Khan's third wife did not take long to start swirling.\nFor a start, Bushra Maneka - as she was known before her marriage to Pakistan's former cricket captain-turned-politician - was quite different to her two glamorous predecessors. While British socialite Jemima Goldsmith and journalist Reham Khan graced the covers of magazines and television screens, she stayed hidden behind a veil.\nIn fact, Khan told the Mail on Sunday proudly in 2018 that he \"did not catch a glimpse of my wife's face until after we were married\" - something that he said would have been \"unthinkable\" back in the 1980s, his heyday on the London nightclub circuit.\nIt was, he said, Bushra's intellect and character which drew him to her. But that was not what really got people talking - it was, instead, the mystical powers she was credited with.\nThe woman now known as Bushra Bibi was, in fact, a faith healer with a small following who respected her as a spiritual adviser.\nOn Wednesday the couple were both sentenced to jail and fined more than $2m each in a corruption case - news that had readers round the world googling her name to find out more about her.\nSome say Bushra Bibi's attached to the Sufi tradition, but that is disputed by others. Often described as Islamic mysticism, Sufism - which her husband says he has been interested in for more than three decades - emphasises the inner search for God and the renunciation of worldly matters.\nIt's a far cry from his cricketing years when he developed a reputation as a playboy before settling down to a society marriage that was never far from the limelight.\nIn 1995, at the age of 43, he married the 21-year-old British heiress, Jemima Goldsmith - the daughter of one of the world's richest men at the time. The marriage lasted nine years and produced two sons.\nA second marriage in 2015, to journalist and former BBC weather presenter Reham Khan, lasted less than a year. She alleges she was bullied by his supporters and wrote a tell-all memoir.\nBy contrast, Imran Khan's 2018 marriage to Bushra Bibi was a low-profile ceremony. Observers say the match plays well with his public shows of devotion to Islam.\nIt's rumoured Khan turned to the mother-of-five for advice after they met at a 13th-Century Sufi shrine. At the time she was still married to her first husband.\nBushra Bibi, it was whispered, then saw in a dream that the only way Khan would become prime minister was if they got married. And so, the couple wed - and six months later Khan became Pakistan's prime minister.\nBushra Bibi, who is reportedly now in her 40s, was quick to rubbish the story in her only television interview to date, in October 2018.\nShe did, however, assure the interviewer that Pakistan would soon improve under Imran Khan's leadership.\nThat did not come to pass: during his tenure, the economy collapsed, the cost of living soared, many of his political opponents were jailed, media freedoms were curbed and human rights violations and attacks against journalists increased.\nAs a politician, Imran Khan built his success by publicly upholding liberalism, while at the same time appealing to Islamic values and anti-West sentiment. He was also said to be close to Pakistan's military, with whom he subsequently fell out of favour.\nFour years into his tenure, Khan's political career began unravelling. In 2022 he was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no confidence and the following year he was arrested and jailed as court cases piled up against him.\nNow, Pakistan's former first lady is also jailed, serving a 14-year sentence after they were both convicted of illegally profiting from state gifts while he was in office.\nShe has other legal problems too.\nHer former husband, to whom she was married for 28 years before their divorce in 2017, is pursuing her through the courts.\nKhawar Maneka - a civil servant and son of a well-known politician - filed a complaint alleging \"fraudulent marriage and fornication\" in November, according to Pakistan's Dawn newspaper. Days before, he had told Pakistan's GeoNews that he had come forward because he was \"exhausted from holding it in\".\nThe courts threw out the fornication charge but the fraudulent marriage case has been allowed to proceed.\nUnder Muslim family law, women are prohibited from remarrying for a few months after their husband dies or they are divorced. It is alleged that Bushra Bibi married Imran Khan before the completion of the stipulated time following her divorce from Khawar Maneka.\nBushra Bibi's precise role in the state gifts case - in which sentencing came just over a week before national elections in which her husband is banned from participating - is unclear.\nShe and her husband were accused of illegally selling gifts - including perfumes, dinner sets and diamond jewellery - through their aides in Dubai during Khan's time in office. According to Reuters news agency, these gifts were worth more than 140m rupees ($501,000; \u00c2\u00a3395,000).\nKhan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ",
    "A metal detectorist said discovering a 2,000-year-old snake head silver bracelet was \"a special moment\".\nTrain driver Phil Craddock, 52, made the early Roman find on the Courteenhall Estate, near Northampton.\nIt is one of several objects unearthed by detectorists which are part of a touring exhibition of four Northamptonshire libraries.\nAnother rare find joining the display is an Iron Age socketed axe head, also discovered on Courteenhall land.\nThe bracelet, which has never been on display before, was acquired by Northampton Museum and Art Gallery after it was declared treasure.\nMr Craddock said: \"Finding the silver snake head bracelet was a special moment.\n\"When you wipe away the soil and realise that you've found something that hasn't been seen for thousands of years, it's a fantastic feeling.\"\nIt dates to between 50 and 200 AD and may have been worn for protection against evil.\nThe Iron Age axe head was found by detectorist Phil Douglas, one of fewer than 30 such iron axes found in Britain.\nIt was cast in the same way as bronze, possibly as an experiment in how newly-discovered iron could be used.\n\"It's great that some of the historic finds that metal detectorists have made on the estate are now on view for free to the public,\" said Johnny Wake, Courteenhall's managing partner.\nMany of the exhibition's artefacts were acquired through the British Museum's Portable Antiquities Scheme .\nThose classified as treasure - such as the bracelet - must be reported to county finds liaison officers .\nHistory Curator Jill Birrell said: \"This is a wonderful opportunity for people to visit their local library to see traces of life in Northamptonshire from hundreds and thousands of years ago.\"\nThe exhibition is split into Bronze Age, Roman, medieval, and post-medieval displays.\nThey will be rotated through Brackley, Towcester, Daventry, and Northampton's Weston Favell libraries until April.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch has said the UK will retain the ability to diverge from EU rules.\nIt comes after a report that the government will voluntarily limit divergence as part of a deal aimed at restoring devolution in NI.\nSuch a move would help minimise post-Brexit trade barriers between NI and the rest of the UK.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Ms Badenoch did not deny that such a policy was being considered.\nNorthern Ireland has remained inside inside the EU's single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left.\nThat means there is free-flowing trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland .\nHowever, new checks and controls are required on some goods coming from Great Britain - what is known as the Irish Sea border.\nAt the point Great Britain left the single market it had the same rules as the EU but over time divergence is likely to occur as the two sides update their rules.\nGrowing divergence could potentially increase the level of controls on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and require businesses to make changes to their processes.\nThe Daily Telegraph has reported that the UK government is offering to introduce a new requirement that all new laws are \"screened\" to ensure they will not create extra trade barriers.\nThe newspaper said it would mean all legislation would have to accompanied by a ministerial statement confirming it did not have a \"significant adverse impact\" on internal UK trade.\nThe offer could form part of a package aimed at getting the DUP to end its boycott of devolved government over the impact of the sea border.\nIn the Commons, the former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers asked Ms Badenoch if she was \"in a position to deny a report in the Telegraph today that the government has pledged to introduce a requirement that all future regulatory law change will be screened to ensure that they don't create extra trade barriers in the Irish Sea?\"\nMs Badenoch said she could not comment on the NI political process as she was not involved in it.\nShe added: \"What I will say is that we retain the ability to diverge, that is clear, and I do agree with her that if we are really to seize the benefits of Brexit we need to find that comparative advantage in our regulations with the EU, otherwise there would be no point.\"",

    "An Iran-backed militia group has said it was responsible for a drone strike at a US military base in Jordan that killed three American troops.\nAt least 34 other service members were injured in the attack at the base, known as Tower 22. The White House blamed Iran and vowed a \"very consequential response\".\nBut Iran called the accusation \"baseless\" and said it was \"not involved in the decision-making of resistance groups\".\nUS officials have sought for weeks to prevent high tensions on several fronts in the region from boiling over into a wider war.\nBut Sunday marked the first time US soldiers had been killed by enemy fire in the region since Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.\nWhere is the Tower 22 military base?\nThe attack targeted a US military base known as Tower 22 in north-eastern Jordan, near the Syrian border.\nA defence official told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the enemy drone came in \"very low and very slow\" at the same time that an American drone was returning to the base from a mission.\nThe auto-response features of the base's air defence system were turned off so as not to shoot down the US drone, the official said.\nAs a result, there was little to no warning for troops stationed at Tower 22, who were reportedly still in their sleeping quarters when the drone arrived.\nThere are about 350 US forces stationed at the base, conducting key functions including supporting the coalition to defeat Islamic State, according to US Central Command (CentCom).\nAmong those injured, eight service members were medically evacuated from Jordan to receive higher-level care, but they are in stable condition, CentCom said.\nWhy are there US bases in the Middle East?\nThe base which was hit in a deadly drone attack in a north-west corner of Jordan is one of more than a dozen where US military personnel operate across Iraq, Jordan and Syria.\nIn recent months, these bases - ranging in size from a military outpost such as Tower 22, which was hit in Jordan, to al-Asad air base in western Iraq - have been attacked by militias trained, funded and equipped by Iran.\nThere are about 3,000 US troops based in Jordan, a key US ally, and 2,500 in Iraq - there at the invitation of the Iraqi government as part of a US-led coalition to prevent a resurgence of the jihadist Islamic State group, which still has a presence there after being routed in 2017.\nThere are also about 900 US personnel in Syria, officially there to support its anti-IS ally the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria's semi-autonomous north-east region. The Syria government opposes the US presence in its country, calling it an occupation.\nThe US also maintains many more bases further afield across the Middle East, including three major air bases in the Gulf and a port in Bahrain which serves as the headquarters of the US Naval Forces Central Command and the US Fifth Fleet.\nWhat is the Islamic Resistance in Iraq?\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it was responsible for the attack in a statement posted to Telegram on Sunday.\nIt said it targeted three US bases in Syria and Jordan - Shaddadi, Rukban and Tanf - as well as an Israeli oil facility in the Mediterranean.\nThe group emerged in late 2023, right after the beginning of Israel's bombardment in Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October.\nIt consists of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq and has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.\n\"Islamic Resistance in Iraq\" is believed to be an umbrella term for various Shia militia groups such as Kataib Hezbollah, Nujaba and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, that have a long history of targeting US bases in Iraq and Syria.\nTehran refers to its networks of proxies and allied groups in the region as the \"Axis of Resistance\", a kind of forward defence against its enemies.\nThe point of creating these ghost groups is to make it difficult for Washington to pin the attacks on a specific culprit.\nHow will the US respond?\nPresident Joe Biden said the \"despicable and wholly unjust\" attacks on Sunday had been carried out by \"radical Iran-backed militant groups\".\nHe also vowed the US \"will hold all those responsible to account at a time and manner of our choosing\".\nAll eyes are now on the White House, which is under pressure to respond forcefully to the attack, with some lawmakers and current and former officials calling for strikes against Iranian targets.\nMr Biden's dilemma is how to retaliate, who to hit and where to hit. The big question is whether the US can deter attacks by hitting back hard or whether it will add fuel to a growing fire in the region.\nMick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East, told the BBC he believes that the US should respond with \"more force than we have used to date\".\n\"It's been clear that the US does not want this war in Gaza to expand in the region. It's also been clear that Iran does want it to expand,\" he said. \"The only thing they understand is force. It's time to use ",

    "He took a tiny menagerie and turned it into one of Nigeria's most popular attractions, drawing 250,000 visitors a year at its peak in the 1970s. Now, Bob Golding - who died in 2022 - has been remembered fondly by his widow, Peaches Golding, Lord Lieutenant of Bristol.\n\"On a Sunday morning you would see the Nigerian people dressed in their Sunday fineries,\" Mrs Golding recalled.\n\"They were going to Bob's zoo and they were captivated by the snakes, the gorillas, the chimpanzees, the lions, the hyenas.\n\"It had the largest attendance numbers of any public amenity in all of Africa at that time. Isn't that amazing?\"\nMr Golding's fascination with animals started as a toddler when his grandmother would coax snails out of the garden wall for him to look at.\nOne day she was shocked to find a snake, which Mr Golding had smuggled into the house, coiled around her oven hob.\nBorn in Bristol, he spent school holidays working at Bristol Zoo.\nHis affinity with animals was soon noticed by famous naturalist, Gerald Durrell, who took him on an animal-collecting trip to Cameroon in 1957, when Mr Golding was just 19.\nHe was nicknamed 'Keep 'em alive Bob' due to his talent for keeping small animals and birds alive. Mr Golding also featured in Durrell's book Zoo in my Luggage which charted their discoveries during the six-month expedition.\nIn 1963, Mr Golding was appointed curator of a small collection of animals used to support teaching and research in the Department of Zoology at the University of Ibadan in south west Nigeria.\nIt became a fully-fledged zoo in 1974, welcoming visitors from far and wide.\nIt was in fact so popular that Mr Golding presented a TV series in which he introduced Nigerian school children to his African kingdom.\nMrs Golding remembers first meeting the man who would become her husband in 1976.\nSpeaking to BBC World Service for its Witness History series , she said: \"Bob threw great parties. He had the right music, the right atmosphere, food, drink. People loved his parties.\n\"One night he was having a party and up came the blue lights from the police. Of course everyone at the party was thinking, what on earth is going on here?\n\"And the police said 'we hear you've got a snake here, we've come to see it being fed'.\n\"The zoo was just the place to go on a Sunday. And that zoo would be absolutely full of people.\"\nMrs Golding was brought up in North Carolina on the east coast of the United States.\nShe said the couple were drawn together by a shared love of reptiles.\n\"After university, I decided to go to West Africa. Lo and behold, I met Bob.\n\"I had just gone to see a new exhibit of the most amazing snakes, Burmese pythons.\n\"He came right over and we started talking about snakes because I used to have snakes as well,\" she said.\nBut not everyone at the zoo gave her such a warm welcome.\n\"Two traders had killed the mothers of these tiny, tiny baby gorillas so the government asked Bob to look after and rear these animals.\n\"Bob took me into the enclosure very early on in our relationship and he called Aruna, the male gorilla, and said to him, 'hold your hand out' and Aruna very reluctantly held his hand out like Bob had taught him to do.\n\"After that occasion I noticed that every time I went to have a look at the gorillas, the minute I would turn away, Aruna would fling his hand out and a whole handful of gorilla poo would soil my shirt, my trousers, absolutely everything.\n\"You wouldn't believe it; he was a good shot.\"\nThe couple left Nigeria for the UK in 1979 - accompanied by a royal python they shared their home with for more than 25 years.\nThe University of Ibadan Zoological Gardens remain open to this day, primarily for the conservation of endangered species, as well as research.\nMr Golding never stopped protecting animals.\nUntil his retirement, Mr Golding directed zoos across the UK including Chessington Zoo, Windsor Safari Park and the Cotswold Wildlife Park.\nHe also advised the RSPCA on the first purpose-built wildlife hospital in Europe at East Winch in Norfolk, which opened in 1991.\nMrs Golding is now His Majesty's Lord Lieutenant of Bristol , the city where her husband was born and grew up.\nOccasionally she still runs into people who have visited the West African zoo and remind her how much it means to Nigerians.\n\"I was getting into a taxi with with our son in London and he asked if he had ever been to the zoo at the University of Ibadan?\n\"He said yes and I said it was my husband who developed that zoo.\n\"Wow. He talked about the lions. He talked about the gorillas. He talked about the snakes. He talked about absolutely everything.\n\"So there is an age of people who remember very fondly those Sundays, looking at those animals and marvelling at the wonderful wildlife of West Africa,\" she said.\nMr Golding died in 2022 at the age of 84.\nOne of his two daughters, Samantha Golding, said after his death: \"In later years he continued to get joyful letters from people who had visited the zoo - many called it the 'Gard",
    "The number of people in hospital with flu and norovirus has hit a new high for this winter in England.\nLatest NHS figures show 2,226 beds were taken up by flu patients each day last week, up 70% in a month.\nBut the number in hospital with Covid dipped slightly, and surveillance from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) showed rates were \"broadly stable\".\nThe NHS said the data showed it was still \"in the thick of a challenging winter\".\n\"Last week was evidence of why the NHS needed to grow its core bed numbers,\" said Prof Julian Redhead, NHS England's clinical director for urgent and emergency care.\nThe NHS said this month that it had met its target to increase the number of core hospital beds in England by 5,000 to 99,864.\nBut the latest data shows 96% of adult beds were still full last week, above the 85% level seen as safe by the World Health Organization.\nNHS performance figures also showed that 34% of hospital patients in England arriving by ambulance in the week to 18 January had to wait more than 30 minutes to be handed over to A&E doctors.\nThat was up from 32% in the previous week, and the joint highest rate so far this winter.\nIt comes as a number of hospitals, including Shrewsbury , Winchester and Stoke have declared critical incidents recently because of \"sustained pressure\" on services, allowing them to request assistance from neighbouring NHS trusts.\nFlu and norovirus surge\nThe latest figures show the winter flu season appears to have come later this year with the number needing hospital treatment continuing to rise.\nCommon symptoms in adults include a sudden high temperature, aches, a dry cough and a sore throat. Some people also feel sick and report diarrhoea or stomach pain.\nThe symptoms are similar in children, but they can also suffer from ear pain and appear less active.\nAn average of 2,226 patients were in hospital each day last week with flu, including 84 in critical care beds, according to NHS England.\nThe total is up 41% from 1,582 the previous week and up 70% from the start of the year.\nThe NHS is urging those eligible for a free flu jab this winter, including all those over 65 years old, to continue to come forward.\nAnother 688 hospital beds in England were filled last week by people with norovirus-like symptoms such as diarrhoea and sickness.\nThe virus - known as the winter vomiting bug - spreads easily through contaminated surfaces or contact with an infected person.\nCovid hospitalisations dip slightly\nThe number of people in hospital with Covid in England declined slightly, with an average of 3,701 beds occupied over the past week in large NHS trusts.\nOf that number, just over a quarter - or 1,013 - were being treated \"primarily\" for the virus, with the majority admitted to hospital for another health problem.\nA separate study from researchers at UKSHA suggested that the number of people testing positive for Covid in the community as a whole remained steady in the two weeks to 24 January.\nAnalysis of lateral flow tests indicated that about 2% - or one in every 50 people - would have tested positive for the virus in England and Scotland, compared to 2.3% in its previous report.",
    "Rishi Sunak is disappointed train operators have not used a new law aimed at enforcing minimum service levels during strikes this week, No 10 said.\nLast year, the government changed the rules in order to allow train companies to require enough people to work during strikes to run 40% of normal services.\nHowever, this power will not be used during the upcoming industrial action by trade union Aslef.\nNo 10 said it was up to the operators \"to effectively manage their services\".\n\"We have been as clear as possible that they should be ready to use all powers available to them to reduce the impact of rail strikes on passengers.\"\nUnions have strongly opposed the introduction of minimum service levels and Aslef has warned it would respond to any enforcement with more strikes.\nThe trade union's general secretary Mick Whelan described the rules as \"forced labour\" and \"a stain on our society\".\nHe told the BBC he was not surprised train operators had not used their new powers saying \"the companies didn't want to do it... nobody knows if it can be done safely.\"\nAslef had announced five strike days starting from 5 February in response to LNER exploring the introduction of minimum service levels. However those extra strike days were cancelled when the operator rowed back on its threat.\nAn industry source told the BBC that implementing minimum service levels is tricky as it means co-ordinating a 40% timetable with all the other operators in a short space of time.\nThat didn't mean minimum service levels would never be used, but not this time, the source said.\nConservative MP Caroline Nokes has expressed concern about the new law. Speaking to Politics Live she said: \"The stark reality is that the legislation clearly isn't working, it isn't delivering what Grant Shapps promised in enabling people to get to work.\n\"I don't know whether that means going back to the drawing board, whether it means amendments, but it does seem to be farcical that we were expecting this to work. It hasn't.\"\nAsked if the prime minister was disappointed that train operators had not implemented minimum service levels, Downing Street said: \"Yes, it's something that we and the public expect them to use.\n\"We've been repeatedly been clear that this legislation is available for train operators to use.\n\"It's something the rail operators called for many months ago and the public would rightly expect them to be used if strike action is taking place.\"\nThe Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill was introduced last year amid a wave of industrial action, as workers called for pay to keep pace with the rising cost of living.\nThe bill allowed ministers to set minimum service levels for rail, health, fire and education services, as well as border security and nuclear decommissioning.\nIn December, the government announced that the equivalent of 40% of normal timetables should operate during strike action, allowing priority routes to stay open.\nLabour has said it would repeal the legislation if it wins the next election.\nThe industrial action will run from Monday 29 until Tuesday 6 February with Aslef members refusing to work overtime between those days.\nThis may cause some cancellations and delays, but the more severe disruption will take place on strike days between Tuesday 30 January and Monday 5 February.\nUnlike Aslef, the RMT union is not taking part in the industrial action.\nLast November their members, including guards and ticket office staff, voted to accept a pay offer including a backdate pay rise of 5% for 2022-23 as well as job security guarantees.\nHowever, talks with the RMT over future pay deals and working practices are continuing.",

The agents were unable to find any official record of him on the Scandinavian Airlines flight or any other flight.\nHe was also unable to provide a visa, a passport, or any other travel document needed to enter the US. After searching his bag, officials found both Russian and Israeli ID cards that belonged to him.\nOfficials accused him of giving \"false and misleading information about his travel to the United States\", including initially telling border agents that he had forgotten his passport on the plane.\nOchigava told border agents that he \"might have had a plane ticket \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but was not sure\", according to his indictment.\nHe also said he had no memory of how he got on the flight, claiming he had not slept for three days.\nOchigava will be formally sentenced on 5 February.",

The ship was now sailing towards a safe harbour, the company said.\nThe US Central Command (Centcom) said there were no casualties on the tanker, which was made up of 22 Indian and 1 Bangladeshi crew members.\nIt is the latest attack on commercial shipping by the Houthis in and around the Red Sea. The group says it is targeting vessels in the region in support of Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel is fighting Hamas.\nIn a statement, a Houthi spokesperson claimed the Marlin Luanda was a British ship and was targeted in response to \"American-British aggression against our country\".\nThe UK government said attacks on commercial shipping are \"completely unacceptable\" and that Britain and its allies \"reserve the right to respond appropriately\".\nThe US Central Command said \"these unlawful actions have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza\".\n\"Neither the vessel nor its crew have any affiliation to Israel. The Houthis have fired indiscriminately into the Red Sea, targeting vessels impacting over 40 countries around the world,\" Centcom said in a statement.\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said the incident happened 60 nautical miles south-east of Aden.\nIt warned other vessels to transit with caution and report any suspicious activity.\nLater, Centcom said its forces had conducted a strike at 03:45 local time (00:45 GMT) on Saturday \"against a Houthi anti-ship missile aimed into the Red Sea and which was prepared to launch\". They \"destroyed the missile in self-defence\", Centcom said.\nSince November, the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.",

Previously, people had to meet more stringent criteria to be tested, meaning fewer had qualified for the programme.\nThe tests can be ordered online and completed at home, by taking a sample of saliva and sending it off to a laboratory.\nEveryone carries BRCA genes, which repair DNA damage and usually help to protect against cancer.\nHowever, it is estimated that a fault in one of those genes affects about one in every 400 people, with Jewish people six times more likely to be affected.\nThere is a 50% chance of someone who has a faulty BRCA gene passing it on to any children.\nHowever, having an altered BRCA gene does not mean a person will definitely develop cancer.\nPeter Johnson, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said the testing programme had \"the potential to save lives\".\n\"We know it can be daunting finding out whether or not you have an altered BRCA gene, and some people may feel they'd rather not know - but finding out early means people can get the support they need from the NHS,\" Mr Johnson said.\n'Not worth the risk'\nKatie Kaye, a Jewish mother-of-two who is BRCA positive, said she was \"thrilled\" about the rollout, highlighting how screening had previously been difficult for some to access.\nMs Kaye, from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, said she was tested after her mother died of breast cancer aged 35.\n\"I decided it was the best option. That way I could decide what I wanted to do,\" she said\n\"I have young kids, and the thought of not being around for them is not an option.\"\nMs Kaye plans to have a preventative double mastectomy this summer, followed by surgery to remove her ovaries next year.\n\"It will be nice not to have it hanging over me,\" she said.\nShe said she could understand why people might avoid being tested, but added, \"it's silly to bury your head in the sand - it's not worth the risk\".\nDuring a pilot phase of the programme, 5,000 people of with Jewish ancestry came forward for testing, 80 of whom were found to have defective BRCA genes.\nThe aim of the national rollout is to test 30,000 people over the next two years.\nNicole Gordon, chief executive officer of the charity Jnetics - which has worked with the NHS on the rollout - described the programme as \"a huge opportunity to gain the knowledge that will help mitigate against the impact of hereditary cancer, and ultimately save lives\".\n\"We want to ensure that this programme reaches as many people as possible,\" said Lisa Steele, chief executive of Chai Cancer Care, who also worked alongside the NHS on the testing programme.\nCancer Research UK estimates 5-10% of all diagnosed cancers are linked to an inherited faulty gene, but that figure is not specific to BRCA genes.\nNHS England said it \"continues to roll out innovations to catch cancers early - when treatments are more likely to be successful\".",

    "\"Horror stories\" that left a post office unable to recruit staff have forced it to close.\nNefyn post office, in Gwynedd, closed its doors last September after people were \"frightened off\" by the Horizon system.\nThe scandal has been highlighted by ITV's hit drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, which aired this month.\nThe Post Office said it wanted to see justice for all those who were wronged during the scandal.\nA note on Nefyn post office's counter, put up by the Spar Madryn Shop, in which was located, said the counter would be shut permanently.\nIt read: \"Due to the demands of the Horizon system coupled with the recent horror stories we are finding it increasingly difficult to secure members of staff willing and able to man the counter.\"\nMadryn Shop's supervisor, Nicola Wood, said there was some initial interest but following the drama which starred Toby Jones as Alan Bates from Llandudno, all interest disappeared.\nHer sister, Lorraine Williams, from Anglesey, was one of the former sub-postmasters wrongly convicted of false accounting.\nMs Wood said: \"I don't like the Post Office anyway because of what my sister has gone through. I knew what was going on, but many didn't.\n\"It's a big responsibility, and especially now, knowing that the Horizon system is faulty, or has been faulty, they just don't want to work on it.\"\nMP Liz Saville-Roberts said the scandal and Post Office business practices were hurting communities.\n\"The post office in Nefyn closed partly because staff no longer trust the computer systems, which I bet is happening in countless communities,\" she said.\nGwynedd councillor Anwen Davies said: \"It's terrible that there isn't a post office in Nefyn anymore.\"\nThe Post Office said the Tudweiliog office is located nearby and can be reached by public transport.\n\"The recent ITV drama movingly depicted a shameful period in Post Office's history,\" it said.\n\"Nevertheless, we welcome it and its effect in encouraging victims of the Horizon IT scandal to come forward, and in precipitating justice for all those who have been wronged.\"",

    "Police in Thailand have arrested a woman whose pet lion was pictured going on a joyride in the streets of Pattaya.\nA video that has now gone viral shows the chained lion cub seated in the back of a white, open-top Bentley.\nThe lion was being driven about by a Sri Lankan man who has since left the country, and is believed to be a friend of the woman, Sawangjit Kosoongnern.\nWhile it is not illegal to own a lion in Thailand, it needs to be officially registered.\nAuthorities in Thailand said Ms Sawangjit claimed to have bought the animal from a Thai man in Nakhon Pathom province, who successfully facilitated its delivery to Pattaya.\nHowever he failed to have his facility checked by officials before doing so, which made both the transfer and ownership of the animal illegal.\nShe is therefore facing charges of possessing a controlled wild animal without permission, which carries a penalty of a year's imprisonment and a fine of up to 100,000 baht ($2,800; \u00c2\u00a32,200).\nPolice were also reportedly looking to charge the Sri Lankan man, who had kept the lion in his rented pool villa, but were unable to as he is no longer in Thailand. He was due to be charged with bringing a controlled wild animal into public places, which carries jail time of up to six months and a fine of 50,000 baht.\nThe man who sold the lion to Ms Sawangjit will also face charges of moving an animal without permission.\nOfficials say there are currently 224 lions in Thailand that are legally owned.",

    "Nicola Sturgeon has, predictably, been a less prominent fixture in Scottish politics since she stood down as first minister.\nBut Wednesday's marathon evidence session was a reminder that she took centre stage during one of the bleakest periods in living memory.\nThe former first minister is largely at home in this kind of forum.\nShe is no stranger to being quizzed and scrutinised, to having her comments and decisions pored over.\nAnd even her most ardent political opponents will concede that she's a talented communicator. This forum was all about communication.\nFor much of this full-day session Ms Sturgeon was on sure ground, defending her pandemic approach.\nBut there were awkward areas that she had to address.\nFirst up - WhatsApps.\nMs Sturgeon confirmed her messages from the pandemic had not been \"retained\".\nAfter a slightly pedantic exchange about wording, she conceded this meant she had deleted them.\nWe got a broadly similar explanation for her approach as we've had from other ministers and officials.\nScottish government guidance advised that messages should be regularly deleted from phones once significant information had been saved centrally.\nCritics are swift to point out this policy means ministers essentially mark their own homework: they decide what's relevant (and therefore saved) and what disappears forever.\nThe former first minister insists she did not do a lot of messaging on her phone during the pandemic.\nBut one exchange that the inquiry did get hold of showed her discussing hospitality rules with a key advisor. To most, it would have looked like decisions - or at the very least important discussions - were happening on the app.\nThe former first minister stressed that those discussions were taking place in tandem in more formal settings.\nThis was one of the more difficult areas for Ms Sturgeon, and she did have to concede that she had made public statements that suggested there would be more access to her WhatsApps than proved, ultimately, to be the case.\nThe inquiry felt like it slightly went around in circles on this point.\nThe former first minister believes all relevant information has been made available to the inquiry.\nOthers, including some bereaved families, feel they are not getting the full picture.\nThese two groups will probably never see eye to eye on this.\nWhatsApps aside, the first minister's leadership style was under the microscope.\nSome believe Ms Sturgeon had a tendency to make the big calls herself, or with a very limited group of political allies.\nBut the former first minister stressed that she never wanted \"carte blanche\", and while she preferred to keep meetings small she expected input from her fellow ministers.\nIt is worth remembering that while the SNP may have a fair bit of infighting going on at the moment, that wasn't the case for the vast majority of Ms Sturgeon's time leading the party.\nAnd it is perhaps not hugely surprising that ministers were often happy to delegate decision making to a leader who was proving popular during the pandemic - and had proven herself to be a consistent election winner.\nThere were moments today where Ms Sturgeon got emotional. She told the inquiry a part of her wishes she hadn't been first minister during the pandemic.\nIt was a reminder that having to make decisions that hugely impact on people's lives can weigh heavy on elected officials.\nThis echoed some of Ms Sturgeon's leadership style that came out during the pandemic.\nIn those months she occasionally made clear that hers was a high pressure job, and that the restrictions governing daily life affected her too.\nEmotional toll\nBut it seemed like we saw more of the emotional toll today than we had ever seen before.\nIt was evident when she spoke about her regret over not locking down earlier, and the loss of life in care homes.\nThough it appeared there were some parts of this session that Ms Sturgeon found hard to reflect on, there were plenty of areas that seemed to be comfortable ground.\nHer government's approach to some of the operational decisions during Covid (e.g. testing, quarantines and lockdowns) has faced criticism.\nBut it was obvious that the former SNP leader was across the detail and content to defend her decisions.\nShe insisted that she had not tried to politicise the pandemic. Indeed, she pointed out that her government paused plans for a second independence referendum.\nMs Sturgeon was on slightly shakier ground trying to explain why cabinet minutes from June 2020 said that consideration should be given to restarting work on independence.\nThough, as she pointed out, work on Brexit continued as the pandemic raged across the UK and Europe.\nAnd talking of Brexit, it's clear that there was no love lost between Ms Sturgeon and the politician who made that constitutional change happen - Boris Johnson.\nThe former first minister has made it obvious that she believes Mr Johnson was not the right leader for a pandemic, and that she found him difficult to work with.\nGiven that we h",

The family believes the search was too limited in scope.\nHosein told the family he \"hasn't slept for 50 years\" and lives in a \"terrible way\" with people judging him.\nMr Dyer said: \"I don't forgive him because I can't forgive him, but I can thank him for deciding to do the right thing.\nHe said he \"started to shed a tear or two\" as he watched his mother converse with his grandmother's killer and was impressed by his mother's bravery.\n\"I mean, she is his only link with what he did and he always felt guilty and what he was involved in was awful and he knew it,\" said Mr Dyer.\nHe said while he wishes officers from The Met had come with them he was hopeful the force would be \"very keen to get on with this job\" after seeing recordings of the meeting and the information held.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "\"The only man I was ever afraid of was a woman named Griselda Blanco.\" This is what infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar allegedly once said about the person who created one of the most profitable cartels in history.\nA woman who had people murdered because \"she didn't like the way they looked at her\", Blanco was a ruthless criminal mastermind whose name was one of the most feared in 1970s and 80s Miami.\nNow the notorious drug lord has had a Hollywood makeover as Modern Family's Sof\u00c3\u00ada Vergara joins forces with the team behind crime drama Narcos to play the leader of the criminal underworld.\nFilled with high-stake dramatic shoot-outs and neon nouveau riche glamour, the six-part series premiered on Netflix on Thursday. Griselda presents the notorious criminal as a hard done by yet savvy and ambitious woman.\nBut the true story of the woman, dubbed the \"cocaine godmother\" and responsible for the murder of her three husbands, is far murkier.\nBorn in Colombia in 1943, Blanco was involved in criminal activity from the age of 11, allegedly shooting dead a wealthy boy after she kidnapped him and his parents refused to pay a ransom.\nIn 1964, aged 21, she illegally immigrated to New York with her three children and husband and began selling marijuana.\n\"It is important to remember who Griselda was early on in her life. She was an immigrant raising three kids completely alone. She had nothing, no education or tools to survive,\" Vergara, who was also born in Colombia, told the BBC.\nShowrunner Eric Newman said he wanted to \"humanise the complex character\" of Griselda Blanco as \"every person has an explanation, not an excuse, but an explanation\" and as a \"single mother fleeing an abusive relationship, she can be relatable at times\".\n\"She is a woman in a man's world, she works ten times harder to prove herself and uses her wit and intelligence to outsmart the men around her. People start out by rooting for her,\" co-director Andr\u00c3\u00a9s Baiz added.\n'Power made her a monster'\nBy 1970, Blanco had ordered her first husband to be killed and moved to Miami. There she met her second husband, drug trafficker Alberto Bravo, who introduced her to an even darker side of the narcotics underworld.\nBlanco's propensity for violence and audacious approach to drug smuggling - flying young women from Colombia to the US with cocaine hidden in their bras and underwear - meant she was soon running the entire criminal enterprise.\nAs the Miami drug wars intensified and rival cartels violently clashed, Blanco grew more ruthless. In 1975 she shot her husband because she believed he was stealing money from her, and in 1983, she had her third husband assassinated after he left Miami with the couple's child, Michael Corleone.\nNicknamed the Black Widow for her brutal and ruthless behaviour, Blanco's empire boomed, and by the early 1980s she was one of the world's richest and most feared women, overseeing the trafficking of 1.5 tonnes of cocaine to the US every month.\n\"I really think when Griselda first moved to Miami her intentions were all about protecting and taking care of her family, but along the way she got lost and the power and money turned her into a monster,\" Vergara told the BBC.\nIn the early 1980s Blanco rejected a $15m from a rival cartel to give her empire up.\n'Relied on misfits'\nDespite ruling the narco empire in Miami with an iron fist for two decades, Blanco was acutely aware that as a woman in an industry run almost exclusively by chauvinistic men, her position was precarious. At one point she allowed a man to front her business as local dealers would \"only accept a deal if it came out of a man's mouth\".\nFollowing his arrest for a murder, Blanco chose to front the business herself and used her outsider position to her advantage.\nBetween April and September 1980, approximately 135,000 Cubans immigrated to the US. Known as the Marielitos, some of them were already involved in criminal gangs, drug trafficking and contract killing.\nBlanco capitalised on this and recruited them to work for her. Her cartel developed its own group of hitmen, Pistoleros, who became known for their motorcycle assassinations.\nBlanco \"is an outsider and recruits all these other outsiders around her\", said Baiz, and in an industry where trust was difficult to gain and even harder to keep, she \"knew what she was doing\".\n\"These characters are all misfits, they don't belong to the normal standards of society. Griselda knows this and makes them feel like they are part of her family,\" Baiz added.\nIt was Blanco's status as a misfit that appealed to Vergara as she \"understood\" some of what she went through.\n\"I am Colombian, a mother and an immigrant. As a woman Griselda was judged and nowadays I know because of my accent I have to work extra hard and I get less opportunities,\" she said.\n'A woman could never be this evil'\nBy the mid-1980s, Blanco's criminal empire began to unravel and her reign of terror came to an abrupt halt when she was arrested in Irvine, California.\nBut how",

Mr Fisher refused.\nOne of the group said it was because Mr Fisher \"had been acting bad\" at The Farm, a pub in Solihull he had been at with Mr Newman and others on Christmas Eve.\nAs the group regathered, Mr Newman said he did not know what the problem was, and tried to get Mr Fisher to leave the situation by directing him towards the dancefloor. He recalled saying there would be \"safety in numbers\" and \"let's go\".\nBut a fight quickly broke out, he said, with punches thrown at Mr Fisher who was trying to defend himself.\nMr Newman grabbed him but he came loose and he tried again as the fighting continued, but Mr Fisher \"seemed to fall backwards\" to the floor as he grabbed him by his stomach with his arm.\nHe was unresponsive, and thinking he had been knocked out, Mr Newman shook him and shouted his name, but he felt a \"warm wetness\" on his hand which he realised was Mr Fisher's blood, jurors heard.\nMr Newman said he had shouted \"he's been stabbed\" and \"he's bleeding... he's dying\" as he ran to a bar to raise help, \"unimpressed\" with the immediate reaction of security in the premises.\nHe went to call an ambulance himself then left the venue to meet paramedics outside to take them to his friend.\n'He's gone'\nThe court heard the phone operator asked if Mr Fisher was breathing to which Mr Newman said 'no, he's dead\".\nAmbulance crews subsequently confirmed to him Mr Fisher had died.\nHe described members of the group, as white and dark-skinned with one wearing a ski mask \"just under his eyes\".\nGeorge Robinson, another friend with Mr Fisher in Crane at the time, told jurors Mr Fisher \"looked terrified\" when someone from the group of between six to 10 people shouted at him to go outside.\nHe described two people who then allegedly attacked Mr Fisher, with one male headbutting him, he said.\nThat male, he said, was black with braided hair and about 6ft 5' tall wearing a black hooded top with a Balenciaga label on the back.\nThe second was of mixed race, wearing a grey tracksuit and about 6ft tall with short hair, aged in his 20s.

The Kremlin maintains that elections are fair and he is genuinely popular.\nOpposition leader Alexey Navalny, once seen as a major threat to the president's authority, has been in jail since 2021.\nOther opponents have been assassinated, jailed, or forced into exile.\nBut Mr Nadezhdin, a former MP and local councillor, is seen as a former insider of the regime whose criticism of the Kremlin has so far been tolerated.\nHis team says he has gathered more than 100,000 signatures, enough to stand as a candidate.\nHe believes he will be allowed to stand in the elections, although unconfirmed sources say anti-war candidates will be barred.\nThis was the case with former TV journalist Yekaterina Duntsova, whose candidacy was blocked in December.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday that Mr Nadezhdin was not seen as a rival but would be allowed to stand if he met the necessary conditions.\nThe veteran politician says he has been criticising Mr Putin for the last 10 years.\n\"He practically destroyed the key institutions of the modern state of Russia. My job will be to restore these institutions,\" said Mr Nadezhdin.\n\"My first task will be to stop the conflict with Ukraine, and then to restore normal relations between Russia and the Western community.\"\nMr Nadezhdin, who name is similar to \"nadezhda\", the Russian word for hope, said he had the support of \"dozens of millions of people\".\n\"There is a Russian saying - your appetite comes when you start eating,\" he says.\nHe said that as recently as two weeks ago, no-one would have believed he could collect enough signatures.\n\"My aim is to change Russia. I may not be president on 17 March but I should have the best result.\"\nHe said that at the start of the war only 15-20% of people were against it but now the \"majority of Russians\" wanted peace.\nHe said he aimed to make Russia a \"great, peaceful and free country\".\n\"I am absolutely sure that Putin will not rule Russia six years more, because more and more people understand he is dragging Russia along the track of militarism, authoritarianism, isolation,\" Mr Nadezhdin says.",
    "Facial recognition cameras are being trialled to help stop those banned from pubs and clubs gaining access.\nThe scheme, which is taking place in Southampton, is running for three months across six venues.\nIt has been brought in after businesses found previous offenders were still getting into night-time venues due to fake IDs or human error.\nThe camera uses images of 65 banned offenders and alerts doors staff once they attempt to enter a venue.\nGO! Southampton, the Business Improvement District (BID) in the city, said it currently ran a red card scheme which meant once an individual was banned from one night-time venue, they were banned from them all.\nJade McCauley, operations manager at GO! Southampton, said: \"We've had incidents in the past where individuals that have had an exclusion have got into venues accidently, either through human error or using fake IDs.\n\"And then they've reoffended, they've caused other incidents and then their ban's been extended.\n\"So, we think using this technology, we're safeguarding people having a good night out from criminals that shouldn't be in our night-time economy.\"\nJack Pearce, head doorman at Orange Rooms, said: \"We do see quite a lot of people come through, especially in this area but there's a lot of faces, and a lot of new faces, on the scheme.\n\"So, unless we're constantly on the website checking, it's quite hard to remember all those faces.\n\"So, anything that can assist us on the door and make the whole area a lot safer, it doesn't just benefit us as a venue, it benefits the area.\"\nIf a person is not recognised on the cameras, data will be instantly deleted from the system as the cameras only match against the images of those currently banned.\nThe trial, which launched in December, has already flagged six offenders to door staff.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "A young soldier who reportedly collapsed during hot weather died of \"natural causes\", the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said.\nSapper Connor Morrison, 20, of 23 Parachute Engineer Regiment stationed in Woodbridge, Suffolk, died in Ipswich Hospital on 23 July, 2022.\nA Defence Safety Authority investigation is ongoing, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) said.\nIt previously confirmed the soldier died in a \"non-operational incident\".\nParamedics attended the barracks on 21 July after Sapper Morrison, from Erksine in Renfrewshire, Scotland, suffered breathing difficulties, the East of England Ambulance Service said.\nAround the time the UK was experiencing record high temperatures, with 40.3C (105F) being recorded in Coningsby, Lincolnshire, on 19 July.\nIn a tribute, his commanding officer Lt Col Jack Crossley, described Sapper Morrison as a \"professional soldier with much promise\".\nHe was well-liked by his fellow soldiers and an \"avid supporter of Scottish football\", enjoying winding up his English colleagues, the Lt Col said.\n\"Keen and enthusiastic, he worked hard to achieve his goals at every stage of his training and impressed his instructors with his knowledge and skills.

    "Ryanair has cut its profit expectations for the year to the end of March, after some online travel agents stopped selling its flights.\nThe airline reduced fares to fill seats in December after it said sites including Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak suddenly removed its flights .\nRyanair said it expected profits of up to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.95bn (\u00c2\u00a31.7bn), down from its forecast of up to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2.05bn in November.\nA sharp increase in the airline's fuel bill has also hit profits.\nIn the October to December quarter, its fuel costs jumped 35% to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.2bn.\nOnline agents row\nIn January, Ryanair hit out against a number of online travel agents, including Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak, after it said its flights had been suddenly removed from their websites.\nEurope's largest airline by passenger numbers has been in a long-running dispute with online booking sites, after the airline launched legal action in the US against Booking.com owner Booking Holdings and its subsidiaries including Kayak, Agoda and Priceline.\nIt followed an Irish High Court ruling which banned screenscraper Flightbox from gathering Ryanair flight information for online travel agents.\nThe airline said the removal of its flights from the websites would increase the number of empty seats on its planes in the short term, and it dropped its direct booking prices in response.\nIn its latest set of results , Ryanair predicted an after-tax profit of between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.85bn and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.95bn for the year to the end of March, lower than a forecast of between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.85bn and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2.05bn it made in November.\nIt said its revenue per paying passenger had been weaker than the previous year, blaming it on the removal of flights from online travel agents, despite its passenger numbers and fares being higher.\nHowever, the airline's chief financial officer, Neil Sorahan, told the Reuters news agency that the impact of being removed from some online agents' sites would be temporary and was already beginning to \"fizzle out\".\nThe after-tax figure would still beat its previous record annual after-tax profit of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.45bn in 2018, and follows a boom in profits for the airline in November, after the airline hiked prices.\nRyanair said passenger numbers had risen 11% to a record 105.4 million in the six months to September, despite average fares rising by 24%.\nThe airline warned that the possibility of further delays in the delivery of new, more fuel-efficient Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft could also affect profits.\nIt also added that its full-year result remained heavily dependent on \"avoiding unforeseen adverse events (such as the Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas conflict)\".",

    "The financial crisis facing England's councils is \"out of control\" with even well-run local authorities at risk of going bust, MPs have warned.\nA cross-party committee said the government must plug a \u00c2\u00a34bn funding gap to avoid a \"severe impact\" on services.\nThey also called for council tax to be reformed, describing the current system as \"outdated\" and \"regressive\".\nThe government said it recognised the challenges facing councils and had announced an extra \u00c2\u00a3600m in support.\nIn a new report, the Commons Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee said councils were being hit by \"systemic underfunding\", as well as increased costs and demands for services.\nThe Local Government Association estimates councils in England are facing a funding gap of \u00c2\u00a34bn over the next two years.\nLabour MP Clive Betts, who chairs the committee, said: \"If the government fails to plug this gap, well-run councils could face the very real prospect of effectively going bust.\"\nIn November, Nottingham became the eighth council to issue a Section 114 notice in the past six years , which means it is effectively bankrupt.\nIn the previous 18 years no councils had done so.\nEarlier this month the government announced an \u00c2\u00a3600m funding boost for councils in England , following pressure from local authorities and MPs.\nThe figure is on top of a \u00c2\u00a364bn funding package for 2024-25, which was announced in December.\nThe committee said the additional money was welcome but that it believed further funding increases were needed.\nDoes your council have financial issues? If so, how have services been affected? Please get in touch.\nThe report highlights how councils are particularly struggling with increased demand and costs for services including social care, transport for children with special educational needs and disabilities, as well as homelessness support and temporary accommodation.\nSusan Hinchcliffe, the Labour leader of Bradford City Council, told the committee nearly 50% of the council's entire budget was now being spent on children's social care but this was still not enough to cope with current pressures.\nShe said services were \"grappling with high agency costs, high placement costs and dizzying levels of demand\".\nCouncils are also seeing increased costs and demand for transport to special schools outside of their local area.\nAn officer at North Yorkshire Council told the committee spending on school transport for children with special educational needs and disabilities had increased from \u00c2\u00a35m to \u00c2\u00a321m over the past five years.\nIn the longer-term, the report calls for a fundamental review of council funding, local taxation and the delivery of social care services.\nMr Betts said: \"Councils being forced to hike up council tax, in a forlorn attempt to plug increasingly large holes in their budgets, is unsustainable and unfair to local people who are, year on year, seeing less services while paying more.\"\nThe committee said the increasing reliance on council tax to fund services had a disproportionate negative impact on funding levels for authorities in more deprived areas.\nIt highlighted that council tax charges were based on property valuations from 1991 and because house prices had risen considerably since then, people living in the most valuable homes were paying less in council tax as a proportion of their property's value than those in the least valuable properties.\nIt urged the government to undertake a revaluation of properties, consider wider reform of the system and introduce additional council tax bands.\nA Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: \"We recognise councils are facing challenges and that is why we recently announced an additional \u00c2\u00a3600m support package for councils across England, increasing their overall proposed funding for next year to \u00c2\u00a364.7bn - a 7.5% increase in cash terms.\n\"This additional funding has been welcomed by leading local government organisations, but we remain ready to talk to any concerned council about its financial position.\"",

    "Russia has once again extended the pre-trial detention of American journalist Evan Gershkovich, 32, who was arrested last year on espionage charges.\nThe court ordered that his detention be extended until 30 March which means the Wall Street Journal reporter will spend over one year behind bars as he awaits trial.\nMr Gershkovich, his newspaper, and the US deny the espionage charges.\nUS officials have called for his immediate release.\n\"The grounds for Evan's detention are baseless,\" the American embassy in Moscow tweeted on Friday. \"Journalism is not a crime.  We continue to call for Evan's immediate release.\"\nHis arrest marked the first time Moscow had accused a US journalist of espionage since the Soviet era.\nMr Gershkovich was arrested in the city of Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow, while reporting on the war in Ukraine on 29 March.\nIt is the fourth time his detention has been extended and as a result he will continue to be held in Moscow's Lefortovo prison.

    "Two women have died following a fire at a block of flats in Aberdeen.\nEmergency services were sent to Back Hilton Road at about 18:00 on Monday. The women were pronounced dead at the scene.\nNeighbouring properties were evacuated and a baby was taken to hospital but was later discharged. The BBC understands the baby was not related to either of the women.\nA joint police and fire investigation is being carried out into the cause.\nHowever, police said there did not appear to be any suspicious circumstances.\nFive others were rescued and treated by the Scottish Ambulance Service.\nOne local resident, who did not wish to be named, told BBC Scotland News she saw people being rescued from the building via a window and taken down ladders.\nDr Unaiza Imtiaz, 31, lives in an adjacent block of flats with her partner Dr Ehsan Ali, 35, and five-year-old son Shazil Ehsan.\nShe said the family were out at the time of the fire but when they got home were met with ambulances, fire engines and police cars.\n\"The area was cordoned off. All we could see was the smoke going into the sky,\" she said.\n\"It was the same building so it was really scary. We feel really sorry that two people lost their lives.\n\"It's not a good thing to recall, especially with a little one who is afraid when people are talking about someone being dead.\n\"I really pray for the ones who have gone.\"\nAshley Finnie, 33, who lives in a flat next to the one where the women died, said she was not home when firefighters came but could see and speak to them on a doorbell camera.\n\"I could just see firefighters running back and forth,\" she said.\n\"It turned out it was my next-door neighbours but I don't know them.\n\"It's horrible.

    "Kremlin challenger Boris Nadezhdin says he has collected enough signatures to stand as a candidate in Russia's upcoming presidential election.\nThe former MP has become known for his relatively outspoken criticism of Mr Putin and of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nMr Nadezhdin said he handed over more than the 100,000 required signatures to the electoral authorities.\nThe electoral commission must now review his application.\nIf any \"irregularities\" are found with any of the submitted signatures, the commission can disqualify the candidate altogether. Independent politician Yekaterina Duntsova was disqualified from running in December when the electoral commission said it had found 100 \"mistakes\" on her form.\nCurrent President Vladimir Putin has already registered as an independent candidate for the election in March, which will almost certainly see him win another six-year term.\nShortly after today's deadline to hand in the signatures, Mr Nadezhdin posted a photo of himself standing in front of several boxes containing papers bearing the signatures of his supporters.\n\"This is my pride - the work of thousands of people over many sleepless days. The result of the queues you stood in in the freezing cold is in those boxes,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\nThousands of Russians have queued in the cold across the country to add their signature to the list of people supporting his bid.\nMr Nadezhdin, 60, a member of the State Duma from 1999-2003, was nominated to stand in the election by the centre-right Civic Initiative party in December 2023.\nHe has long been a frequent guest on talk shows on state TV channels, where he has often criticised Russia's war on Ukraine.\nHe recently said the president had \"practically destroyed the key institutions of the modern state of Russia\", and told the BBC that, if elected, his first task would be to end the war .\nIn a country where opposition figures have been jailed or even assassinated, his recent criticism of Mr Putin appears to have been tolerated so far.\nWhen asked about Mr Nadezhdin earlier this month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"We don't see him as a rival.\"\nOn Tuesday, Mr Nadezhdin told the BBC's Newshour programme that he had \"no fear\" about running, although he also said elections in Russia \"are not free and not fair\".\nAsked about his criticism of the war in Ukraine, he said that invading the country was a \"fatal mistake\" which \"dragged [Russia] into the track of authoritarianism and isolation\".\n\"First of all we should finish killing each other and then there will be long, long negotiations about the border,\" he said.\nEven if Mr Nadezhdin is allowed to run, it is not yet known if he will be allowed to campaign freely.\nIn Vladimir Putin's Russia, candidates have previously been able to run in elections when it is generally assumed that they don't stand a chance, and sometimes they don't even campaign against the incumbent.\nThis maintains a facade of democracy, and in the case of Mr Nadezhdin it would allow Russians dissatisfied with the \"special military operation\" to vent their anger and frustration in a way that would not threaten Mr Putin's rule.\nIn recent years, genuine popular opposition figures - such as Alexei Navalny and Ilya Yashin - have been handed lengthy jail sentences. Others, such as Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov - for whom Mr Nadezhdin once worked as an adviser - have been killed.\nRussia's political scene has been dominated by Vladimir Putin since 2000. In 2020, a constitutional amendment was passed allowing him to stay in power beyond 2024.\nA victory in March would see him remain as president until 2030. After that, he can then potentially serve another six years until 2036 if he decides to stand again.",

    "The number of illegal vapes seized at the border quadrupled last year as UK authorities wrestle with unlicensed imports amid a surge in youth vaping.\nMore than 4.5m vapes weighing nearly ten tonnes were seized over the last 12 months, four times more than 2022.\nThe figures were released to the BBC after a Freedom of Information (FOI) request.\nThe government is soon to announce new rules for the industry, including a possible ban on disposable vapes.\nThe single-use products have surged in popularity since the pandemic. With bright packaging and flavours named after sweets and soft drinks, there have been calls to restrict their marketing to protect children. It is illegal to sell them to under-18s.\nDisposable e-cigarettes have strict limits on their nicotine levels in the UK - just 2ml of liquid with 20mg of nicotine per millilitre provide around 500-600 puffs of vapour.\nHowever, Chinese-made vapes which contain much larger amounts of liquid and promise thousands of puffs are widely available in the UK.\nOn London's Oxford Street, illegal disposable vapes offering 3,500 puffs are openly on sale. BBC News was also easily able to buy two vapes containing 4.5ml of liquid from two UK-based online retailers.\n\"They're out there in broad daylight, in plain view. It is scary how prevalent they are,\" said Dan Marchant of the online retailer Vape Club. \"People are getting away with it. They are acting with complete impunity.\"\nThousand-fold increase\nFigures released to the BBC in response to an FOI request show that Border Force seized just 4,430 vapes in 2021, rising to 988,064 in 2022, and 4,537,689 from January to October 2023.\nUnlike legal vapes, illegal e-cigarettes are not registered with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and do not pass through quality control processes so may contain harmful chemicals.\nAnd retailers prepared to flout product rules may not be scrupulous about observing the ban on selling to under-18s.\nA Home Office spokesperson said the government would \"not tolerate the sale of illegal products and... harmful goods, such as illegal or counterfeit vapes\".\n\"Border Force work closely with law enforcement partners to share intelligence and have a strong track record in targeting illicit commodities,\" they added.\nIn most cases, Border Force seizes vapes for breaching product safety rules, though it also seizes fake versions of legal vapes, and shipments which breach customs procedures.\nWhile Border Force is responsible for intercepting vapes coming into Britain from overseas, once they are in the UK the responsibility falls to Trading Standards teams at local councils.\nCrackdown on illegal vapes\nLast April the government announced \u00c2\u00a33m for a \"crackdown\" on illegal vapes and underage sales.\nUnder Operation Joseph, Trading Standards seized more than one million vapes last year with officers visiting 2,000 retail premises, during which they found evidence 500 were willing to sell to minors.\nMeanwhile, Vape Club carried out its own research and sent FOI requests to 389 councils around the UK, asking Trading Standards officers how many vapes had been seized over the past five years.\nAmong the 152 replies, the total number of seizures had risen from from next to none in 2020, to more than 1.5 million last year.\nIn Manchester, a hub for both the legal and illegal vape trade, Trading Standards seized 158,000 illegal vapes in 2023, more than a tenfold increase on the previous year.\nIn 2022, the council and police launched Operation Vulcan, a crackdown on the counterfeit goods trade - bringing in a number of illegal vapes as well as fake luxury goods, prescription medicines and cash.\nThe council also believes the increased haul is down to increased illegal activity.\nThe London Borough of Hillingdon, however, which includes Heathrow airport, saw a sharp decline in vape seizures. From 1.35 million in 2022, it confiscated 224,000 last year.\nThe council said increased enforcement around the airport may have led importers to use other routes.\nMeanwhile, Kent County Council told the BBC it had seized over 440,000 vapes at shops and the Channel ports, working together with Border Force.\nA disposable ban?\nThe government is soon expected to introduce new rules to tighten up the market, which could range from an outright ban on disposable vapes to a licencing scheme for retailers and a tax.\nSupporters of a tax on the single-use products argue that putting them through the same tightly controlled system as cigarettes and alcohol would help to reduce illegal imports.\nBut Mr Marchant, and others in the industry, argue that a ban on disposables could lead to a surge in demand for illegal vapes.\nDeborah Arnott, chief executive of the anti-smoking charity Action on Smoking and Health said: \"If disposable vapes are banned then Border Force and HM Revenue and Customs will have a much bigger job to do to prevent illegal vapes being imported into the UK, making it even more imperative that there's a properly",
    "I met Andrew Kazadi just after his 26-year-old nephew died of cholera at a treatment centre in Zambia's capital, Lusaka. He looked deeply traumatised.\n\"We have been told to look for a coffin but if we delay, they'll bury him just like that,\" Mr Kazadi said, in comments reminiscent of some of the restrictions governments imposed during the coronavirus pandemic.\nNow, cholera, a bacterial infection caused by contaminated water or food, is wreaking havoc in Zambia, with more than 15,000 cases and close to 600 deaths recorded, mostly in the hotspot of Lusaka, since the beginning of the rainy season in October.\nAnd as clouds gathered over the skies before another downpour, Mr Kazadi said: \"We have to hurry to get a coffin.\"\nI met him outside the 60,000-seater Heroes Stadium, which has been turned into a treatment centre with about 800 medics attending to patients from across the country.\nThe sound of the wailing sirens of ambulances is constant. Patients are brought in or taken for burial after succumbing to the disease.\nFor Mr Kazadi, to see the lifeless corpse of Charles, his sister's son, came as a shock.\nCharles suffered a bout of diarrhoea and was vomiting. He was taken to a clinic, where the family was told he had cholera.\nHe was then transferred to the stadium - normally a venue for football matches - where he died eight days later.\n\"Our expectation was that he would be fine with the passage of time. We are really grieving as a family,\" Mr Kazadi said, pointing out that his nephew has left behind a three-year-old.\nBut in a sign of the family's deep faith, he added: \"When someone is sick, we commit everything into God's hands - that person can either die or survive. With all the challenges we have gone through, we just have to thank God.\"\nIn line with government regulations to curb the spread of the disease, Charles' corpse was wrapped in a body bag, before being placed in the coffin by men wearing protective gear.\nThe family was not allowed to touch the body to protect them from the risk of infection. Only five relatives were allowed to attend Charles' burial.\nThe government's guidelines are similar to those of the World Health Organization (WHO), which advises that families should handle the body as little as possible , and burials should preferably take place within 24 hours.\n\"Gastrointestinal infections [like cholera] can easily be transmitted from faeces leaked from dead bodies ,\" the WHO says.\nSadly, some families in Lusaka are going through a trauma different from that of the Kazadis.\nThey do not know the fate of their loved ones, as over-stretched health workers have been been unable to tell them about their condition - or whether they are even alive.\nThey include Eunice Chongo, who told me that her 34-year-old son, Boniface, was brought by ambulance to the stadium about a week ago, but she has not heard anything about him since then.\n\"All I want is for the government to tell me the truth about the whereabouts of my son,\" Ms Chongo said, looking distressed.\nThe government has set up a call centre, urging people like Ms Chongo to report missing family so that they can help trace them.\nZambia has experienced cholera outbreaks at least 30 times since 1977, with the charity WaterAid saying the latest one is the worst since 2017 .\nThis is despite the fact that the government pledged in 2019 to eliminate the disease by 2025.\nWaterAid's Zambia director Yankho Mataya said the government would not meet its goal \"without greater increased investment and improved co-ordination to address the root cause - lack of access to clean water and decent sanitation\".\nResearch published in 2019 showed that a staggeringly high number of Zambians - 40% - lived without adequate clean water, while as many as 85% lacked access to proper solid waste management.\nThe coordinator of Zambia's Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit, Gabriel Pollen, said data was still being collected to assess what progress had been made since 2019 to improve water and sanitation facilities.\n\"The numbers are quite alarming, and we do see here reluctance on the part of communities in terms of hygiene,\" he said.\nThe cholera hot-spots in Lusaka are poor neighbourhoods, known locally as compounds, where people live in slum-like conditions.\nOften pit latrines are built too close to shallow wells, from where drinking water is drawn.\nWhen it rains, the water level rises, along with the risk of human waste contaminating the water - and poor drainage causes this water to flood homes.\nTo fight the disease, a raft of measures have been introduced by the government, including a ban on the digging of shallow wells, and the selling of food in unhygienic conditions.\nIn a speech earlier this month, President Hakainde Hichilema promised also to upgrade poorly planned informal settlements, and to prevent new ones from emerging.\nSome young people were \"hanging around and doing nothing\" in cities and towns instead of moving to rural areas to farm, the president said.",
    "The home secretary has said deportations under the UK's agreement with Rwanda could be \"quite low\", depending on other factors.\nJames Cleverly told MPs the agreement with the east African nation was \"only one part\" of the government's response to illegal migration.\nReturns deals with other countries could also have a \"very significant impact\" on the number sent, he added.\nHowever, he refused to predict how many deportations would take place.\nHe added that the agreement with Rwanda was uncapped - and an exact number was \"entirely contingent on a whole set of other work\".\nQuestions over the cost of the scheme have grown louder after it emerged last month the UK has paid \u00c2\u00a3240m to Rwanda so far , despite legal wrangles meaning no one has yet been sent there.\nUnder the five-year plan, the UK would send an unspecified number of asylum seekers to Rwanda - where they can apply to become a refugee there, or seek asylum in another \"safe third country\".\nLegislation to revive the scheme after it was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court was passed by MPs earlier this month, but is expected to run into considerable opposition in the House of Lords.\nDespite the opposition to the plan, ministers are aiming to get the first flights off by the spring and hope it will then deter people from crossing the Channel in small boats.\nAt a session of the Home Affairs Committee, a top Home Official official said 33,085 asylum seekers had entered the system since new legal obligations to remove illegal arrivals, subject to certain conditions, came into force last July .\n'Send a signal'\nAsked how many of these could be sent to Rwanda, Mr Cleverly told the MPs the number of people sent could be \"nearly at\" that figure, but it was \"entirely contingent\" on the circumstances.\nIt was \"entirely feasible a significant number within that cohort will be returned to their country of origin,\" he argued, whilst deals with other countries could also \"have a very significant impact\".\n\"It may well be if we're successful with returns agreements, if circumstances in other countries change, it may well be that the figure could be quite low,\" he added.\nUnder repeated questioning, he refused to put a figure on the number of deportations required to create a deterrent effect - but conceded they would need to \"visibly send a signal\" to potential migrants.\nHome Office officials have declined to sign off the scheme as value for money, arguing the extent to which it will deter migrants is impossible to calculate until flights to Rwanda actually begin.\n'Gimmick'\nMinisters say once up and running, the scheme will save taxpayers money by reducing the amount the government spends on housing migrants in UK hotels, currently \u00c2\u00a38m a day .\nHowever, the department has struggled to return large numbers of the small boat migrants coming to the UK in recent years.\nLast month it emerged that only 1,040 small boat arrivals who weren't foreign convicted criminals have been returned to their country, or another country, in the last three years.\nOf these, only 408 were not nationals of Albania, with which the government struck a co-operation deal to speed up returns in late 2022.\nAs an EU member, the UK could return hundreds of migrants a year under the so-called Dublin regulations - but the EU has refused to replicate this as part of a new agreement.\nLabour has described the Rwanda policy as a \"gimmick\" and vowed to scrap it if it wins power at the general election later this year.\nIt also says it would negotiate a new deal with the EU to return migrants there.\nThe party has suggested that in exchange it may be willing to accept a quota of migrants in the UK, but has not specified what this would be.",

On that date we will have an audience, so why not educate them?\"\nThe Ballardong First Festival is one of hundreds of gatherings this weekend funded by the National Australia Day Council (NADC) - the body tasked with organising celebrations.\nIn recent years it has shifted away from patriotic pageantry towards events which \"acknowledge past wrongs\" and the \"survival, resilience and enduring culture\" of Indigenous communities.\nBut as more people and businesses quietly opt out, and annual \"Invasion Day\" protests gather steam, some experts say it's unclear if revamping Australia Day will help future-proof it.\nA shift among brands and councils\nThe controversy stems from a debate over the appropriateness of celebrating Australia on a day when Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people began being stripped of their lands and cut off from their culture.\nPolls show about 60% of Australians see no issue with keeping the holiday as is.\nBut in recent years, they have suggested small shifts in public sentiment in favour of finding an alternative date - particularly among young people.\nAnd the list of celebrities, sporting stars, and big-name brands distancing themselves from the holiday grows.\nEarlier this month the nation's largest retailer, Woolworths, announced it was axing its Australia Day merchandise - such as caps, tattoos, and plastic flags - due to a \"gradual decline in demand\".\nAustralian men's cricket captain Pat Cummins also recently threw his weight behind finding \"a more appropriate day to celebrate\", as did his deputy Steve Smith.\nOther critics of the day take even more staunch views.\nBut many Australians also proudly celebrate it, decking themselves out in flags and other regalia to attend sporting events, BBQs, concerts and firework displays across the country.\nDemand from councils and community groups seeking funding to host festivities is \"as high as it's ever been\", according to the NADC.\nAnd it says a years-long campaign aimed at increasing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation and \"setting a new tone for Australia Day\" has been a \"great success\".\nBuilt around the slogan \"reflect, respect, celebrate\", its advertisements highlighting the \"raw\" and \"painful\" parts of Australian history are a dramatic departure from the days when the holiday was marketed as a chance to give thanks for \"beaches, lamington drives, and Kylie [Minogue]\".\n\"A quiet rebranding is probably a useful way to think about it,\" explains Rachel Busbridge, a sociology lecturer at the Australian Catholic University.\n\"They're trying to create a day that is of resonance and relevance to people. That's the aim, and it says a lot about the shift in Australian society.\"\nDr Busbridge - who has long studied the public discourse around 26 January - says it will \"always be a significant day in the national psyche\".\nBut she's not convinced that the current efforts to preserve it will stand the test of time.\n\"'Invasion Day' marches are only growing with each year. We're talking up to 50,000 people at some events. And there's more and more popping up, as well as a steady growth in 'Survival Day' festivals.\"\n\"Another clear trend is that young Australians increasingly see this as a problematic day, so that might mean it's necessary to find a different date.\"\nFor its part though, the NADC says it has seen no signs of declining public participation in its celebrations.\nCalls for 'truth-telling'\nRoughly 110km (68 miles) west of York, a council in Fremantle is taking an entirely different approach to the holiday.\nIn 2017, its decision to move its Australia Day events to a \"more inclusive\" date became a political flashpoint - prompting a stern rebuke from the previous federal government, as well as threats from far-right groups.\nUltimately it stuck though, and Fremantle later won a national award for promoting Indigenous re",

    "The head of the European Court of Human Rights says countries have a \"clear legal obligation\" to follow its injunctions, despite UK ministers considering ignoring them.\nThe government's Rwanda bill aims to stop legal challenges against plans to send asylum seekers to the country.\nIn June 2022, the ECHR stopped the first Rwanda flight, saying British judges had not ruled on the plan.\nIt comes as the House of Lords prepares to debate the Rwanda bill next week.\nDowning Street said the government was confident its Rwanda legislation was compliant with the UK's international obligations.\nThe legislation, passed by MPs last week, could face substantial opposition in the Lords - and ministers have formally admitted in a statement that it may breach the European Convention on Human Rights.\nA key element of the government's plan would allow ministers to ignore the Strasbourg-based court's so-called Rule 39 orders - more commonly known as a court injunction.\nIn June 2022, an ECHR judge used that power to temporarily stop the first Rwanda flight, until the migrants on board had had a chance to put their case to British judges.\nThat delay in the flight allowed the migrants to take their case to the UK Supreme Court, which ruled last year that the entire plan was unlawful.\nSpeaking to journalists at the ECHR's annual press conference, the court's president, Siofra O'Leary, said: \"There is a clear legal obligation under the [European Convention on Human Rights] for states to comply with Rule 39 measures.\n\"The court issues interim measures in exceptional circumstances where there is a real and imminent risk of irreparable harm.\"\nWhile she did not comment directly on the political row over the Rwanda plan, President O'Leary said: \"Rule 39 measures are almost always sought in situations of urgency, if not extreme urgency.\n\"And the nature of the urgency, or the degree of urgency, is something which governments control. The court doesn't control the degree of urgency.\"\nShe said that in 2023 the court had received 61 requests to make an emergency intervention against the UK. Only one of those had been granted as genuinely necessary.\nSeparately, in 2021 the UK had urged Moscow to comply with one of the court's Rule 39 orders, demanding the release of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. And last year another order had helped save the lives of two British fighters in Ukraine who had been taken captive by Russian forces.\n\"[The UK] has always complied with Rule 39 measures going all the way back to the...1950s and stays of execution,\" she said.\n\"In only one case, to my knowledge...did the UK fail to comply...but the factual circumstances of that case, were very particular.\"\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said: \"I've been very clear, I won't let a foreign court stop us from getting flights up and running.\"\nHe said his Rwanda bill included a \"specific power\", allowing ministers to decide whether to ignore the court's rulings.\n\"I would not have put that power in there if I wasn't prepared to use it,\" he added.\nDowning Street argued that its treaty with Rwanda and the bill addressed the concerns raised by the Supreme Court, and ministers had \"created the conditions\" to avoid legal challenges.\n\"There should be no need for Strasburg to intervene to block flights in the way they did in 2022,\" the prime minister's official spokesman added.\nWhile the judge said she could and would not comment on the UK government's plans for new legislation over Rwanda, her intervention will embolden critics who are piling pressure on the House of Lords to stop the plan.\nPeers have already defeated the government in a symbolic vote over approving the UK's new treaty with Rwanda - saying that it should not come into force until the African nation has passed new laws to make its asylum system fairer.",

    "A US mother on trial for failing to stop her son from carrying out a deadly school shooting has sought to put the blame on her husband.\nJennifer Crumbley, taking the stand in her own defence, told jurors that the gun she and her husband purchased for their son was not her responsibility.\nMrs Crumbley is the first parent to go on trial for a mass shooting carried out by a child.\nHer husband, James, is facing a separate trial on the same charges.\nIf found guilty, they each face up to 15 years in prison.\nTheir son is serving life in prison for killing four classmates at Oxford High School in Michigan in 2021. He was 15 years old at the time of the attack.\nMrs Crumbley, 45, took the stand on Thursday,  the sixth day of the trial.\nShe was the first witness to testify for the defence after the prosecution presented 21 witnesses. Prosecutors will cross-examine her on Friday.\nMrs Crumbley said her husband brought their son to a gun store the day after Thanksgiving to buy a handgun for him as a gift.\nShe \"didn't feel comfortable\" being responsible for safely storing the gun, which had a cable lock, she said.\n\"It was more his thing, so I let him handle that,\" she said. \"I didn't feel comfortable putting the lock thing on it. I'd just rather not, and let him do it.\"\nA few days later, her husband removed the lock so she could take her son to a gun range, she said, describing it as a fun day.\nThe lock's key was kept in a beer stein displayed in the kitchen, and her husband hid the gun in their bedroom. She said she did not know that her son knew where it was kept.\nDuring the attacker's trial last year, his attorneys argued he was neglected by his parents and suffered from mental illness. But he later said his parents did not know about his plans and that he was solely responsible.\nHis lawyers have said that he will invoke his right to remain silent if called to testify at his parents' trials.\nMrs Crumbley's legal team say she could not have predicted her son's actions and she is being unfairly blamed.\nEarlier in the day, prosecutors presented text messages and diary entries from her son that they said showed he was having hallucinations.\n\"I have zero help for my mental problems and it's causing me to shoot up the ... school,\" he wrote in one diary entry.\n\"I want help, but my parents don't listen to me so I can't get any help,\" he wrote in another entry submitted by prosecutors.\nIn court, Mrs Crumbley said that she believed many of his text messages - which included some referencing \"demons\" and clothes \"flying off the shelf\" - were just \"messing around\".\n\"He's been convinced our house has been haunted since 2015,\" she added, adding that her son dubbed the ghost \"Boris Johnson\".\nOne of prosecutors' key arguments is that the parents did not help their child get the mental health support he needed.\nProsecutor Marc Keast told the jury last week: \"Jennifer Crumbley didn't pull the trigger that day, but she is responsible for those deaths.\"\nOn the day of the shooting, school officials found the boy with disturbing drawings.\nHis parents were called to school to review the drawings, but left after concluding the meeting early because they said they needed to return to work.\nNone of the adults checked the boy's backpack, where he stored the gun, and he was sent back to class.",

    "\"People usually apologise after cracking jokes,\" Indian stand-up comic Munawar Faruqui says in an episode of Bigg Boss, a popular reality TV show.\n\"But in my case, it's best if I do it in advance.\"\nHis humour wasn't missed on the millions of Indians watching the programme, a homegrown version of UK's Big Brother. In the show, 21 contestants are isolated in a custom-built house, where they are filmed around the clock and are evicted through weekly audience votes.\nWithin the eclectic mix of contestants, Faruqui stood out. A Muslim, he was arrested in 2021 on charges of hurting religious sentiments of Hindus for a joke he didn't crack. He spent five weeks in jail before a court gave him bail .\nThree years on, the 32-year-old has won the popular reality programme, taking home a whopping 5m rupees ($60,160; \u00c2\u00a347,455).\nOn Monday, a sea of people gathered in Faruqui's neighbourhood Dongri - a Muslim ghetto just outside of Mumbai city - to welcome him, a kind of reception usually reserved for film stars. His name has been trending all week and social media is awash with his memorable one-liners from the show.\nNot everyone's happy though. An anchor of a popular Hindi TV channel said it was \"worrying, distressing and disappointing\" that the country, including millions of Hindus, was celebrating a comic who \"started his career by insulting Hindu gods and religion\".\nMany say the way Faruqui has reinvented himself from being among India's \"most hated\" young performers to a \"darling of the masses\" using unconventional ways deserves recognition.\n\"It imbued his life with an arc of struggle,\" says political scientist Asim Ali. \"He came out of jail, was subject to a vicious media onslaught but then returned to achieve a significant pan India level of celebrity.\"\nBut how did he do it? The answer lies in Faruqui's life itself.\nComing from a small city in the western state of Gujarat, Faruqui's childhood was beset with tragedies. His mother died by suicide when he was just a boy, his father faced violence during the deadly 2002 religious riots - the comic once said he was stuck at home for 12 days during a curfew. Like millions, he moved to Mumbai, the \"city of dreams\", in his teens to give life a chance, but had to do odd jobs for years before he could make it big.\nIn Bigg Boss, Faruqui didn't shy away from these realities but constantly embraced his underdog existence, speaking a language in which ordinary people dream.\n\"I couldn't have possibly said no to Bigg Boss, this fancy life and house,\" he teasingly tells other contestants.\n\"I come from Dongri. In Bigg Boss, you are thrown out if you don't get votes, but in our tiny house, you are thrown out if you move even an inch extra in your sleep.\"\nHis ability to easily connect with masses shone through even during his stand-up years.\nOn stage, Faruqui carried the air of a slightly bored college student with a dark sense of humour. His attitude veered from playful unconcern to cool indifference, as he told macabre jokes about surviving riots and poked fun at clich\u00c3\u00a9s and stereotypes about Muslims. He was an inconsistent performer, but could be thrilling when he got it right, his provocations amusing and unsettling at the same time. These qualities were also present in Faruqui's rap music, which he made on the side.\n\"I evoke my past to express how proud I feel about my growth. It's never for sympathy but just to tell people I have come this far,\" he once said.\nWhile his whimsy won him scores of fans, it couldn't protect him from what lay ahead. In 2021, he was kicking off a 14-city tour with a show in the central city of Indore when a leader of a local Hindu hardline group accused him of \"insulting\" Hindu religious sentiments. Faruqui and four others were arrested and charged with outraging religious feelings.\nThe case sparked massive outrage - eyewitnesses told reporters that Faruqui had not cracked any jokes relating to religion when he was picked up, and that he hadn't even started his routine when the show was interrupted. The police later also admitted they had no evidence that the comic had made the offending joke.\nYet, Faruqui spent 35 days in jail. After his release, he tried returning to comedy but dozens of his shows were cancelled following protests from Hindu groups. In December 2021, he announced he was quitting comedy. \"Hate has won, artist has lost. I'm done,\" he wrote in a poignant Instagram post.\nTwo months later, Faruqui decided to move in a new direction and participated in a reality TV show called Lock Up.  He described it as a \"cleanse\", an opportunity to rejuvenate his image and liberate from pre-existing assumptions. \"I never wanted to be controversial, they made me so. I was happy doing comedy,\" he told a newspaper.\nBut it was an odd choice. The show featured \"16 controversial celebrities\" who spent 72 days locked up in a rowdy mock jail and was hosted by Kangana Ranaut, a popular Bollywood actor who often makes headlines for her anti-Muslim comments.\nFaru",

    "Carl Andre was a highly influential artist, but his death this week has revived memories of two of art's most controversial episodes - one involving his \"pile of bricks\" sculptures, and the other surrounding the mysterious death of his wife.\nBefore he became infamous, Andre became famous for his pioneering ideas about what could be considered art.\nAfter moving to New York to fulfil his dream of becoming an artist, a breakthrough came when he met abstract painter Frank Stella.\nSeeing the uncarved side of a large beam of wood that Andre was working on, Stella remarked \"that's sculpture too\" - a moment Andre said changed his life.\nReverence and ridicule\nHe realised art could be reduced to industrial essentials - arranging simple rectangular sculptures from raw materials like bricks, steel, aluminium and cedar blocks.\nHe became regarded as one of the fathers of the minimalist movement. Andre \"rethought what sculpture traditionally was, how it worked\", New York Times critic Holland Cotter wrote in 2014 .\nBut ripping up the traditional rules of art was too radical for many.\nHis work caused an outcry in Britain in 1976 when it emerged that the Tate gallery had purchased his work Equivalent VIII - 120 bricks arranged on the floor - for \u00c2\u00a32,297, funded through taxpayer money.\n\"Each element has the same exact size, shape, and weight; they appear factory-produced, as though Andre had never touched them,\" wrote Alex Greenberger in ArtNews .\n\"What a load of rubbish,\" declared the Daily Mirror's front page headline. Outrage and debate raged in the press for days, with many seeing Andre's humble \"pile of bricks\" as irrefutable proof of the con of modern art.\nIt was also seized upon by politicians. \"Andre's sculpture\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 became the basis of an attack on Labour's cultural policy by the Conservative opposition,\" recalled The Guardian's art critic Adrian Searle .\n\"For a long time Andre's bricks - which became known as the Tate bricks - caused great controversy, generated newspaper headlines, febrile arguments and any number of cartoons and jokey photo-opportunities.\"\nThe divide between critical artistic pedigree and public perception continued in the US a year later, when the state of Connecticut bought an Andre work of 36 uncut boulders for $87,000. Hartford's mayor publicly denounced the purchase for bringing \"international ridicule\" on the city.\nBut a different, darker controversy was to surround Andre after his third wife, Cuban artist Ana Mendieta, fell to her death from their 34th floor New York apartment in mysterious circumstances in 1985.\nWhen he called 911, Andre told the emergency services the couple had been arguing about which of them was more famous. She went to the bedroom, \"I went after her, and she went out the window\", he said.\nBut when later questioned by the police, he told a different story. He said they had been watching TV together and she went to bed before him, but when he went to join her she wasn't there and the bedroom window was open.\nThe police noticed scratches on Andre's face and body. Friends recalled that she had spoken about being afraid of his temper, and being terrified of heights.\nWhen Andre went on trial for murder in 1988, a doorman testified to hearing cries of \"No, no, no!\" just before her body hit the ground. But prosecutors were prevented from introducing evidence that Mendieta was planning to divorce Andre because of his infidelity.\nHe did not testify, but his lawyers argued that his wife either fell accidentally or committed suicide. He was acquitted.\nIn the years after the trial, Andre continued to make and show his work, and be revered by many in the art world.\nBut the verdict left many others unconvinced, and his exhibitions became frequent targets of protests, with chants of \"Where is Ana Mendieta?\"\nAs Calvin Tomkins' 2011 New Yorker profile stated: \"It is hard to think of an artist whose career has been so affected by circumstances that have nothing to do with his art.\"\nMendieta's own reputation has belatedly grown in recent years, and Helen Molesworth's 2022 podcast Death of an Artist re-evaluated the court case and her treatment as a female artist through a post-#MeToo lens.\nAndre died on Wednesday at a hospice at the age of 88, while suffering from dementia.\nThe art remains.

    "Environmental protesters have thrown soup at the glass-protected Mona Lisa in France, calling for the right to \"healthy and sustainable food\".\nThe 16th Century painting by Leonardo da Vinci is one of the world's most famous artworks, and is held at the Louvre in central Paris.\nThe Louvre said the work was behind protective glass and was not damaged.\nVideo shows two female protesters wearing T-shirts that read \"food counterattack\" throwing the liquid.\nThey then stand in front of the painting, saying:  \"What is more important? Art or the right to healthy and sustainable food?\n\"Your agricultural system is sick. Our farmers are dying at work,\" they add.\nMuseum security are then seen putting black screens in front of them before the room is evacuated.\nA group called Riposte Alimentaire (Food Counterattack) claimed responsibility for the stunt.\nIn a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter, it said the protest was part of efforts to integrate \"food into the general social security system\".\nIt said that the current model for food \"stigmatises the most precarious and does not respect our fundamental right to food\".\nThe group called for a food card worth \u00e2\u0082\u00ac150 (\u00c2\u00a3128) to be given to citizens each month to be used on food.\nThe Louvre said that members of Riposte Alimentaire, which it described as an environmental movement, sprayed pumpkin soup on the painting at around 10:00 local time (09:00 GMT), and that there was no damage.\nIt said the Salle des Etats, where the work is displayed, was evacuated, and reopened to visitors at 11:30 after cleaning was carried out.\n\"The museum will lodge a complaint,\" it added.\nRachida Dati, France's Minister for Culture, said \"no cause\" could justify the Mona Lisa being targeted.\n\"Like our heritage [the painting] belongs to future generations,\" she said on X.\nThe French capital has seen protests by farmers in recent days , calling for an end to rising fuel costs and for regulations to be simplified - on Friday they blocked key roads in and out of Paris.\nThe Mona Lisa has been behind safety glass since the early 1950s, when it was damaged by a visitor who poured acid on it.\nIn 2019, the museum said it had installed a more transparent form of bulletproof glass to protect it.\nIn 2022, an activist threw cake at the painting , urging people to \"think of the Earth\".\nThe painting was stolen from the Louvre in 1911 , causing an international sensation. Vincenzo Peruggia, an employee of the world's most visited museum, hid in a cupboard overnight to take the painting.\nIt was recovered two years later when he tried to sell it to an antiques dealer in Florence, Italy.",

    "A London food bank says it has seen a three-fold increase in older people relying on it for help each week.\nBow Foodbank in Bethnal Green, east London, says it has had to change the way it provides services due to demand becoming \"unmanageable\".\nMeanwhile, charity Independent Age says many pensioners have reached \"breaking point\" due to the cost of living.\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said it was \"committed to supporting the most vulnerable\".\nBow Foodbank is open-access, which means people can turn up and access support without having to be referred by external services like doctors or social services.\nIts executive director Joanna Read said since she started working there a year and a half ago, the number of pensioners using their services has risen from 17 a week to up to 70 a week.\n\"At the same time as making sure they've got the food they need, it's really important that we think about making sure they've got access to all of that wider support as well,\" she added.\n\"We've done a lot of work with our pensioner groups, making sure they're referred into the local authority to look at pension credits, so they've got access to that longer, more sustainable help.\"\nIt is part of a wider picture of increased demand on the food bank, the organisation says.\nDuring its busiest week in 2023 about 1,000 households came through its doors and it spent between \u00c2\u00a316,000 and \u00c2\u00a320,000 on food and other essential supplies.\nWhile in 2022, its busiest week saw roughly 270 households using the service and a spend of \u00c2\u00a35,000 to \u00c2\u00a36,000.\nOther food banks in the community are increasingly serving older residents too.\nLen Edwards, 60, goes to the Good Shepherd Mission food bank in Bethnal Green every Monday.\nHe says he used to work as a teaching assistant, but in 2010 developed health issues and is now on benefits.\n\"It isn't just about food, it's about gas and it's about electricity, it's about rent - just day to day living,\" he said.\nHe added without the food bank's assistance he would \"find it very difficult financially being able to afford food\".\n'Breaking point'\nMorgan Vine, from Independent Age, a charity that supports older people facing financial hardship, said she was not surprised about the increase as \"pensioners on a low-income are at absolute breaking point\".\n\"The people we speak to aren't able to use their cookers, and are telling us that they can't afford to wash in warm water, so they're having to make really tough decisions,\" she said.\n\"I think that's one of the reasons more older people are going to food banks.\"\nThe situation in London is also being reflected nationally.\nRecent Trussell Trust figures showed the number of emergency three-day food parcels handed out to pensioner households in the UK increased by 36% in the April and September 2023 period compared with the same period in 2022.\nLondon is also the region with the highest number of people registered as using food banks, according to Trussell Trust.\nA DWP spokesperson said: \"There are 1.7m fewer people living in absolute poverty, including 400,000 children, compared to 2010.\n\"We are committed to supporting the most vulnerable households, which is why we are providing record cost of living support worth an average \u00c2\u00a33,700 per household.

    "Alabama has executed convicted murderer Kenneth Eugene Smith with nitrogen gas, the first time the method of capital punishment has been used globally.\nA witness told the BBC that Smith thrashed violently on the gurney and the execution took around 25 minutes.\nThe UN condemned it on Friday as cruel but Alabama said the process had been carried out humanely.\nSmith was convicted in 1989 of murdering a preacher's wife, Elizabeth Sennett, in a killing-for-hire.\nIn his final words, the 58-year-old said his death would mean Alabama had taken humanity \"a step backwards\".\nMike Sennett, the son of the victim, said the family wouldn't be celebrating but that Smith had paid his \"debt\".\n\"Nothing that happened here today is going to bring Mom back,\" he said, adding: \"We're glad this day is over\".\nAccording to the Death Penalty Information Center, Smith is the first person to be put to death using pure nitrogen gas anywhere in the world.\nThe execution began at 19:53 local time (01:53 GMT) and he was pronounced dead at 20:25 (02:35 GMT).\nAlabama and two other US states have approved the use of nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative method of execution because the drugs used in lethal injections have become more difficult to find, contributing to a fall in the use of the death penalty nationally.\n\"Tonight Alabama causes humanity to take a step backwards,\" Smith said, according to witnesses. \"Thank you for supporting me. Love all of you.\"\nAfter the gas began to flow into his mask, the inmate is said to have smiled, nodded toward his family and signed \"I love you\".\nOne of the five members of the media transported to Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore to witness the execution told the BBC it was unlike any other he'd witnessed in Alabama.\n\"I've been to four previous executions and I've never seen a condemned inmate thrash in the way that Kenneth Smith reacted to the nitrogen gas,\" Lee Hedgepeth told the BBC's Newsday programme.\n\"Kenny just began to gasp for air repeatedly and the execution took about 25 minutes total.\"\nBreathing nitrogen without oxygen causes cells in the body to break down and leads to death.\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey, who did not respond to a request to attend the execution, confirmed Smith's death in a statement.\n\"After more than 30 years and attempt after attempt to game the system, Mr Smith has answered for his horrendous crimes,\" she said.\n\"I pray that Elizabeth Sennett's family can receive closure after all these years dealing with that great loss.\"\nAttorney General Steve Marshall said it had proved to be \"an effective and humane method of execution\", refuting the \"dire predictions\" of activists and the media.\n\"Justice has been served,\" his statement added.\nAlabama corrections Commissioner John Hamm said Smith's shaking on the gurney appeared to be involuntary movements.\n\"That was all expected and was in the side effects that we've seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia,\" Mr Hamm said. \"Nothing was out of the ordinary from what we were expecting.\"\nAlabama said in an earlier court filing that it expected Smith to lose consciousness within seconds and die in a matter of minutes.\nSmith was one of two men convicted of murdering Mrs Sennett in a $1,000 (\u00c2\u00a3790) killing-for-hire in March 1988.\nThe 45-year-old was beaten with a fireplace implement and stabbed in the chest and neck, and her death was staged to look like a home invasion and burglary.\nHer husband Charles Sennett, a debt-ridden preacher, had orchestrated the scheme to collect insurance money. He killed himself as investigators closed in.\nSmith's fellow hitman, John Forrest Parker, was executed in 2010.\nAt his trial Smith admitted to being present when the victim was killed, but said he did not take part in the attack.\nThe jury that convicted him had voted in favour of a life sentence but the judge overrruled them and imposed a capital punishment. The law has been changed since to prevent a judge intervening like that.\nIn a statement, Smith's legal team said it was \"deeply saddened\" by his execution, noting that the jury in his case had voted to spare his life but a judge overrode that decision.\n\"Nothing can undo the tragic consequences of the actions for which he was convicted, including the pain of the Sennett family and friends,\" the attorneys said.\n\"Kenny's life, however, should be considered in its full context.\"\nEarlier on Thursday, the Alabama Department of Corrections shared details from the inmate's final 48 hours.\nSmith was visited by members of his family, two friends, his spiritual adviser and his attorney. His final meal was steak and eggs with hash browns.\nAlabama tried to execute Smith by lethal injection two years ago, but they were unable to find a vein before the state's death warrant expired.\nOn Thursday night, the Supreme Court denied him a last-minute reprieve. Three liberal justices dissented from the conservative-led majority's ruling.\u00c2\n\"Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its 'guinea",
    "Almost half a million households are now affected by a cap on some benefits, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank.\nThe two-child cap, which was introduced in 2017, restricts child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in most households.\nIt means families cannot claim about \u00c2\u00a33,200 a year per extra child, the think tank says.\nThe government says it is helping with the cost of living.\n'Everything has gone up'\nThe 2017 two-child benefit limit means most families cannot claim means-tested benefits and tax credits for any additional children born after this date.\nSeparately, more than 100,000 families are affected by the benefit cap, which limits the amount of support that out-of-work families can claim.\nMum-of-five Sophie says money is so tight that she regularly goes without in order to feed her children.\nHer toddler has a serious bowel condition so needs specialist products, such as incontinence pads, but he does not qualify for additional disability benefit.\n\"It does make me feel anxious. Sometimes it's between me eating dinner and his medical needs, and obviously I will always choose the children's needs over mine,\" she says.\nShe believes financial support should be capped at three or four children.\n\"Things are tight now because everything has gone up [in price]. There has to be a limit somewhere but I wish the government would look at each case individually - you can't judge a book by its cover.\"\n'Every month is a struggle'\nDanielle lives in Fulham, west London, with her four children, aged 12, five, three and seven months.\nShe says: \"I feel like they're looking at me and my children as numbers, not as people.\n\"To me, every month is a struggle. They need new trousers and new underwear, or they've broken something and I need to fix it, or we need new furniture.\n\"It's the same all year round, every month. I feel like I have to choose which child I'm going to buy something for each month. Who's going to get forgotten about this month? Who takes priority?\"\nThe charity Barnardo's, which has been supporting Danielle, argues that the policy is unfair.\n\"The two-child limit on benefits is one of the biggest policy drivers of child poverty,\" Barnardo's chief executive Lynn Perry says.\n\"The majority of families receiving universal credit are in work, and many are struggling for reasons beyond their control - such as a family break-up, the death of a partner, or someone losing a job amid the cost-of-living crisis.\"\nThe Resolution Foundation's research also suggests:\nFamilies hit by the limit can still claim child benefit, help with childcare costs and support for disabled children, if they meet the relevant criteria.\nSome are also affected by the benefit cap, which came into effect in 2013. It limits the amount of benefits most working-age households can receive, if they work fewer than 16 hours a week, with some exceptions.\n'I couldn't have pre-empted it'\nAlmost half of those affected by the two-child benefit limit are single parents, such as Frances, in London. Her third child was still a baby when her relationship with her husband broke down, and he doesn't support the family financially.\nHer children are now aged 11, six, and three. Frances has \"reluctantly\" left her job as a business administrator as she says it wouldn't cover the cost of childcare.\n\"I've heard the argument that you need to plan your family, but I did plan, thinking I was in a two-parent family unit.\n\"But through a breakdown in the relationship, we went from an average London family to me being a single parent and having to juggle those demands and responsibility, and then going to not having an income because of that - it's not anything I could have pre-empted.\"\n\"It's really tough. As items have become more expensive, you have the same needs but the costs are exorbitant.\"\nWhen the two-child limit is fully rolled-out in 2035 it is set to affect around 750,000 families. Scrapping the policy would cost about \u00c2\u00a33.6bn in today's prices by then and would lift about 490,000 children out of poverty, the report claims.\nThe government says it is helping families with the rising cost of living, including raising benefits by 6.7% last April, in line with inflation.\nIt adds there are 1.7 million fewer people living in absolute poverty - including 400,000 fewer children - compared with 2010.\n\"The two-child policy asks families on benefits to make the same financial decisions as families supporting themselves solely through work, and safeguards are in place to protect people in the most vulnerable circumstances,\" a Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said.",
    "Jurors in the trial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have for the first time seen images of their baby, whose body was later found in a shed.\nMs Marten, 36, and Mr Gordon, 49, are accused of the manslaughter of Victoria. They deny the charges.\nThe parents travelled across England in taxis after a placenta was found in their burnt-out car last January.\nIn one taxi journey, Mr Gordon \"slid down in his seat\" as a police car came towards them, the Old Bailey heard.\nColette Franklin, who took them from Harwich to Colchester, told police in a statement: \"I noticed at one point when a police car was coming towards us on the road that the male slid down in his seat.\"\nThe couple came to police attention when their car caught fire on the M61 near Manchester on 5 January 2023.\nThe prosecution say the couple were trying to avoid the authorities because their previous four children had all been taken into care.\nThey argue the couple fled, travelling in taxis from Liverpool to Harwich, then onto Colchester and London.\nThe pair left most of their possessions behind and a placenta was found in the vehicle wrapped in a towel.\nOn 27 February, they were arrested in Brighton after being spotted without the baby - whose body was found in a disused shed on 1 March.\nThe jury on Tuesday watched CCTV clips of the couple in Colchester and in East Ham in London.\nAt one point, Mr Gordon is seen going into a shop called Special Connection, and Constance Marten can be seen outside the shop.\nThe jury has heard a lot about the baby, but until now had only seen her as a bump under Ms Marten's coat.\nSuddenly in the court room, the baby was in full view on the CCTV wearing a white baby grow as Ms Marten adjusted her under her padded burgundy coat.\nMs Marten could be seen bobbing Victoria up and down as if to calm her.\nLater in a German Doner Kebab restaurant in East Ham, the baby girl can be seen moving her arms while Ms Marten assembles a buggy that Mark Gordon had just bought in Argos.\nThe couple then put the baby into the buggy in full view of the CCTV camera. The jury has heard that the couple dumped the buggy later that day. Mr Gordon sat in the dock and covered his face with his hand as the footage was shown in court.\nHis defence barrister, John Femi-Ola KC, spoke briefly to him and asked for a short break as his client was finding it \"quite stressful\".\nMs Marten has not attended court for her trial. The East Ham CCTV pictures were recorded on Saturday 7 January 2023 - two days after the couple's car caught fire.\nThe jury heard that from East Ham the couple headed to Whitechapel, where Mr Gordon bought a tent from another branch of Argos. They then headed to Haringey, north London, from where they took a taxi to Newhaven, Sussex.\nThey arrived there in the early hours of the morning of Sunday 9 January 2023.\nThree days later, on 12 February, Ms Marten was recorded on CCTV at a Texaco petrol station.\nBut after that \"the CCTV trail goes cold\" until February 20, Joel Smith for the prosecution told the jury.\nThat was when the prosecution say the couple were recorded by CCTV cameras rummaging in bins near a golf course clubhouse in Brighton. They were arrested in the city on 27 February.\nThe jury heard from two witnesses who say they saw the couple in Brighton before that.\nPaul Rogers, a dog walker, said he thought he saw them close to the Hollingbury Golf Course. He said he saw a black man and a white woman walking together pushing a buggy in a field.\n\"As I got closer to them, I noticed they looked a bit dishevelled, a bit dirty, possibly homeless people\", Mr Rodgers explained.\n\"The man was carrying plastic bags, a bag in each hand. The woman was pushing a buggy. It looked like a toddler's buggy.\"\nBut he said he did not see a baby. He said he thought the date was 16 or 17 February.\nTim Morris told the jury he was driving with his wife on Coldean Lane on 18 February when they saw a couple crossing the road in front of their car as they waited at some traffic lights.\nMr Morris explained: \"I said to my partner 'That looks like the couple that were in the news', and she said 'She's definitely got something under that coat. It may be a little 'un'.\"\nJohn Femi-Ola KC, for Mr Gordon, asked \"Could you be mistaken?\"\n\"Possibly yes,\" Mr Morris replied.\nBaby Victoria was found dead some eight weeks later in a Lidl \"bag for life\" in a shed in Brighton.\nAs well as manslaughter, the couple is also accused of four other offences - cruelty to their baby; concealment of the baby's birth; causing or allowing her death; and perverting the course of justice by concealing the body.\nThe trial continues.",
    "A police chief has warned the XL bully dog ban, which began overnight, poses \"logistical challenges\" for officers.\nMark Hobrough, from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), said the ban could spark higher demand for kennel space before court decisions.\nAn expert on dangerous dogs fears the ban will also compound an existing shortage of trained officers.\nThe government says police will be supported and officers given extra training to identify XL bullies.\nNew laws banning the breed in England and Wales take effect from Thursday.\nFor some months, owners have been able to apply for an exemption certificate if they can prove their dog had been neutered before a specific date.\nThey were also required to pay an application fee, hold liability insurance for their dog, and ensure it was microchipped.\nMore than 35,000 dogs are now registered for exemption but those owners without could face a criminal record and unlimited fine.\nThe RSPCA has said tens of thousands of XL bullies may not have certificates with the estimated total in the UK ranging from 50,000 to 100,000.\nXL bullies that are seized under the new law will be taken to kennels before a court decides they should either be destroyed or deemed safe.\nMr Hobrough, an assistant chief constable, said police forces were \"actively looking to enhance\" the numbers kennels can hold to cope with expected higher demand and \"logistical challenges\" for officers.\nThe government said ministers met police chiefs this week to discuss their preparations.\n'Something will have to give'\nDebbie Connolly, a dog behaviourist who acts as an expert witness in dangerous dog court cases, said she feared the ban would be difficult to enforce.\nShe said it would \"compound\" the existing problems caused by the small numbers of officers trained specifically on dog legislation, and a lack of kennel space.\n\"If officers are now told to go out and look for unmuzzled XL bullies, something will have to give,\" Ms Connolly told the BBC.\nThere are 137 dog legislation officers across the country, with at least one in every force.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for animal welfare, said these officers will be given extra training to help successfully identify the XL bully breed.\nMs Connolly said there had been an \"endless influx\" of people asking her training firm SafePets UK, for help over the last two or three weeks.\nShe said \"hundreds\" of pictures of dogs have been sent in and \"the worrying part is a good 90% of them we didn't think were XL dogs\".\n\"You have to wonder how many of the dogs exempted are actually XL bullies,\" Ms Connolly said.\nDr Elizabeth Mullineaux, from the British Veterinary Association, said the ban would not work as \"all dogs that are not well-trained, well-kept and well-socialised have the ability to be aggressive\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she reiterated calls for more resources and trained officers for the police.\n\"A lot of the really awful fatal attacks have actually been in people's houses,\" Dr Mullineaux added.\n\"What's happening today will not stop those because dogs won't be muzzled in people's houses.\"\nRadio presenter DJ Spoony, whose Xl bully dog Prince is nearly two years old, said he was sceptical at how effective the ban would be, adding he would prefer a licence system to ensure owners of all dog breeds did not mistreat them.\n\"Just to keep banning a particular breed is like kicking the problem down the road,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live .\n\"It's always going to come back to responsible owners. And as long as there are irresponsible owners, there will always be dog attacks.\"\nMr Hobrough, from the NPCC, said illegal XL bully owners must comply with officers as their behaviour may influence how the court decides the case.\nCourts look at whether both dogs and owners are aggressive and would have \"no option but to destroy the dog\" if either wasn't complied with, he said.\nOfficers who are met with resistance would take \"proportionate action with minimum use of force\" to seize dogs, Mr Hobrough added.\nThe government banned the XL bully after a rise in fatal dog attacks.\nBefore 2021 there were about three dog attack deaths per year but there have been 23 since, with the XL bully \"disproportionately involved\".\nIn September, Ian Price died after being attacked by two suspected American XL bully dogs in Stonnall, near Walsall, while Jack Lis, a 10-year-old boy, was killed by an American XL bully in Caerphilly in 2021 .\nEnvironment Secretary Steve Barclay said: \"We have delivered our pledge to bring in this important measure to protect public safety, and we expect all XL bully owners to comply with the strict conditions.\"\nRestrictions on XL bully dogs were announced on Wednesday for Scotland and will start to take effect from 23 February with exemption certificates needed from 31 July.\nA decision on whether to ban the dogs in Northern Ireland is expected shortly.\nXL bullies registered as exempt must be microchipped,",
    "Tuvalu is a group of nine tiny islands in the South Pacific which won independence from the United Kingdom in 1978.\nFive of the islands are coral atolls, the other four consist of land rising from the sea bed.\nFormerly known as the Ellice Islands, all are low-lying, with no point on Tuvalu being higher than 4.5m above sea level. Local politicians have campaigned against climate change, arguing that it could see the islands swamped by rising sea levels.\nLife on the islands is simple and often harsh. There are no streams or rivers, so the collection of rain is essential.\nCoconut palms cover most of the islands, and copra - dried coconut kernel - is practically the only export commodity. Increasing salination of the soil threatens traditional subsistence farming.\nTuvalu has shown ingenuity by exploiting another source of income.

The prime minister is chosen by MPs.\nMEDIA\nMedia freedom is respected in Tuvalu but the market is very small. The government operates Radio Tuvalu. Many islanders use satellite dishes to watch foreign TV stations.\nTIMELINE\nSome key dates in Tuvalu's history:\n14th century AD - Samoans, Tongans and settlers from other Polynesian islands migrate to the islands\n1568 and 1595 - Spaniard Alvaro Mendana de Neyra sights the islands of Nui and Niulakita on two separate expeditions.\n1819 - A ship owned by British MP Edward Ellice visits Funafuta. The captain names the island Ellice Island. Later this name was applied to all nine atolls.\n1850-75 - \"Blackbirding\" - the kidnapping of islanders for forced labour on plantations in Fiji and Queensland - and the introduction of European diseases reduces the population from 20,000 to 3,000. In 1863 Peruvian slave traders kidnap 400 islanders - nearly two-thirds of the population of the islands of Funafuti and Nukulaelae.\n1877 - Britain sets up the Western Pacific High Commission with its headquarters in Fiji. The Ellice Islands and other island groups come under its jurisdiction.\n1892 - Britain declares a joint protectorate over the Ellice Islands and the Gilbert Islands.\n1916 -The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony is formed. Over the next 20 years other island groups, including the Line Islands and the Phoenix Islands, join the colony.\n1974 - Ethnic tensions result in more than 90% of the mainly Polynesian Ellice Islanders voting for separation from the predominantly Micronesian Gilbert Islands.\n1975 - Ellice Islands become a separate British dependency, under the pre-colonial name of Tuvalu meaning \"eight standing together\" which refers to the eight populated atolls.\n1978 - Tuvalu becomes independent - the Gilbert Islands become independent at the same time, as Kiribati.\n1986 - Votes to remain an independent constitutional monarchy with the British monarch at its head.\n1989 - UN lists Tuvalu as one of a number of island groups most likely to disappear beneath the sea in the 21st Century because of global warming.\n2000 - Admitted to the United Nations.\n2001 - New Zealand offers to resettle islanders threatened by rising sea-levels. Tuvalu says it will take legal action, along with Kiribati and the Maldives, against the US for its refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n2008 - Tuvalu again votes to remain an independent constitutional monarchy with the British monarch at its head, though the referendum turnout is low - 21%.\n2022 - Amid rivalry between China and Taiwan for diplomatic recognition from Pacific states, Tuvalu's Prime Minister Kausea Natano reaffirms its commitment to Taiwan on a state visit to Taipei.\nTuvalu announces plans as the first country in the world to build a self-digital replica in the metaverse in order to preserve its cultural heritage in the face of rising sea levels.",

    "A Spanish court has cleared a British man of public disorder, after he joked to friends about blowing up a flight from London Gatwick to Menorca.\nAditya Verma admitted he told friends in July 2022: \"On my way to blow up the plane. I'm a member of the Taliban.\"\nBut he said he had made the joke in a private Snapchat group and never intended to \"cause public distress\".\nA judge in Madrid ruled that \"no explosive... was found that would lead one to believe it was a real threat\".\nMr Verma's trial, held at the National Court in the Spanish capital, took place on Monday - a year-and-a-half after the incident took place.\nThe message he sent to friends, before boarding the plane, went on to be picked up by UK security services. They then flagged it to Spanish authorities while the easyJet plane was still in the air.\nTwo Spanish F-18 fighter jets were sent to flank the aircraft. One followed the plane until it landed at Menorca, where the plane was searched.\nMr Verma, who was 18 at the time, was arrested and held in a Spanish police cell for two days. He was later released on bail.\nA judge ruled earlier that Mr Verma, of Orpington, Kent, should be cleared of any wrongdoing.\nIf he had been found guilty, the university student faced a fine of up to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac22,500 (\u00c2\u00a319,300) and a further \u00e2\u0082\u00ac95,000 in expenses to cover the cost of the jets being scrambled.\nA key question in the case was how the message got out, considering Snapchat is an encrypted app.\nOne theory, raised in the trial, was that it could have been intercepted via Gatwick's Wi-Fi network. But a spokesperson for the airport told BBC News that its network \"does not have that capability\".\nIn the judge's resolution, cited by the Europa Press news agency, it was said that the message, \"for unknown reasons, was captured by the security mechanisms of England when the plane was flying over French airspace\".\nThe message was made \"in a strictly private environment between the accused and his friends with whom he flew, through a private group to which only they have access, so the accused could not even remotely assume... that the joke he played on his friends could be intercepted or detected by the British services, nor by third parties other than his friends who received the message,\" the judgement added.\nIt was not immediately clear how UK authorities were alerted to the message, with the judge noting \"they were not the subject of evidence in this trial\".\nA spokesperson for Snapchat said the social media platform would not \"comment on what's happened in this individual case\".\nOn its website, in a section titled \"How We Work with Law Enforcement Authorities\" , Snapchat says one of its goals is to \"maintain a safe and fun environment where Snapchatters are free to express themselves and stay in touch with their real friends\".\nIt adds: \"We also work to proactively escalate to law enforcement any content appearing to involve imminent threats to life, such as school shooting threats, bomb threats and missing persons cases, and respond to law enforcement's emergency requests for disclosure of data when law enforcement is handling a case involving an imminent threat to life.\n\"In the case of emergency disclosure requests from law enforcement, our 24/7 team usually responds within 30 minutes.\"\nAdditional reporting by Laura Gozzi and Monica Soriano",

    "A judge in the US state of Delaware has annulled a $55.8bn (\u00c2\u00a344bn) pay deal awarded to Elon Musk in 2018 by the electric car company Tesla.\nThe lawsuit was filed by a shareholder who argued that it was an overpayment.\nJudge Kathaleen McCormick found Tesla directors, who negotiated the pay package, were \"perhaps starry eyed\" due to Mr Musk's \"superstar appeal\" and did not fully inform shareholders.\nShe said the deal was \"unfathomable\" and ruled it should be cancelled.\nThe pay deal was the biggest ever in US corporate history, helping to make Mr Musk the richest person in the world. Bloomberg and Forbes estimated his net worth to be between $198bn (\u00c2\u00a3162bn) and $220bn (\u00c2\u00a3180bn), in November 2023.\nTesla's package tied Mr Musk's compensation to performance targets, such as Tesla's share price and profitability, but he does not receive a salary.\nTesla shareholder Richard Tornetta felt the tycoon was being overpaid. Despite owning just nine Tesla shares he launched legal action calling for the award to be rescinded. He said shareholders were not given enough information about how easily Mr Musk's performance goals would be achieved.\nFollowing years of legal argument, a week-long trial commenced in November 2022 where Tesla directors argued the huge pay award was designed to ensure that Mr Musk, one of the world's most dynamic entrepreneurs, would continue to dedicate his attention to the company.\nAs well as being the chief executive and a major shareholder of Tesla, Mr Musk owns several other companies, including the social media platform X, the rocket company SpaceX, and the brain chip firm Neuralink, dividing his time between them.\nBut in her 201-page ruling released on Tuesday, Judge McCormick said that incentivising Mr Musk was not the main reason for the oversized pay package. Rather, the Tesla directors had been \"swept up by the rhetoric\" surrounding the often controversial chief executive, she said.\nMoreover, Mr Musk had \"extensive ties\" with members of Tesla's compensation committee, she said, citing his 15-year business and personal relationship with committee chair, Ira Ehrenpreis.\nMr Musk was also \"close friends\" with another committee member, Antonio Gracias, with business dealing stretching back two decades, she said.\nBoard members James Murdoch and Linda Johnson Rice were not on the compensation committee but were found to have been involved in the process.\nThe judge said Mr Murdoch had became a friend of Mr Musk's after he purchased a Tesla Roadster in 2006 or 2007. The pair took family holidays together to Israel, Mexico, and the Bahamas.\nJudge McCormick noted Mr Musk along with his brother Kimbal, who also sits on Telsa's board, recused themselves from \"most of the meetings and all of the votes on the 2018\" pay package.\nBut she said five of the six directors who voted on the pay package \"were beholden to Musk or had compromising conflicts\".\nShe also said many of the documents the Tesla directors cited as proof of a fair process were \"drafted, pushed out, or endorsed\" by Todd Maron, Mr Musk's divorce-attorney-turned-general-counsel. His \"admiration for Musk moved Maron to tears during his deposition,\" she noted.\n\"The Compensation Committee and Musk were not on different sides. They did not acknowledge the existence of a conflict. It was a cooperative and collaborative process,\" she wrote.\nFollowing the release of the ruling, Greg Varallo, an attorney for the Tesla shareholder Mr Tornetta, said it was a \"good day for the good guys,\" in an email reported by the Reuters news agency.\nMr Musk responded to the judgement with a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nIt said: \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware\".\n\"I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,\" he added.

    "A \"very rare\" air weapon made by 18th Century gunsmith George Wallis has sold for \u00c2\u00a31,500 at auction.\nThe muzzle-loading rifle was designed to fire multiple shots using compressed air rather than gunpowder.\nThe weapon, which was sold on Friday, had been expected to fetch \u00c2\u00a3200 - \u00c2\u00a3400.\nScarborough-based auctioneer Will Duggleby said air weapons were \"immune\" to the weather, unlike those fired using gunpowder.\nWallis, from Hull, was \"one of the most renowned\" gunmakers in the country during the 1700s, Mr Duggleby added.\nAccording to Scarborough-based auctioneers David Duggleby the gun was made in the late 18th or early 19th Century.\nDescribing the weapon as \"striking-looking\", Will Duggleby said it had a walnut stock, with a 34-inch rifled barrel.\n\"To use it, the reservoir is removed and filled with compressed air using a hand pump before being re-attached for firing,\" he said.\n\"It is a very, very rare gun; not least because just a few years after it was made, a Scottish clergyman invented percussion ignition and that made other systems obsolete overnight.\"\nHowever, Mr Duggleby said Wallis, in his day, had been at the very forefront of technology.\n\"The matchlocks and flintlocks of the 16th and 17th centuries were pretty primitive - slow, noisy, inaccurate and prone to failure in wet weather,\" he said.\n\"Experiments had proven it was possible for guns to be powered by compressed air rather than gunpowder.\n\"Not only could air guns be just as effective but they were also quicker to use, capable of multiple shots before the air ran out and immune to weather conditions.\"\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) , and Instagram .

    "Mollie Pearce might have fallen at the final hurdle of The Traitors and lost the \u00c2\u00a395k prize, but the model and healthcare assistant finds some comfort in what she achieved in opening up on her \"double whammy\" of disability - limb difference and living with a stoma.\n\"I call my stoma Sid,\" Mollie makes clear on the BBC's Access All podcast . \"I'm very proud of Sid. He's helped me in a lot of ways.\"\nSid the stoma came into Mollie's life just a few years ago when she was 18 (she turned 22 on Sunday, 48 hours after the epic TV final).\nMollie had been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis aged 11. The autoimmune condition causes inflammation in the large intestine triggering ulcers and debilitating pain.\nIt came to dominate her teenage years stopping certain basic activities and the number of school days missed.\n\"When I was suffering with ulcerative colitis I couldn't be away from a toilet,\" she says.\nAged 18 she underwent \"massive\" surgery to have her colon removed and her small intestine diverted out of an opening in her abdomen known as a stoma.\n\"That colons in the bin,\" she says theatrically. \"Now, my small intestine sticks outside of my stomach and I have a stoma bag over the top, which collects my waste.\n\"I would never have been able to do the missions in the middle of a field or the middle of a loch. So actually having a stoma bag is the best thing I've ever done.\"\nListen to the Access All podcast with Mollie Pearce from The Traitors , and spot the moment when the tables turn and Michael starts to interview Access All's blind presenter , Emma Tracey, about her experiences...\nIt was something the Bristolian opened up about in the penultimate episode of this year's series when the final five were enjoying a celebratory dinner.\n\"I really struggled to get my head around the fact that I was going to have a stoma,\" she told her fellow finalists. \"I wasn't prepared for it. Eighteen-years-old, you kind of want to be out enjoying yourself with your friends, not having this life changing surgery.\"\nShe says it felt right to open up at that point in the game.\n\"We'd got to the final and we were just celebrating. It just made me realise how far I'd come from  that girl who was so unwell and couldn't leave the house.\"\nAn energetic island hopping trip around Greece two summers ago with her boyfriend, had given Mollie the confidence to take up the offer of appearing on The Traitors and take on the physical challenges including swimming and climbing, while wearing a stoma bag.\n\"I loved the physical missions,\" she says. \"They were such a good break from all the mind games and it was a really good bonding experience. Sid's given me the kind of option to do these things.\"\nIn terms of the practicalities, Mollie says she didn't need any extra support throughout the series, and she got into a good routine. She changed her bag every three to four days and emptied it whenever she visited the loo.\nHaving ulcerative colitis was something going on inside her body whereas she has a much more visible impairment too.\nShe says living with an invisible illness has been much harder to explain to people than her limb difference on her right hand. Without the visual evidence she has found people often think \"you look so healthy but, really you are suffering so much.\"\nAs well as working as a hospital healthcare assistant in Bristol, it was Mollie's limb difference which landed her a glamorous side hustle - what she describes as \"disability modelling\".\n\"I saw a model in Primark who had one arm and I'd never seen a disability model before,\" she says.\n\"The way that model made me feel in that moment\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I was like 'that is how I want to be for other people'.\"\nMollie was initially signed as a model with limb difference, but now she is very comfortable showing off Sid too.\n\"It's a double whammy,\" she jokes. \"Who doesn't want someone with one hand and a stoma bag?\"\nShe says the reaction from her sto-mates, people who also have stomas, to her being on the show and modelling has been \"amazing\".\n\"It can be a bit of a taboo and I think it's super important that we do advocate for it, especially when it comes to younger people.\"\nMollie says it was a \"strange\" time between finishing filming The Traitors and it coming out on TV - a gap of several months.\n\"You have this crazy experience and this massive adventure and then that's it. I was back working as a healthcare assistant at the hospital and you obviously can't talk to anyone about it.\"\nAt that point she was still coming to terms with the treachery Harry Clarke had served her, and which the nation had yet to see.\nHarry - one of the original three traitors - and, faithful, Mollie were the last players standing, after both voted to eliminate faithful Jaz Singh.\nIn the final moments of the series, Mollie had started to write Harry's name down for banishment, before changing her mind and voting for Jaz, leaving just her and Harry standing.\nHer decision meant Harry won all \u00c2\u00a395,150 of the prize money - as if any ",

    "From Thursday, people will be banned from keeping American XL bullies unless they get an exemption after the dog was listed as a dangerous breed in the wake of fatal attacks on humans. Shelters say they have seen a huge increase in XL bullies being handed in or abandoned. The BBC has been speaking to owners, experts and victims about the ban.\nBailey gives an excited jump, eager to keep the game of fetch going with his owner Danielle Thomas.\nThe 18 month-old fawn coloured XL bully is in an enclosed field Danielle has hired for his use near their South Tyneside home.\nA DNA test has revealed Bailey is 74% American Staffordshire terrier, 16% American pit bull terrier, 3% Staffordshire Bull Terrier and the rest a mix of other bull type breeds.\nHe is kept muzzled and on a lead when outside the paddock or his home, not that he needs it from a safety perspective, Danielle stresses, but to \"protect him\" should anyone make any complaints.\nShe and her family got Bailey in June and they have found him to be \"absolutely brilliant\". They took him in after a friend had to give him away as he was getting picked on by their other dogs.\nHe is one of the more than 30,000 dogs to have been granted an exemption to the XL bully ban, meaning he must be neutered, be kept muzzled in public and his owners must have third party liability insurance.\n\"I don't think banning them is the right way about it,\" Danielle says, adding: \"The dogs should be judged on what they have done.\"\nAttacks and deaths are \"absolutely heartbreaking,\" she insists, but she blames the owners, especially those who get such large dogs as a status symbol.\n\"Yes they are strong dogs,\" Danielle says. \"In the wrong hands they can cause damage but if you bring them up in a loving home and care for them, they do treat you with the same respect.\"\nElaine Atkinson from Cleator Moor has experienced the worst side of XL bullies.\nHer beloved pet Rox was viciously mauled by five dogs, including two XL bullies, a lurcher and a terrier, while on a morning walk in Cleator Moor, Cumbria, in March 2023.\nThe attack was started by one of the XL bullies which clamped on to Rox's neck and only came to an end when a man from a nearby industrial unit hit the attackers with a stick.\nElaine bruised her hand punching the nose of the XL bully gripping her dog, but it made no difference.\n\"I might as well have been hitting him with a feather,\" she says, adding: \"It was horrendous.\"\nVets initially did not think Rox would survive her injuries, which included broken ribs and fractured lungs, but mercifully she pulled through.\nElaine is a self-confessed dog-lover but says she is now \"petrified\" of XL bullies. She signed the petition calling for them to be banned because \"something had to be done\".\nThe government agreed with the campaigners and announced a ban set to come into force on 1 February.\nWhile many XL bully owners have applied for exemptions, others decided to give away or abandon their dogs, according to the Association of Cat and Dog Shelters, which represents 166 centres across England and Wales.\nSince the ban was announced in September, some 377 XL bullies have either been handed in or picked up as strays by the association's shelters.\nSome are struggling to cope, according to association board member David Bowles, who said: \"It's hugely problematic.\"\nJane Gailliford, from Maxi's Mates shelter in Guisborough, says November was their busiest ever month for strays and surmised worried owners had \"just let them go\".\nShe is opposed to the ban, saying: \"It's not a bad dog, it's a bad owner\". She is especially haunted by the rule that any XL bully handed into a shelter must be put to sleep if its owner is not found within seven days.\n\"It's disgusting,\" Jane says. \"That's not what we set up to do, we don't put a dog down.\"\nShe says she and her staff will refuse to comply with the order and a dog warden will have to organise taking any dog to a vet to be put to sleep.\n\"It's like blood on our hands,\" Jane says, while David adds euthanising dogs would be \"traumatic\" for shelters.\nJane also says there is confusion over what an XL bully actually is, which is adding to worries.\nThe breed is not recognised by the UK Kennel Club, the country's official kennel club and the oldest in the world, and there is a checklist of criteria a dog must match to be classed as an XL bully .\nCorrect classification is a concern shared by dog owner Andrea Jane Taylor from Penshaw near Sunderland, whose dog Winston shares some of the features of an XL bully but is not one.\nShe fears the negative reaction he might get in public, adding he is a \"gentle giant\".\nThe ban has come after a spate of attacks.\nSince 2019 there have been 29 recorded deaths following an attack by a dog, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nThirteen of those were in 2023 and, while the government does not currently record the breed of dog, an increasing number have been attributed to dogs suspected to be XL bullies.\n'Responsible owner",

Malaysia has a rotating monarchy - King Abdullah Ahmad Shah passed the reins to Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar on Wednesday.\nThe reduced sentence sends a message that leaders in South East Asia act with impunity, said James Chin, professor of Asian Studies at the University of Tasmania.\n\"If you reach a certain level in your career, nothing can happen to you,\" Prof Chin told the BBC.\nHe said the leak of the pardons board's decision appeared to be an attempt to manage possible public outrage.\nNajib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which previously led the ruling coalition that governed Malaysia, has been pushing for a royal pardon after testing and exhausting other legal avenues of appeal.\nTwo weeks ago, Najib was escorted from prison by guards to appear in a Kuala Lumpur court to hear his latest legal challenge. Along with his wife Rosmah Mansor, he still faces a raft of other charges.\nDespite the huge damage to his reputation done by the 1MDB scandal, and revelations about his role in it, Najib remains popular among grass-roots UMNO supporters, many of whom benefitted from the largesse he offered ethnic Malay communities when he was running the country. He managed to solidify that support with a slick PR campaign even after he was charged, with the slogan Bossku (Your Boss).\nNone of the UMNO leaders who have replaced him enjoy the same popularity, so they needed to be seen to be trying to get him out. Najib's party is not the force it was, but it is still one of the largest parties in Malaysia and a part of the governing coalition headed by his old nemesis Anwar Ibrahim. It is not so surprising then to see its wishes being accommodated.\nWhat is the 1MDB scandal?\nThe 1MDB scheme was a global web of fraud and corruption, in which billions of dollars ostensibly raised for public development projects in Malaysia instead landed in private pockets, including Najib's .\nFugitive financier Jho Low , who is wanted by Malaysian authorities, is said to have been the mastermind behind the scheme. The country's anti-corruption body said last year that he is believed to be in Macau.\nThe case centres around the 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a sovereign wealth fund set up in 2009, when Najib was prime minister.\nSovereign wealth funds are government-owned investment entities that are used to boost a country's economic development. Built with state earnings, such as revenues from oil resources and exports, they have extraordinary flows of cash to invest and potentially enormous international clout.\nIn 2015, questions were raised around 1MBD's activities after it missed payments owed to banks and bondholders.\nMalaysian and US authorities allege that $4.5bn was illicitly plundered from the fund and diverted into private pockets.\nThe missing money has been linked to luxury real estate, a private jet, Van Gogh and Monet artworks purchased by Low - and even a Hollywood blockbuster, the Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.\nLast week, US bank Goldman Sachs reached a $3.9bn settlement with the Malaysian government for its role in the multi-billion-dollar corruption scheme.\nThe deal resolved charges in Malaysia that the bank misled investors when it helped raise $6.5bn for 1MDB.\nwith reports from Jonathan Head",
    "Edinburgh is a growing city with a congestion problem.\nThe volume of traffic has bounced back from the pandemic in a way that public transport use hasn't.\nThe city council has previously set a target of reducing car use by 30% before the end of the decade.\nThe question is - how can it do that?\nThis week, the City of Edinburgh Council launched bold plans for its future.\nFuture Streets - a circulation plan for Edinburgh set out a reworking of how space is allocated on the city's streets, focusing on neighbourhoods, key transport corridors and the city centre.\nThe city's transport convener favours what he called a stick and carrot approach.\nCouncillor Scott Arthur says Edinburgh is lagging behind other big cities and has a moral duty to meet its climate obligations.\nOpponents say have questioned whether the council's ambition outstrips its budget.\nHere are the five biggest things that have got people talking in the city.\nCity centre traffic ban\nOne proposal is to stop vehicles travelling through the city centre.\nThe council stressed it wouldn't be a complete ban - exemptions would apply for things like business deliveries and cars could still access the restricted area.\nThe idea, they say, is to re-route general traffic around some of the capital's most famous streets like the Grassmarket and parts of the Royal Mile where pedestrians would be given priority.\nCouncil officers are considering whether to follow the \"big bang\" approach taken in the Belgian city of Ghent where similar restrictions were introduced over a single weekend.\nAs a first step the Cowgate will be closed to traffic this year and will not re-open if the experiment is deemed to be a success.\nThe campaign group Living Streets says the plans would make for safer, more pleasant streets but has warned against simply shifting congestion elsewhere.\nThat concern is reflected in the modelling showing that public transport delays on Lothian Road would increase by 40% if city centre restrictions were introduced.\nCritics of the plan - which would also include late night and weekend parking restrictions - say it reinforces the council's \"anti-car\" agenda.\nImproved bus service\nNearly two million passengers use the bus and tram in Edinburgh every week.\nIncreasing that number at the expense of using the car is central to the council's strategy.\nAn illustration of that lies in the plans to build a housing development \"the size of Falkirk\" near Edinburgh airport by the end of the decade.\nOn that route council officers say an extra 55 buses an hour would be needed to properly connect people with the city centre.\nMore generally all-day, seven-day-a-week bus lanes are among the measures being considered with the aim of improving journey times by 25%.\nEdinburgh Council had earmarked a share of \u00c2\u00a3500m of Scottish government bus priority funding but that investment, announced in 2019, has now been paused.\nDescribing that decision as \"a hammer blow\", transport convener Scott Arthur says they'll now explore alternative ways of delivering improved bus services - \"a must\" he insists before consideration is given to revisiting an old idea.\nCongestion charging?\nIn 2005 Edinburgh residents voted overwhelmingly to reject a proposal to introduce a \u00c2\u00a32 charge for driving into the city. Nearly 20 years on, the basic concept is once again on the lips of councillors.\nBut the transport convener says the move away from fuel duty could present an opportunity to introduce a \"pay as you drive\" alternative.\n\"It would be much more focused on vehicles coming into Edinburgh from surrounding local authorities where the drivers were choosing not to use a viable alternative to public transport,\" said Mr Arthur.\n\"It's a stick to encourage people to take advantage of the carrot of better public transport which would be there.\"\nHowever, he says the prospect of road pricing in Edinburgh is still years away and would be contingent on improvements to public transport.\n\"It would be immoral for us to charge people for coming into the city by car when there's no viable alternative in place for them right now.\n\"We need that investment in place first and then we'll follow up with a congestion charge if it's needed.\"\nTram extension\nAnother proposal involves a project with a chequered past.\n\"A litany of avoidable failures\" were responsible for the original line being delivered years late and vastly over budget according to Lord Hardie's public inquiry.\nEdinburgh Council insists the tram extension to Newhaven completed successfully last year shows that lessons have been learned.\nNow a further extension is being proposed that would connect Granton in the north of the city with Edinburgh Royal Infirmary in the south.\nThe proposals are at an early stage but current estimates suggest it could take around 10 years to complete at a cost of \u00c2\u00a32bn.\nThat's considerably more expensive than earlier phases of the project which raises the question of who pays?\nEdinburgh Council is hoping for considerable support from",

    "A Kenyan court has dealt a blow to the government, rejecting its appeal against a temporary block on a controversial housing tax .\nIn November, the High Court found that the 1.5% monthly levy unfairly targeted Kenyans working in the formal sector and ordered payments to halt.\nOn Friday, the Court of Appeal ruled that citizens should stop paying the tax until the case is decided.\nThe government had wanted to carry on collecting the tax in the meantime.\nPresident Ruto has vowed to press ahead with the project regardless, claiming to have public support that was tantamount to an endorsement from God.\n\"Your say is God's say. So I have enough directive and I will push this housing programme forward,\" he told people at a public rally in Meru County, central Kenya, on Friday.\nKenya's government had begun deducting 1.5% of the gross salaries of locals and foreigners last July, to fund construction of affordable houses for low-income earners.\nThe levy sparked an outcry from the opposition and a large section of Kenyans, who feel burdened by the raft of taxes introduced under President William Ruto.\nThe government had argued that suspending the levy would render thousands of workers under the housing programme jobless and breach contracts that had already been signed.\nMany Kenyans are relieved by the judgement, although the Court of Appeal is yet to make its final decision.\nThe ruling comes a week after the appeals court gave the go-ahead for a controversial healthcare insurance levy, which will require people to contribute 2.75% of their monthly salaries to a social healthcare programme.\nThe housing levy case is one of the petitions that have created a rift between the judiciary and executive, with President Ruto accusing allegedly corrupt judges of colluding with the opposition to sabotage national development projects.\nFriday's ruling was one of two on the same day to go against the government. The High Court also ruled that Kenya could not send police officers to Haiti , to tackle gang violence there.\nYou may also be interested in:",

    "England's hedgerows would stretch almost ten times around the Earth if lined up end to end.\nThat's according to a new map - the most comprehensive to date - of these historic features of the landscape.\nEcologists hope the data will lead to better protections for the much-loved lines of trees and shrubs that provide food and shelter for wildlife, and store large amounts of carbon.\nLaser scanning from the air reveals a total of 390,000 km of hedges.\nThe South West boasts the most hedgerows, led by Cornwall.\nSurrey, Hampshire and Berkshire are the counties with the least - excluding big urban areas.\n\"We've probably got more hedgerows in England than anywhere else in the world so we're very lucky to have this huge resource,\"  said Dr Richard Broughton of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, who led the project.\n\"As a national policy, we're trying to expand hedgerows in this country, and this will tell us where there are gaps in the hedgerow network that we could fill in.\"\nHedgerows have been part of the rural fabric of Britain since the Bronze Age, marking out boundaries and keeping in cattle.\nThey contain hundreds of different wild plants, provide shelter for nesting birds, small mammals and insects, and can capture and store large amounts of carbon.\nAbout half of Britain's hedgerows were lost between the 1940s and 1990s, mostly in England, due to intensive farming and development\nWhile the loss has slowed since the 1990s, neglect, damage and removal remain big threats.\nThe new map is based on aerial laser scanning of England's entire landscape using Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) remote sensing data.\nPrevious analyses have relied on estimates scaled up from field surveys.\n\"This is the first time we've been able to map with Lidar the whole country, which means that you don't have to walk every hedgerow,\" said Dr Broughton.\n\"You can just do a sample of it and then scale up from there. This gives us more detail than we've had before on such a large scale.\"\nThe new data calculates there are 390,000 km of hedgerows in England measuring between 1 and 6 metres in height.\nAdditionally, there are another 67,000 km of lower hedges and a further 185,000 km of overgrown hedges above 6m tall.\nThe map found:\n\u00c2\u00a0The government has promised to create or restore\u00c2\u00a048,000 km of hedgerows by 2037, and 72,000 km of hedgerows by 2050, under the new Environmental Improvement Plan released a year ago.\nFollow Helen on X @hbriggs.",

    "Only two states have chosen which Republican they want to take on Democratic President Joe Biden but it's almost certain to be Donald Trump. It's an election campaign being watched not just in the US but around the world.\nAfter recently spending a few weeks in Europe, the subject of America's presidential election was a constant topic of intense curiosity and concern among the people I spoke to. And no wonder.\nThe US is currently involved in two hot wars, Ukraine and Gaza. Meanwhile, US-China relations have deteriorated and tensions in the Asia Pacific region have risen.\nCloser to home, Central American nations are under the spotlight as a growing number of migrants are trying to get to the US through a border which seems more porous by the day. And this week there were US-led air strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nThere is almost no area of the world where American leadership doesn't matter.\nThe prospect of Republican Donald Trump returning to office, with his America First foreign policy agenda, adds more uncertainty to an already tumultuous picture.\nSome countries look forward to his return. But many of America's allies are more fearful about the possible comeback of an unorthodox president they found hard to deal with the first time around.\nDemocratic Senator Chris Coons, who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee and is also co-chair of President Biden's re-election campaign, told me that in every meeting he's had with foreign leaders or foreign secretaries, at some point they raise the question of whether American voters could really turn once more to President Donald Trump.\nSo, while this may be a US election, other countries are deeply invested in the result.\nIn no capital in the world are they watching this campaign as closely as they are in Kyiv. The fate of the war arguably depends on the outcome.\n\"If the policy of the next president - whoever he is - will be different toward Ukraine, colder or more inward-oriented\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 then I think these signals will greatly affect the course of the war,\" President Volodymr Zelensky said recently.\nHe didn't name names but Mr Trump has said he would end the war \"in 24 hours\" of being elected, although he hasn't explained how. The Ukrainians are concerned he would push for negotiations that wouldn't favour their cause.\nThat would go down well in Russia, where the media has been particularly supportive of Trump, and some have criticised efforts to remove him from the ballot in 16 US states.\nThe Kremlin-controlled channel NTV was scathing. \"This is real meddling in the election and the undermining of democracy by Americans themselves. No Russians or Chinese would even dream of this,\" NTV correspondent Anton Ponomaryov told viewers, with no hint of irony.\nThe implications of a shift in US policy would be felt beyond Ukraine's border and would particularly worry those European states that neighbour Russia.\nFurther afield, other American allies may decide the US is not a reliable security partner. One US senator raised the prospect of Japan developing its own nuclear arsenal if America stops helping Ukraine. Tokyo, he told me, could decide the American nuclear security umbrella simply has too many holes in it.\nThere's also the prospect that a re-elected President Trump would act on his desire to pull America out of Nato, effectively crippling the military alliance. Two people with ties to the Trump campaign have told me he does plan to do just that.\nEuropeans, says Senator Coons, are right to be anxious.\n\"The US and its European allies have a significant common challenge. Together we have to show the world that Putin can't outlast us and that [Chinese] President Xi's vision of authoritarianism is not the best for the world.\"\nMore on the US election\nThe other hot war, the conflict in the Middle East, has clearly shaken up US politics in different ways - younger Americans and Arab Americans so oppose the White House's support for Israel that Joe Biden could even lose a state because of it in the election.\nBut the reaction of Israelis to US politics is perhaps even more surprising. Israelis used to favour Trump over Biden by large numbers, but a December 2023 poll by the Midgam group showed a dramatic shift in support towards President Biden.\nA survey of Israeli media shows the paradox isn't lost on Israelis that their newfound love of Joe Biden may hurt his chances of being re-elected. The business daily Calcalist carried the headline \"Biden's support for Israel strengthens Trump ahead of the elections.\"\nOther Middle Eastern countries may welcome a change in Washington, however.\nDuring the 2020 campaign, for example, Joe Biden called Saudi Arabia a pariah state. Then months into his presidency a disastrous US pull-out from Afghanistan has the Taliban firmly in control.\n\"I do think our Middle Eastern partners would universally prefer a Republican president to Biden,\" says Matthew Kroenig, a former US defence department official who now works at the Atlantic Council th",

Five homes are empty.\n'Huge upheaval'\nMr Swords said the news was \"absolutely devastating\" for those living there, but the situation had been an issue since initial inspections were carried out in December 2020.\n\"The latest advice is that in order to bring them to potentially safe standard - but there's no guarantee - we would have to spend in excess of \u00c2\u00a35.5m,\" he told the BBC.\n\"That means a bill to leaseholders of more than \u00c2\u00a3110,000 each, and that's to just bring it to safe standard, not to improve the blocks.\n\"I don't think anyone would argue that that's a sensible use of money, so we're looking at what to do next.\"\nThe council has said any works would cause huge upheaval and it would be \"more cost effective to move people out and demolish the buildings\".\nWork carried out on the blocks since 2020 included a full fire detection system, new stores for recycling bins and closing the car parking under the flats.\nHaving a person watch the flats 24/7, to alert residents and assist with an evacuation was running up a bill of \u00c2\u00a34,000 a week, the council added.\n'No guarantee'\nInvestigations of vacant homes revealed the entire wall system and structure would need upgrading, the council explained, with work further complicated by the presence of asbestos.\nIf the report is approved, residents would be supported and given financial compensation, with tenants given the highest priority for other council homes, the council said.\nMr Swords said he appreciated it was a difficult and unsettling time for residents, who had been informed of the plans.\n\"We have carried out works in other flat blocks and tower blocks in the town, but the situation at Sycamore Field is unique and we must now decide what to do,\" he added.\n\"Independent specialists are telling us that we will need to spend well over \u00c2\u00a35.5m on further works, which will deliver no other improvements to the look or energy efficiency of the buildings.\n\"There is no guarantee that these works will adequately protect the block and that further work won't then be required.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologised to families who say their children had been harmed by social media, during a fiery hearing in the US Senate.\nMr Zuckerberg - who runs Instagram and Facebook - turned to them and said \"no-one should go through\" what they had.\nHe and the bosses of TikTok, Snap, X and Discord were questioned for almost four hours by senators from both parties.\nLawmakers wanted to know what they are doing to protect children online.\nLegislation is currently going through Congress which aims to hold social media companies to account for material posted on their platforms.\nWednesday's hearing was a rare opportunity for the US senators to question tech bosses.\nMr Zuckerberg and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew voluntarily agreed to testify - but the heads of Snap, X (formerly Twitter) and messaging platform Discord initially refused and were sent government-issued subpoenas.\nBehind the five tech bosses sat families who said their children had self-harmed or killed themselves as a result of social media content.\nThey made their feelings known throughout, hissing when the CEOs entered and applauding when lawmakers asked tough questions.\nWhile the hearing mostly focused on the protection of children from online sexual exploitation, the questions varied widely as the senators took advantage of having five powerful executives there under oath.\nTikTok - which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance - CEO Mr Chew was asked whether his company shared US users' data with the Chinese government, which he denied.\nUS Senator Tom Cotton asked Mr Chew, who is from Singapore, if he had ever belonged to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\"Senator, I'm Singaporean. No,\" Mr Chew replied.\nMr Cotton then asked, \"Have you ever been associated or affiliated with Chinese Communist Party?\"\nMr Chew responded: \"No, senator. Again, I'm Singaporean.\"\nHe added that as a father of three young children he knew the issues under discussion were \"horrific and the nightmare of every parent\".\nHe admitted his own children did not use TikTok because of the rules in Singapore which bar under-13s from creating accounts.\nBut it was Mr Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta, who came under the most scrutiny, as he testified before Congress for an eighth time.\nAt one point, Republican Senator Ted Cruz asked, \"Mr Zuckerberg, what the hell were you thinking?\" when he showed the tech boss an Instagram prompt that warns users they may be about to see child sexual abuse material, but asks if they would like to \"see the results anyway\".\nMr Zuckerberg said the \"basic science behind that\" is \"it's often helpful to, rather than just blocking it, to help direct them towards something that could be helpful\". He also promised to \"personally look into it\".\nDuring another exchange with Republican Senator Josh Hawley, Mr Zuckerberg was invited to apologise to the families sitting behind him.\nHe stood up, turned to the audience and said: \"I'm sorry for everything you've all gone through, it's terrible.\n\"No-one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.\"\nSenators frustrated at lack of progress\nAt the heart of the hearing was the companies' attitudes to the online safety legislation currently going through Congress.\nThis was summed up in a tense exchange between Jason Citron of Discord and Republican lawmaker Lindsey Graham.\nMr Graham listed a number of bills going through Congress related to online safety, asking if Mr Citron supported them or not.\nWhile Mr Graham gave Mr Citron little opportunity to respond, the Discord boss appeared to have reservations about most of them.\nMr Graham concluded: \"So here you are - if you're waiting on these guys to solve the problem, we're gonna die waiting.\"\nAhead of the hearing, Meta had announced new safety measures , including that minors will now, by default, be unable to receive messages on Instagram and Messenger from strangers.\nSocial media industry analyst Matt Navarra told the BBC he thought the hearing resembled many similar showdowns, with \"lots of US political grandstanding\" and a perfect photo opportunity provided by Mr Zuckerberg's apology.\nHe added that despite senators agreeing on the need for bipartisan legislation to regulate platforms, the question of what happens next remained unclear.\n\"We've seen these hearings time and time again and they have often, so far, led still to not actually generate any significant or substantial regulation,\" he said.\n\"We're in 2024 and US has virtually no regulation, as was pointed out during the hearings, with regards to the social media companies.\"\nThe bosses also revealed how many people they employed to moderate content on their platforms.\nMeta and TikTok, with the largest user numbers of the platforms represented, said they had 40,000 moderators each, while Snap said it had 2,300, X had 2,000 and Discord - who said it was smaller - had \"hundreds\" of moderators.\nDiscord is a messaging platform and has previously been questioned over how it detects and pre",

    "Peter Navarro, former trade adviser to Donald Trump, has been sentenced to four months in prison and a $9,500 (\u00c2\u00a37,500) fine for contempt of Congress.\nNavarro was convicted in September after he ignored a subpoena from a House committee investigating alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\nFederal prosecutors said he \"chose allegiance to former President Donald Trump over the rule of law\".\nNavarro has filed an appeal and vowed to take the case to the Supreme Court.\nProsecutors had asked that Navarro, 74, serve a six-month sentence. His lawyers claimed he was \"not an insurrectionist\" and requested that he serve no jail time.\nNavarro was served with a subpoena by a US House of Representatives select committee in February 2022.\nBut he did not hand over any of the requested emails or documents or appear to testify before the Democratic-led panel.\nWhen contacted by the committee, Navarro said Mr Trump had instructed him to cite executive privilege. This is a legal principle that allows certain White House communications to be kept under private.\nBut the judge ruled that there was no evidence that Mr Trump could have requested that, or that executive privilege could have permitted Navarro to ignore the committee's summons.\nHe was found guilty by the 12-member jury after four hours of deliberations, following a trial in Washington DC last year that lasted two days.\nAddressing the court on Thursday, Judge Amit Mehta said he had a \"great deal of respect\" for Navarro, adding that it is \"disappointing how he behaved\".\n\"It's those kinds of statements from somebody who knows better \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that contribute to why our politics are so corrosive. It is regrettable.\"\nThe judge also noted the work Navarro did with US businesses to speed up production of Covid-19 protective equipment during the pandemic, saying \"I do think the country owes you a debt of gratitude to you for your work with the coronavirus\".\nIn his 2021 book, In Trump Time, Navarro said he was the architect of a strategy to challenge the 2020 election results, claiming widespread voter fraud.\nThe plan was for congressional Republicans to delay certification of President Joe Biden's victory.\nThe House committee said Navarro's claims of massive ballot fraud had been exposed as baseless by state and local officials.\nNavarro, addressing the judge, said he was \"disappointed\" that he was not permitted to raise an executive privilege defence.\n\"The minute that violence erupted on Capitol Hill was one of the worst moments of my life,\" he said.\nJudge Mehta said that Navarro's actions sought to thwart \"a significant effort by Congress to get to the bottom of a terrible day in the country's history\".\n\"They had a job to do and you made it harder. It is really that simple,\" he added.\nNavarro, speaking to reporters after his sentencing, said he was \"caught in a battle between two competing branches of government\", referring to Congress and the White House.\nHe called his case \"destined for the Supreme Court\", saying it should decide \"whether a senior White House aide and alter ego of the president can be compelled to testify by Congress\".\nHis case has parallels with another Trump aide who was convicted of defying the 6 January committee.\nFormer Trump campaign strategist Steve Bannon was convicted of two counts of contempt for refusing the House committee's legal summons in July 2022.\nBannon was also sentenced to four months in jail, but has remained free while his defence team appeals against the conviction.",
    "A Russian-Belarusian rock band with anti-war views that had been touring Thailand is under threat of being deported back to Russia, activists say.\nHuman Rights Watch has urged the Thai government not to deport Bi-2, who have been criticised by Moscow, saying the seven members face persecution.\nThe band was arrested for unauthorised shows while touring Phuket, a resort island that hosts hundreds of thousands of Russian tourists.\nThey are in detention in Bangkok.\nBut Thai authorities are yet to comment on the case publicly or respond to the BBC's questions.\nA statement on the band's official Facebook page said they were facing deportation after being found guilty on 26 January of performing a gig without the correct permit. It said they had paid a fine for the breach.\nBut some of their supporters responded to the post, alleging the band had been targeted: \"Russian authorities found an excuse to detain them.\"\nThe band says in their statement: \"outside pressure played a significant role in our detention. We know that the reason for this pressure is [retaliation] for our creativity, our views, our position.\"\nThe band has also alleged that they could not understand the legal process with Thai police and courts, having not been provided adequate translation services.\nOf the band's seven members, some are dual citizens of Australia and Israel, so they could be deported to those countries. But activists warn that at least two members  only have Russian citizenship and could be sent back there.\nRussian authorities are yet to comment on the band's situation and have not said if they sought their deportation.\nBut the band has been singled out by Russian lawmakers before for their \"anti-Russian stance\".\nIn May 2023, Russia's justice ministry labelled the frontman Yegor Bortnik a \"foreign agent\" for \"opposing\" Russia's invasion of Ukraine and \"making negative statements\" about Russia, its citizens and authorities.\nThe band had been touring outside Russia since 2022, including playing shows across Europe last year.\n\"They've been inconvenient for [the] Russian government for a while because they are a very big band and they are very obviously anti-war and anti-Putin. So they moved out of the country a while ago,\" a friend of one of the band members, Marjana Semkina, wrote on Facebook.\nThailand and, in particular, its desirable island holiday spots such as Phuket have seen a huge influx of Russian tourists since the war began in Ukraine two years ago.\nMany Russians have fled the country to avoid conscription. By some estimates, nearly half a million Russians arrived in Phuket in the first half of 2023.\n\"If Thai authorities send them [Bi-2] back to Russia to face danger and persecution, it would be the first case under [Prime Minister] Sretta's government,\" Human Rights Watch's senior researcher Sunai Pasuk told the BBC.\n\"The Thai PM promised that his government will adhere to the principle of human rights so this is a crucial test.\"\nIt would also be the first case of the Thai administration forcibly returning a Russian national to Russia since the war began.\nAnd it would be a breach of Thai domestic law preventing torture and enforced disappearances, as well as Thailand's obligations under international laws against torture.\nBangkok is a signatory to the UN Convention against torture, meaning it has an obligation not to return people to places where they face the risk of persecution.\nWith additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone",

Financial records showed Bower sent her about \u00c2\u00a36,000 over six years.\n'Dangerous individual'\nNCA officers found additional chat logs where Bower encouraged others to sexually abuse young children and identified a woman in Romania who had been abusing a child under the age of two, as directed by Bower.\nShe was convicted of rape and child abuse in 2019 and jailed for more than eight years.\nThe NCA said Bower also contacted children via Skype, encouraging them to send him naked photos and perform sexual acts on camera. Two girls from the US, 8 and 15, were identified as having been coerced by Bower into sending indecent images.\nThe NCA said Bower admitted 15 offences including causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and making over 1,700 indecent images of children between 2008 and 2017.\nJen Cruickshank, NCA senior investigating officer, said he was a \"dangerous individual\", adding: \"He actively sought people online - both adults and children - whom he could coerce into sending him abuse material for his sexual gratification.\"\nShe paid tribute to the victims and said the first victim's report had enabled others to be safeguarded.\nBower was sentenced to 13 years and six months imprisonment and will serve an additional six years and six months on licence.\nHe was given a lifetime sexual harm prevention order and placed on the sex offenders register for life.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on Twitter , and on Instagram .

    "An ex-employee of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) has accused the company's boss, Vince McMahon, of sexually trafficking her to entice wrestling talent.\nJanel Grant says she was also sexually assaulted at WWE, in a case filed at a Connecticut district court on Thursday.\nMr McMahon's spokesperson said the case was \"replete with lies\" and his client would \"vigorously defend himself\".\nIn 2022, he stepped back as WWE's chair and CEO amid sexual misconduct claims.\nHe was reinstated as chair of WWE a year later, after the company had concluded an investigation into the allegations.\nWWE is the world's largest and best-known wrestling company - last week it signed a deal with Netflix to allow pro-wrestling's most popular weekly show, WWE Raw, to be exclusively streamed from January 2025. The programme has been shown on broadcast TV around the world for 31 years.\nIn the new legal case , Mr McMahon is named as a defendant alongside the WWE's former head of talent, John Laurinaitis.\nFormer WWE employee Janel Grant accuses them both of trafficking her to other men \"as a sexual pawn to entice world-famous wrestling talent\".\nShe says she was pressured into a physical relationship with the WWE chief executive in exchange for promises of employment, alleging she felt trapped \"in an impossible situation... submitting to Mr McMahon's sexual demands or facing ruin\".\nShe says she was unemployed at the time and dealing with her deceased parent's bankruptcy.\nAccording to the legal case, Ms Grant went on to work at WWE's headquarters in Connecticut between 2019 and 2022.\nShe accuses Mr McMahon of recruiting individuals, including John Laurinaitis, to have sexual relations with her during that time. He \"expected and directed Ms Grant to engage in sexual activity at the WWE headquarters, even during working hours\", the case document reads.\nShe also accuses both defendants of sexually assaulting her at WWE headquarters in June 2021.\nThe BBC could not reach Mr Laurinaitis for comment, and he did not respond to a request from the Wall Street Journal to comment on Thursday.\nMs Grant alleges Mr McMahon pressured her into resigning from WWE and signing a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for a lump sum of $3m (\u00c2\u00a32.5m) after his wife found out about their relationship in 2022.\nNDAs, also known as \"gagging orders\" or \"hush agreements\", are contracts between employees and companies preventing staff from making information public.\nMs Grant is asking the court to invalidate the NDA under federal law, claiming the defendants had violated the Trafficking Victims Prevention Act. She is also seeking unspecified monetary damages.\nWWE's parent company, TKO Group Holdings, said in a statement: \"Mr McMahon does not control TKO nor does he oversee the day-to-day operations of WWE.\"\n\"While this matter pre-dates our TKO executive team's tenure at the company, we take Ms Grant's horrific allegations very seriously and are addressing this matter internally,\" it added.\nBack in 2022, the WWE board announced an investigation over an alleged $3m (\u00c2\u00a32.5m) settlement between Mr McMahon and an ex-employee with whom he had a consensual affair.\nThe 78-year-old was replaced as acting chief executive and chairperson by his daughter. In January 2023, he returned as WWE chairperson after the investigation ended.\nIn Thursday's legal filing, Ms Grant called the WWE's special committee investigation \"a sham\" and accused the company of attempting to \"sweep the matter under the rug\".

    "MPs from constituencies with large Sikh communities have met Security Minister Tom Tugendhat to discuss safety concerns of their constituents.\nEarlier this month, it was reported that several supporters of an independent Sikh homeland were warned that there were threats to their lives.\nOne MP said concerns were widespread among British Sikhs, including among those who were not activists.\nSikh groups blame India. There has been no official confirmation.\nFears have been growing following global incidents relating to Sikh activists.\nIn September, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that there were credible reasons to believe the Indian state was involved in the death of a Sikh activist outside a gurdwara in a Vancouver suburb.\nThe Indian government also strenuously denied the accusations.\nThen in November, US prosecutors said an Indian agent had been behind an unsuccessful plot to kill a Sikh separatist in New York.\n\"This is really serious information,\" says Preet Kaur Gill, the MP for Birmingham Edgbaston who led the group that met the Security Minister.\nMs Gill says the concerns are widespread among British Sikhs - including among those who are not involved in activism.\n\"I am getting lots of people coming to my constituency who travel back and forth to India saying, 'we're really worried in a way I've never ever been worried before',\" she said.\n\"What the Sikh community is rightfully seeking is assurances that threats are being dealt with swiftly and very, very seriously by this government.\"\nThe eight MPs at the meeting urged the security minister to clarify what kind of police protection the activists whose life is deemed in danger should receive, and raised the case of Avtar Singh Khanda, a Sikh activist who died suddenly in Birmingham last spring.\nMr Khanda had been investigated by Indian intelligence services after he took part in a protest in front of the Indian High Commission in London.\nHis family says that he had been threatened before his death, and that his relatives in India had been harassed by the police.\nWest Midlands Police concluded that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Mr Khanda's death. His family has called for an inquest.\nMs Gill says she asked the security minister to visit the local community to explain what had been done to look into the matter.\nA spokesman for the government told the BBC that it \"continually\" assesses potential threats in the UK, and that it took \"the protection of individuals' rights, freedom, and safety in the UK seriously\".\n\"The UK is proud of its diverse communities, and British Sikhs contribute immensely to the strength of our society,\" it added.\n- additional reporting by Sara Monetta",
    "New plans for a privately funded alternative to HS2's now-scrapped Birmingham to Manchester section will be presented to the transport secretary next week.\nBirmingham's mayor Andy Street told the BBC that he and Manchester mayor Andy Burnham will meet with Mark Harper to discuss bringing in the private sector.\nMr Street said the plan could involve a dedicated line between the cities.\nBut he said it was \"highly unlikely\" to be exactly the same as HS2.\nIn October, the Prime Minister announced the parts of high speed rail line linking the West Midlands to Manchester, and to the East Midlands, would be cancelled.\nRishi Sunak also said HS2's key new station at Euston would only be built if private investment was secured.\n'Improving connectivity and reliability'\nSpeaking to the BBC at the official launch of construction at HS2's Birmingham Curzon Street station, the West Midlands mayor said the proposed alternative route would run between where HS2 ends in Handsacre, north of Birmingham, and south Stockport, where the Northern Powerhouse Rail begins.\nNorthern Powerhouse Rail is a rail project which plans to speed up links between Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds.\nHS2 trains are currently expected to continue north to Manchester after Handsacre on existing conventional tracks.\nMr Street said options being considered were \"maybe a dedicated line, maybe upgrades to the existing line\". The aim would be to relieve the \"very very congested\" West Coast Mainline, improving connectivity and reliability.\nBut he said it would be unlikely to be exactly the same as HS2 as the project was so over budget.\nMr Street confirmed the research he had done into alternative rail improvements was being done with the prime minister's approval. He gave no further details of the plans and said they were in their early stages.\nThe mayors announced in December they had started a group involving private sector firms to look at options to tackle the rail route between the Midlands and the North.\nThe group, chaired by infrastructure expert Sir David Higgins, would look at \"the cost, capacity, and economic uplift of changes to the rail route, helping to identify packages of potential interventions and potential private sector funding models and solutions,\" a press release at the time said.\nHS2: End of the line?\nWatch on BBC iPlayer how the story of HS2 unfolded.\nAvailable now on BBC iPlayer (UK only)\nThe transport secretary said yesterday he would \"listen with an open mind\" to what the mayors came up with. He cautioned that he was \"somewhat sceptical\" the private sector could deliver without any cost to the taxpayer.\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"We have already cancelled HS2 Phase 2 and we're getting on with delivering our Network North plan - this hasn't changed.\"\nMr Harper recently lifted \"safeguarding\" of land along the now-cancelled HS2 route between the West Midlands and Crewe.\nIt is not the same as selling back land or property, but means the land is no longer earmarked for HS2.\nLand near Handsacre will still be protected, which is where a connection will be built linking HS2 to the main line, on which HS2 trains will now travel on to Manchester using conventional tracks.",

    "The US has approved plans for a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials have told the BBC's US partner CBS News.\nThe strikes will take place over a number of days, officials said, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched.\nIt comes after a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday.\nThe US blamed an Iranian-backed militia group for that attack.\nThat group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards force. It has said it was responsible for Sunday's strike.\nIran, meanwhile, has denied any role in the attack which injured 41 other US troops at the military base, known as Tower 22.\nUS officials have said that US intelligence believes that the drone used to attack the facility was manufactured by Iran - and is similar to the drones Iran has been sending to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\nAt a news conference on Thursday, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the delayed military response, saying: \"We will respond where we choose, when we choose and how we choose.\"\n\"I think everyone recognises the challenge associated with making sure that we hold the right people accountable,\" he said, adding that there is no \"set formula for doing this\".\n\"There are ways to manage this so it doesn't spiral out of control. And that's been our focus throughout,\" Mr Austin continued.\nThe officials who spoke to CBS News did not give an exact timeline on the potential strikes. They said the US military could launch them in bad weather, but preferred to have better visibility to reduce the risk of inadvertently hitting civilians.\nPresident Joe Biden has been under mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers, including some of Washington's most hawkish voices on Iran, to strike targets on Iranian soil.\nBut while the US has repeatedly pledged to respond to the drone attack, Mr Biden and other defence officials have said Washington is not seeking a wider war with Iran or an escalation of tensions in the region.\n\"That's not what I'm looking for,\" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House earlier this week.\nThe reportedly approved plans appear to keep the targeting to Iranian targets Syria and Iraq, rather than inside Iran.\nSeveral Iran-backed groups have increased attacks on US and Israeli-linked entities since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October.\nThe Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, for example, have attacked ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, prompting strikes from the US and its allies.\nA US defence official told CBS that a drone was shot down overnight in the Gulf of Aden, while an unmanned sea drone was struck and destroyed in the Red Sea.\nCiting unnamed sources, Reuters on Thursday reported that Iran had withdrawn senior officials from Syria following a series of Israeli airstrikes in a bid to avoid being directly drawn into a wider conflict in the region.\nUS officials told CNN this week that there were signs that the Iranian government was becoming increasingly concerned about the actions of its proxy groups in the region, who have launched over 160 attacks on US forces since October.\nThe bodies of the three US soldiers killed in the attack in Jordan are expected to be repatriated to a Delaware Air Force base on Friday. The White House has announced that President Biden will attend.\nThe three soldiers have been named as William Jerome Rivers, 46, Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23.

    "Italy has summoned Hungary's ambassador after images of an Italian woman in shackles appearing at a Budapest court sparked public and political outrage.\nIlaria Salis, a 39-year-old primary school teacher from Monza, near Milan, appeared in court on 29 January with restraints on her hands and feet.\nShe is accused of taking part in violent assaults against neo-Nazi sympathisers in February 2023.\nA series of attacks took place in the wake of a neo-Nazi rally in Budapest.\nAlleged far-left militants were suspected of assaulting several people following the yearly \"Day of Honour\" rally - a far-right commemoration of Nazi troops in besieged Budapest during World War Two.\nA video showing anti-fascist activists kicking and beating a Hungarian, who is lying on the ground, has circulated widely in Hungary. The assailants are not identifiable.\nTwo German nationals were arrested alongside Ms Salis soon after. One pleaded guilty and was handed a 3.5 year sentence.\nMs Salis, who is charged with conspiracy to commit assault causing grievous bodily harm and faces 11 years in jail if convicted, has pleaded not guilty.\nThe prosecutor has claimed she and the other accused came to Hungary expressly \"to carry out rapid attacks which could cause serious injury against people believed to be far-right.\"\nAlthough Ms Salis has been in jail for almost a year, her case only began to attract attention in October after her father, Roberto, publicly spoke out about a letter in which his daughter reported the harsh conditions of her detention.\nLater, in an interview with Italian newspaper Repubblica, a former cellmate of Ms Salis reported she was intentionally being held in a cell \"full of rats and insects\".\nInterest in the case increased on Monday when images of a shackled Ms Solis in court were widely shared by Italian media. An online petition asking for Ms Salis to be brought back to Italy has so far gathered more than 90,000 signatures.\nOn Tuesday, Antonio Tajani, the Italian foreign minister, said he had summoned the Hungarian ambassador in Rome \"to ask why some of the most fundamental norms on conditions of detainees were not respected\".\n\"I believe the security measures adopted were excessive, this time,\" Mr Tajani told Italian media.\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - who heads the right-wing nationalist Brothers of Italy party and is a a close ally of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban - has not yet commented on the case, but is being urged by parties across the board to intervene.\nFive Star Movement leader Giuseppe Conte wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"Giorgia Meloni, we don't care that Orban is a good friend of yours - you have to be determined and raise your voice. The rights and dignity of Italians comes before friends and political allies.\"\nEugenio Losco, one of Ms Salis' lawyers, told the BBC that the scenes from court were \"a clear violation of the European Convention on Human Rights that states that no-one can be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\".\nMr Losco also said that Ms Salis stated that she hadn't been shown the video that allegedly puts her at the scene of the beatings, and she had not been shown a translation of the documents with the alleged evidence against her.\nThe Hungarian prison service pushed back against allegations of unsanitary conditions, which it said were false, adding that \"hygiene checks are constantly carried out in the institutions and prisoners receive proper medical care\".\n\"The presence of rats is a lie and prisons meet high hygiene standards,\" it added.\nPrisons in Hungary are overcrowded and short-staffed, according to the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group. Its September 2023 report lists a litany of complaints including bedbug infestations, cold, regulations which forbid exercise in cells, insufficient hot water and poor food.\nAndras Kadar of the Helsinki Committee told the BBC that although Hungarian prison authorities \"routinely use physical restraints when presenting detained defendants before the court... this is not only a breach of domestic legal principles, but is also in violation of the standards of the European Court of Human Rights.\"\nThe case - which is dominating headlines in Italy and is also being followed with interest in Hungary - is beginning to resonate elsewhere in Europe, too.\n\"This is very concerning,\" Juan Fernando L\u00c3\u00b3pez Aguilar, president of the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, told the BBC. \"Seeing such a medieval scene in the court of an EU state is just appalling.\"\nMs Salis's lawyer said that it was \"quite difficult to be optimistic\" about the outcome of the trial and accused Hungary's judiciary system of being \"highly repressive\".\nMr Losco added that his client should be allowed to spend their pre-trial detention in Italy, pointing out that EU law allows citizens to be held on house arrest in any member country of which they are a resident.\n\"I do not understand why this is not being grante",
    "MPs in the Czech Republic have approved an amendment tightening gun legislation, a month after the worst mass shooting in the country's history.\nThe amendment - which was proposed before the killings - must still pass through the senate and be signed by the president, and will not come into force until 2026.\nIt's far from revolutionary. So would it even have made a difference?\nWhen a 24-year-old graduate student with a history of depression shot dead 14 people at Charles University in December, he did so as a licenced gun user with eight legally-owned weapons.\nPolice believe his victims - students and staff - were killed with a pistol, but the shooter was also carrying an AR-10 semi-automatic assault rifle.\nThat gun became a symbol of the attack when he was captured on video with it, roaming the balustrade of the Arts Faculty and taking potshots at passers-by, injuring several.\nMoments later he threw the rifle down to the cobbled pavement and turned yet another weapon - a shotgun - on himself.\nIt later transpired he had acquired seven of the weapons in quick succession in the spring of 2023. No-one questioned the purchases; he had no criminal record and he held a valid gun licence.\nNo alarm bells were rung, nor could they be. There is no central control mechanism to warn the police that someone is amassing an arsenal.\nThe gun licence had also been acquired relatively recently - and easily.\nThe application has to be signed by a doctor, but they are unlikely to have known about the man's reported history of psychiatric problems. These would have been treated by a psychiatrist with no legal obligation to inform the doctor of them.\nThe legal amendment - proposed long before the shooting - could close some of these loopholes. It envisages a revamped online register of both guns and their owners. Doctors - including psychiatrists - should have access to it.\nGun shops will be legally required to report purchases they deem suspicious. The system should also flag people acquiring numerous weapons.\nPolice will also be given greater powers to seize weapons as a precaution before any offence has been committed.\nBut there will still be no mandatory psychological tests to obtain a gun licence, as is common in other countries. Czech doctors can - but do not have to - request them before signing the form.\nThere may be further amendments toughening up the legislation on its journey through parliament. But they are almost certain to leave untouched the fundamental right to carry a weapon in the first place - an odd obsession in one of the safest countries in Europe.\nIn 2021, the Czech Constitution was amended to include the right to bear arms in self-defence after a massive petition campaign that was prompted by EU moves to limit the possession of weapons, including legal ones.\nThere are now more than 300,000 licenced gun owners - and more than a million guns - in the Czech Republic, a country of 10.7 million people.\nThe Czechs are a nation of deer and wild boar hunters - not to mention biathlon fans. But the vast majority of licences are granted for personal protection, not for hunting or competitive shooting.\nWhy they need them for the streets of Prague and Brno is unclear.",

    "Actor Idris Elba says there is no \"one size fits all\" answer to tackling knife crime, after victims' families urged mandatory jail terms for possession.\nDr Sinead O'Malley, whose daughter was killed in Nottingham last year, has called for compulsory prison sentences.\nElba said deterrents were crucial, but that some people carry knives out of fear.\nIt comes as the government announced plans to close \"a legal loophole\" to ban the sale of zombie knives.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Elba said many young people - usually young men - carry knives because they are scared, because they have been stabbed themselves, or have seen someone else stabbed.\n\"He's walking through a neighbourhood, and thinks I'm going to protect myself here - he ends up in jail for five years. You wonder, are we winning?\", The Wire and Luther actor asked.\nElba added that a deterrent to make young people know they will pay a penalty for carrying a knife is important - but argued there are \"gradients\" to the issue.\n\"As a deterrent it's a really important step to consider, but it's not one size fits all,\" he said.\nElba, a prominent campaigner on knife crime, said that in tackling the issue it was important for the experiences of young people not to be overlooked.\n\"We do not want to criminalise these people without offering them an opportunity to feel safe, to feel that their whole community is involved,\" he said.\nIn a highly emotional interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Dr O'Malley, a consultant anaesthetist, said carrying a knife was \"no different\" to carrying a gun.\nShe said: \"I believe there has to be mandatory prison sentences for carrying a knife.\n\"It is not just an offensive weapon or something you could eat your food with. It is a lethal weapon.\"\nIn the same interview, her husband, Dr Sanjoy Kumar, a GP, described knife crime in England as an \"epidemic\" and said existing legislation on the issue appeared \"easy-going\".\nOn Thursday, the government is planning to introduce a new law further clamping down on zombie-style knives by closing what it describes as a legal loophole.\nPrevious attempts to ban the weapons defined them as having a cutting edge and a serrated edge and \"images or words that suggest that it is to be used for the purpose of violence\".\nBut the new law will also ban zombie knives with no threatening words or images, the Home Office said.\nThis is the government's third attempt at banning the weapons since 2016.\nA new definition was added in 2019 covering \"cyclone knives\", with two spiralled blades.\nThe new rules are being introduced to Parliament on Thursday, although they will not take effect until September.\nAmendments to the Criminal Justice Bill will also:\nThe latest police-recorded crime figures for England and Wales show that offences involving knives or sharp instruments increased by 5% to 48,715 in the year ending September 2023 - but they remained 5% lower than the year ending March 2020, at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nHome Secretary James Cleverly said the proposed new law would support the work the government has \"already done to make possession of zombie knives illegal and to close this loophole.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Policing Minister Chris Philp said the new law would cover zombie-style knives and machetes that were not covered by the previous legislation.\n\"It would be illegal to import, to sell or to possess - even in private, like your house - the knives that are being banned today,\" he said.\nMr Philp added that, from April, police will also increase \"hotspot\" patrols in areas where they believe there is a high risk of knife crime.\nHe also said the government hopes to introduce technology in 2025 that will scan people for knives in public places.\nElba, 51, called this a \"step in the right direction, but said more needs to be done to ensure the weapons are removed from the streets.\n\"I think that there is some critical thinking that needs to be done about how we actually implement this ban,\" he said.\n\"I am still going to fight for youth services to be bolstered, a lot more thinking between the services - the police, the hospitals and the education services - having a real round-table coalition to figure out how we intervene,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Labour is focusing on a programme of action plans for young people caught with a knife, which could see them subject to curfews, tagging or behavioural contracts.\nThe Young Futures programme - first announced at the party's conference in the autumn - would spend \u00c2\u00a3100m a year on new youth workers in accident-and-emergency departments and community mental-health hubs.\nShadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said Labour wanted to include knife crime as part of a \"sentencing review\".\n\"We're really concerned that there are too many young people who are not actually getting any intervention at all,\" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that \"empty warnings\" were not good enough.\n\"You've got to have urgent action to prevent re-offending, to prevent these offences getting w",

    "A boy who put his foot between a 62-year-old man's legs and shoved him to the ground - causing a brain injury and heart attack that killed him - has been detained after admitting manslaughter.\nThe then 16-year-old tripped up Jerald Netto and pushed him to the ground in Hanwell, west London in 2023.\nNow 17, he has been handed a 24-month detention and training order.\nMr Netto's family said they had been made to feel his death \"wasn't worthy of justice\".\nSentencing the youth at the Old Bailey, Judge Rebecca Trowler KC said the seriousness of the offence meant custody was \"the only option\".\nShe said the boy must serve 12 months in a young offenders' institution, after which he would be subject to 12 months of supervision in the community.\nShe added Mr Netto was \"entirely blameless\" in the incident and his death had \"caused unthinkable pain and sorrow to those who loved him\".\nMr Netto's daughter, Jennifer, has begun an online petition calling for more stringent bail conditions for young offenders after the boy breached the conditions of his electronic tag twice, was recalled to court, but was \"just returned home\" each time.\n\"The message being sent to the youth is that they can act with impunity, that it is excusable and acceptable to be the cause of a person's death,\" she said.\nIn his defence, the court heard the behaviour of the boy, who cannot be named because of his age, demonstrated immaturity, and he had special educational needs.\nDuring a police interview, the boy said: \"I had no intention of causing the guy's death or harm, I am very sorry he passed away.\"\n'Pushing and shoving'\nIn the early hours of 19 March last year Mr Netto, who was described by family members as \"a good soul,\" left the Duke of York pub on Uxbridge Road in Hanwell, crossing the street to approach the teenager and his friends.\n\"He shakes hands with one of them. He's just decided to talk with them,\" Metropolitan Police senior investigating officer Det Ch Insp Brian Howie told BBC News.\nThe teenage boy began to taunt Mr Netto, pulling down his trousers.\nCCTV footage shows Mr Netto falling to the ground twice, which police say was due to the \"pushing and shoving and the escalation of the incident\".\n\"This isn't just a shove, this is hooking someone's foot in and then violently shoving him from behind to ensure that Jerald face-plants into the ground,\" said Det Ch Insp Howie.\nMr Netto was unable to break his fall and his head hit the ground, causing a traumatic brain injury and triggering a heart attack.\nFootage then shows the teenager jumping over Mr Netto before fleeing the scene.\nA local couple called an ambulance but Mr Netto died in hospital later that day surrounded by his family.\nThe clarity of the CCTV images meant police were able to arrest the teenager within an hour of the assault.\nMr Netto was born in the Indian state of Kerala, moving to Southall in west London as a child along with his parents and two older brothers.\nHe qualified as an electrician, becoming well known in his community for practical skills from construction and car repairs to gardening - often delivered free to the elderly.\n'He made the room lighter'\nIn 1992 he married Ligin Netto, who said: \"He made everybody laugh. That's one thing everybody liked about him. He made the room lighter.\"\nMr Netto also cared for his elderly mother and was a devoted grandfather to four-year-old Messiah, who has autism and cerebral palsy.\nWhen police knocked on his wife's door \"the shock was immense\", she told BBC News.\n\"I was shaking. The lady police officer had to hold me tight.\n\"I still can't believe this has happened. It's like a nightmare. I used to pinch myself at night and I used to think: 'Is it real or am I having a dream?'\"\nTheir daughter Jennifer said: \"It's been really hard on my mum to then bear the responsibility of looking after my grandmother.\n\"She's found it very difficult because my dad used to help lift and carry her daily and now she doesn't have that support.\"\nThe attacker was originally charged with murder before he pleaded guilty to manslaughter in November last year.\nHe was remanded into the care of the local authority, which meant he was able to live at his home address under the care of his parents with a number of conditions attached.\nHe went on to breach the conditions of his electronic tag twice, and was recalled to court both times.\nOn both occasions the family attended court hoping the defendant would be sent to a young offenders' institution, but \"he just returned home\", the couple's daughter said.\nJennifer says the family's experiences have led her to conclude the justice system is \"completely one-sided\", favouring the defendant over the victim.\nShe also takes issue with attempts by the defence during the trial to downplay the incident as simply bad luck, asking: \"Would they have the same attitude if it was their father, their husband, or their son?\"\n\"We were made to feel that my father's death wasn't worthy of justice,\" she added.\n\"A life should nev",

    "Ronald Christie has 130 million trees growing on his nursery in Moray but fears many will have to be destroyed because of cuts to government funding.\nThe seedlings were being grown for new woodlands as part of the Scottish government's expanding forestry targets, which are critical for tackling climate change.\nBut with the budget now being slashed, Mr Christie predicts the market will dry up leaving skilled workers out of jobs.\nHe wants ministers to rethink cuts which he believes will damage the sector long-term.\nAs part of its climate change commitments, the Scottish government is meant to be increasing tree-planting to 18,000 hectares annually from this year, a target would involve about 28 million trees across an area about three times the size of Dundee.\nHowever, it was announced in the December budget that funding was being cut by 41%, from \u00c2\u00a377.2m to \u00c2\u00a345.4m.\nMinisters have admitted this is likely to mean only 9,000 hectares being planted in the year from April.\nMr Christie, the owner of Christies of Fochabers, which has operated for 200 years, described the cuts as an \"absolute shocker\".\nHe said: \"We've been encouraged to grow trees by the government to reach this target of 18,000 hectares.\n\"To grow trees takes a three-year cycle and unless we're told in the next few weeks if there is funding available, this whole lot will have to be destroyed.\"\nHe said that would amount to about 10 million tree seedings being ripped up and burnt with perhaps the same happening again next year if the funding allocation remains the same.\nThis includes Caledonian pine - which he said costs about \u00c2\u00a33,000 per kg for seed.\nMissed targets\nScotland has been leading the way in tree-planting and has been creating more new woodland than the rest of the UK combined.\nThis is largely driven by having a larger proportion of land which is not suited for arable farming.\nBecause trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow, woodlands are a key ingredient in tackling climate change.\nThe ultimate aim is to increase tree cover in Scotland from 19% of the land mass to 25%.\nBut in recent years, Scottish ministers have been consistently missing both their tree-planting and greenhouse gas emissions targets.\nThe forestry sector says the latest cuts will widen the gap between the targets and the results.\nIn 2021, 20,000 people in the UK were employed in the forestry sector and the figure has been growing year on year.\nBut now the industry feels like it has been left in limbo. Having planned for expansion it has found its ambitions being severely restrained.\nChristies employs dozens of people and has invested millions in equipment to expand its operation based on the Scottish government's targets.\nRhiannon Alexander is one of those who works on grading trees at the nursery.\nShe said: \"We need the funding because we can't do our jobs without the funding and with global warming we need to do all the stuff we can do.\n\"It's kind of worrying because (we ask) will we still have jobs?\"\nStuart Goodall, from Confor (Confederation of Forest Industries), said the need for trees to tackle climate change had \"galvanised\" the sector.\nHe said: \"Businesses had been investing millions of pounds, training people up and we were just starting to see that confidence seeping into the sector.\n\"Something like this is going to be a big blow and that confidence will take many years to get back.\"\nMr Goodall said tree-planting was the cheapest way to lock up carbon and the funding being cut is a relatively small amount compared with the overall budget.\nLast year the Scottish government increased its tree-planting target to 15,000 hectares but only about 8,200 was planted.\nMinisters blame the decision on cuts its block grant from the UK government but point out that Scotland is still planting more trees than the rest of the UK combined.\nNet-zero secretary Mairi McAllan said: \"I'm very clear that the contribution that tree planting makes to our climate targets, but equally to Scotland's economy, is absolutely vital.\"",
    "China has tightened its financial industry rules as the government tries to halt a deepening sell-off in the world's second largest economy.\nNearly $6tn (\u00c2\u00a34.7tn) has been wiped off Chinese and Hong Kong stocks since their most recent peak three years ago.\nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) says the measures will create \"a fairer market order\".\nUnder the new rules limits will be put on so-called \"short-selling\" from Monday.\nShort selling is when a trader bets that a share or other asset will fall in value. They borrow the asset and sell it immediately with the aim of buying it back later at a lower price and keeping the difference.\nDefenders of short selling say it can play an important part in financial markets, by helping find the true value of an asset.\nHowever, some critics see short selling as a ruthless trading strategy that undermines companies.\nThe latest announcement by the CSRC comes after a series of informal measures introduced by the regulator over the last year did little to shore up financial markets.\nThe CSRC said that following \"a complete suspension of the lending of restricted stocks\", which takes effect today, further limitations on securities lending will be introduced from 18 March.\nLast week, the country's premier Li Qiang asked authorities to take more \"forceful\" measures to stabilise share prices.\nThe sell-off in China's stock market comes as some investors are concerned that the country's economy could face a long period of slow economic growth.\nCentral to China's economic problems is its property market. For two decades, the sector boomed and accounted for a third of the country's entire wealth.\nBut when the government put limits on how much developers could borrow in 2020, they started owing billions which they could not pay back.\nWhen property giant Evergrande defaulted in 2021, after missing a crucial repayment deadline, it triggered the current crisis.\nOn Monday, the firm was ordered to liquidate by a court in Hong Kong, sending its shares down by more than 20% before trading in them was suspended.\nThe real estate sector's troubles have also revealed issues faced by the country's so-called \"shadow banks\" which have lent billions of dollar to developers.\nThe shadow banks operate in a very similar way to traditional banks but are not subject to the same regulations.\nIn November, Chinese officials launched an investigation into \"suspected illegal crimes\" at one of the country's biggest shadow banks, Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, which filed for bankruptcy and earlier this month.\nThere are also a number of indications that China's once-booming economy is slowing sharply.\nOfficial figures show the economy expanded by more than 5% in 2023. While that is stronger growth than many other major economies it is much lower than China saw before the pandemic.\nMeanwhile, the country's exports, which have been a major contributor to its growth, fell last year.\nAt the same time, youth unemployment hit a record high and local government debt has jumped.",

    "A police officer accused of having sex with a woman while on duty has told a court he felt \"glued to the floor\" as the encounter took place.\nJordan Masterson, 28, was responding to a 999 call from a woman in the early hours of 28 December 2021 when the alleged incident took place.\nGiving evidence on Friday he said the woman was \"upset\" when he arrived and seemed \"frightened\".\nThe former Cheshire Police constable denies misconduct in a public office.\nAt Chester Crown Court, Mr Masterson said the woman, referred to in court as female G, had called police several times to report a disturbance and been seen by other officers earlier that night.\nMr Masterson said the woman's \"demeanour\" changed when they went from her living room to her kitchen, where he had offered to make her a cup of tea.\nHe said he turned his bodyworn camera off because he thought she would talk to him about how much alcohol she had drunk.\nHe said: \"At the time I felt if I turned it off I'd be able to get information from her to help her.\"\nMr Masterson, who was based out of Widnes police station, said as he was making a cup of tea, he felt the woman touch his hand and he jolted away and told her to go and sit down.\nHe told the court the woman went into the living room, where he took her drink and sat on the sofa, about four feet away from her.\nHe said: \"I just sat on the edge and as soon as I looked over at her, I didn't even get to carry on the conversation, it was just straight away she put her leg over.\"\nHe said he pushed her off but she then climbed on top of him and kissed him, so he pushed her off again and went to the corner of the room to make a radio communication.\nMr Masterson said the woman left the room as he made the radio call but then returned \"completely naked\".\n'Completely numb'\n\"Straight away she started pulling me towards her, she started trying to kiss me, pulling my vest,\" he said.\nHe told the court he was \"completely shocked\", \"numb\" and \"hadn't processed what had just happened\".\nMr Masterson told the court \"there was no thought process\" and he could not feel anything as the woman moved towards him and had sex with him.\nHe said: \"I remember just being confused, feeling completely numb like I was glued to the floor.\n\"I couldn't feel my fingers. I've found it hard to explain ever since it happened.\"\nHe said he did not want to have sex with the woman and told the court he thought his erection was \"some sort of adrenaline reaction\" to the situation.\n\"I couldn't feel my hands, never mind feeling enjoyment out of something I didn't want to do,\" he told the court.\nHe said he left the house quickly after the sex and went to his car where he \"started crying\" and was \"getting overwhelmed with emotions\".\nHe denied later saying to the woman she should not tell anyone about what had happened.\nMr Masterson, of Clubmoor, Liverpool, cried in the witness box as he described wanting to be a police officer following a childhood during which his baby brother died and his mother turned to alcohol, resulting in him being cared for by relatives before she died when he was 12.\nHe resigned from the police force in June 2022 and has since worked as an assistant manager in Zizzi's restaurant and a delivery driver, the court heard.\nThe trial continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "More than 100 firefighters affected by the Grenfell fire have had their claims settled for \u00c2\u00a320m, a union says.\nThe fire, in the 23-storey North Kensington tower block on 14 June 2017, killed 72 people.\nThe Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it led the action by 114 members against companies involved in the fire, Kensington and Chelsea Council and London's fire commissioner.\nThey have been contacted by the BBC for comment.\nThe FBU said some of those who claimed were \"unable to work again due to severe trauma\", and others claimed for personal injury and loss caused by \"alleged negligence and breach of statutory duty\" on the night of the fire.\nTheir claims were finalised with Arconic Architectural Products, Celotex and Rydon Maintenance Limited, as well as the council and commissioner, after an agreement, including with the council, was reached last month .\nIt comes after some 900 civil claims from survivors and bereaved families were settled with a number of defendants in the High Court last year .\n'Unimaginable scenes'\nVincent Reynolds from Thompsons Solicitors, which represented the firefighters, said the fire had left an \"indelible mark on the firefighters who responded to the call\".\n\"Many bear the psychological scars of that night, struggling with trauma from the harrowing experience,\" he said.\n\"The incident exposed them to unimaginable scenes, and sparked a deeper reflection on fire and building safety policy.\n\"We hope this settlement brings closure of a sort for these firefighters, although we know that for many the injuries will last a lifetime.\"\nFBU general secretary Matt Wrack said:  \"The aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy is a stark reminder of the systemic failings of building safety and government accountability.\n\"Firefighters, many of whom have been deeply affected by the horrors they witnessed, continue to advocate for those living in unsafe conditions.\n\"We demand that the government takes urgent action to ensure such a disaster never recurs, and that there is meaningful accountability for a tragedy born out of disregard for human life.\"\nWelfare 'of paramount importance'\nKensington and Chelsea Council chief executive Maxine Holdsworth said in a report : \"The council has worked with other defendants to ensure that valid claims are resolved and compensated, in a way that mitigates the financial impact on the public purse.\"\nThe council declined to comment further.\nA spokesperson for Arconic said the company \"has been engaged in the Alternative Dispute Resolution process designed to resolve the legal claims brought by a group of firefighters following the tragedy at Grenfell Tower\".\n\"We confirm and welcome that the parties to that process have now signed a final agreement.

    "MPs have called for an end to single-word Ofsted judgments after school inspections.\nThe cross-party education select committee's report also said schools should not be automatically graded \"inadequate\" for minor safeguarding concerns.\nBut it said most in the sector still wanted \"strong accountability\" in schools.\nOfsted welcomed the report and said it would respond to its recommendations.\nChanging one or two-word judgments - like \"inadequate\" or \"requires improvement\" - can only be done by ministers.\nThe report said there was \"general agreement\" between school leaders, teachers, parents and others, on the need for an independent inspectorate for schools.\nBut it said relationships with Ofsted had become \"extremely strained\" and trust was \"worryingly low\".\nThe appointment of Sir Martyn Oliver , the new chief inspector, in January represented a \"crucial opportunity to reset and restore these relations\", the report said.\nThe committee's inquiry ended just weeks after the conclusion of the inquest into the death of Ruth Perry, who took her own life after an Ofsted inspection at her school in November 2022.\nShe had been head of Caversham Primary, in Reading, Berkshire, for 13 years.\nA coroner said the inspection, which was at times \"rude and intimidating\" and downgraded her school to the lowest rating, \"inadequate\", contributed to her death in January 2023. The school has since been regraded as \"good\".\nMrs Perry's death prompted calls from across the sector for changes to Ofsted . After December's inquest, coroner Heidi Connor warned of a risk of further deaths \"unless action is taken\".\nOfsted has since promised a full review of lessons to be learned and apologised fully for the first time for the role it played in Mrs Perry's suicide.\n\"We have started making changes to the way we work, but we know more must be done to address the pressures faced by school leaders and staff,\" an Ofsted spokesperson said.\nMrs Perry's sister, Prof Julia Waters, welcomed the committee's report and urged the government to respond to it.\nSpeaking to BBC 5 Live, she said one or two-word judgements were \"dangerous, misleading and simplistic.\"\n\"All I can say is that one word was catastrophic for my sister,\" she said.\nThe committee's report said \"one of the most strongly criticised\" aspects of the inspection process was the one or two-word judgments handed down to schools after an inspection.\nIt said Ofsted needed to work with the Department for Education to find an alternative.\nIntervention measures for schools rated \"inadequate\", including heads losing their jobs and schools being made to become academies, were adding \"further stress\" by creating a \"high-stakes\" inspection system, the report added.\nIt recommended that those measures should not be imposed until a reinspection of schools rated inadequate for \"uncomplicated\" issues that can be resolved quickly.\nNo school should be graded inadequate over safeguarding concerns unless it is \"fundamentally failing\" to keep children safe, it added.\nDeath of a Head\nHow Ruth Perry's death put Ofsted in the spotlight.\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)\nIn Sheffield, thousands of parents signed a petition last year after King Edward VII secondary school was told it had to become an academy, when Ofsted inspectors rated it inadequate because of safeguarding.\nHundreds of people joined a protest outside Sheffield City Hall in April 2023, calling for the academy plan to be reversed.\nMother Emma Wilkinson said: \"For us, that 'inadequate' wasn't simple, because it was inadequate in one area - in safeguarding - but good everywhere else.\n\"Personally I think the word 'inadequate' is not helpful. I think we should be talking about areas where schools can improve, because to me that describes a really failing school - and that clearly wasn't the case at King Edward's.\n\"It wasn't failing its children, but it's labelled with this awful word - inadequate - and all the staff and teachers and children and parents have got this label hanging over them.\"\nShe also called for parents to be listened to during the inspection process, and for inspectors to recognise the \"huge pressure\" schools are already under.\nTom Middlehurst, inspection specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders union, said he was \"pleased\" the committee had added to calls for an end to single-word judgments .\nHe said the work already done by the new chief inspector was cause for \"cautious optimism\", but added that the report \"underlines the scale of the challenge in front of him\".\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary at school leaders' union NAHT, said the committee's report meant there was an \"overwhelming consensus that single-word judgements have had their day\".\nBut Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said the report \"does not grasp the true scale of the problem\".\n\"Any model of change must begin by understanding the deep crisis that schools are enduring in respect of workload, staffing, attendance and me",
    "A former Jersey Mutual employee has been jailed after nearly \u00c2\u00a33.3m was stolen from the insurance firm.\nRoy Anthony Jeanne was  jailed for nine years after admitting a range of charges.\nHis co-defendant Michael John Timms was sentenced to four years in prison after admitting conspiracy to commit fraud.\nThe court heard how Jeanne, who was general manager, treated the firm as his \"own personal credit facility\".\nIt heard he formed a \"corrupt relationship\" with Timms to continue stealing money from the company.\nJeanne pleaded guilty to seven offences including larceny, falsification of accounts, removal of criminal property and conspiracy to commit fraud.\nTimms pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud.\nCrown Advocate Sam Brown told the court Jeanne had \"unfiltered access\" to the company's accounting system and his position meant he was unlikely to be questioned.\nThe court heard he stole money over 13 years to feed a gambling addition including by paying money into company accounts and making fictitious insurance claims.\nJeanne realised he was unable stealing on his own and so he formed a \"corrupt relationship\" with Timms, the court was told.\n'Breach of trust'\nIt heard Timms submitted 85 fake invoices to Jersey Mutual from his marketing company, allowing Jeanne to pass off money he was stealing as expenses.\nSentencing, Commissioner John Saunders said it was hard to imagine \"a greater breach of trust\".\nDet Insp Aiden Quenault, from States of Jersey Police, said the case reflected the \"complexity of financial crime investigation\".\n\"Those seeking to benefit from abusing their position in business and laundering their illicit gains will be identified, investigated and prosecuted,\" he said.\n\"Every effort will be made to confiscate and return any proceeds of crime to victims.\"\nA spokesman for Jersey Mutual said: \"The society and its members placed their trust in Mr Jeanne. He betrayed that trust, and Mr Timms conspired to help him do so.\n\"The society now awaits the decision of the court in relation to any Compensation Order granted, from which the society can recover as much of the stolen money from Mr Jeanne and Mr Timms as we can.\n\"It is important to note that these misdeeds never jeopardised the society's financial stability, nor led to any member suffering any losses of benefit. Nevertheless, we are taking this legal action in an attempt to recover funds that belong to the society.\n\"The society recognises, and deeply regrets, that Mr Jeanne was able to misuse his authority to defraud the society, in collaboration with Mr Timms. Since the fraud was uncovered, we have taken appropriate action to minimise any possibility that this could happen again.\n\"This has included the commissioning of independent third-party reviews of both the compliance and governance and accounting functions, whose recommendations we fully adopted and integrated into our policies and procedures.\"\nFollow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook .

    "The 7A bus runs four times a day, six days a week. Its 12.5 mile (20 km) route connects four settlements in South Cambridgeshire. But it only runs thanks to a tax payer subsidy of \u00c2\u00a3124 per passenger. Its operator admits it is not value for money and the elected mayor responsible for transport is planning big changes to the local network. What does the 7A tell us about how bus services need to change?\nJean Wakefield is three months shy of her 80th birthday. She is also - probably - the 7A's most regular passenger.\nMost Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays she catches it to shuttle between her home near the Imperial War Museum at Duxford airfield and a friend's house in the village of Sawston.\nShe is one of three passengers we meet on the 7A, as it completes two loops through countryside that straddles the M11.\n\"There were more people who used to use it, but several of them have died,\" Mrs Wakefield, who trained as a nurse, says.\nHow would she improve it?\n\"It doesn't always turn up. It needs to be reliable. I think more people would use it if it was more regular.\"\nShe agrees it gives her some independence and says without it she would have to walk, take a taxi or ask a friend for a lift.\nThe route, which is set by the local transport authority, used to include one of Cambridge's park and ride sites but has been trimmed over the years.\nBrian and Angela Swann, both 70, board the bus in Whittlesford, a village to the south of Cambridge.\nThe retired couple - who use public transport \"an awful lot\" - are on their way to the Imperial War Museum, after travelling from Bourne in Lincolnshire via another bus and a train in to Whittlesford Parkway station.\nMr Swann, who worked in logistics, said the \u00c2\u00a3124 subsidy was \"a lot of money\".\nIs it worth it?\n\"Having not been on this bus before and from what I've seen, it probably isn't,\" he says.\nA2B Travel Group has run the 7A since 2016.\nIn 2022-23, the service carried 771 passengers, despite around 23,000 people living nearby.\nBrian Clifford, A2B's owner and managing director, says he expects passenger numbers to be lower this year.\nMr Clifford says \"as much as you try and alter it and play with it\" the 7A \"just never seems to work\".\nHe adds: \"It doesn't run from a high population area to a high population area. It doesn't run particularly where shoppers or commuters want to go.\"\nBut it provides \"links to villages and settlements that have nothing else\".\n\"For the very few passengers that use it, it really is important,\" he continues.\nIs it worth \u00c2\u00a3124 per passenger?\n\"As a taxpayer myself, I would have to say 'no' on that one.\"\nSo, what needs to change?\n\"It needs to be more thought out, it needs to crucially have a better start and end point,\" he says. \"It needs to operate where people want to go and actually needs to operate probably a little more frequently.\"\nMr Clifford said the bus industry is still facing \"Covid fear\", which is putting some passengers off travelling, as well as a shortage of drivers.\nTo try to recruit and retain more staff, A2B has started training in-house.\nToday's driver, Charlie Morley, passed his test in December, a few days after turning 18.\nHe wanted to be a driver \"for as long as I can remember\" and recalls being \"mesmerised\" watching bus drivers when he was younger.\nHe says: \"For me I just like helping people. It's just an easy way you can be social, whilst being able to help people get where they're going and a lot of people appreciate it.\"\nLooking younger than many drivers has led to passengers questioning his credentials. He adds: \"I'm frequently getting asked where my dad is and stuff like that.\"\nThe above figures are for financial years, running from April to the end of March.\nAttracting drivers is one issue, attracting passengers is another. Figures up to March 2023 showed a 27% decline in journeys per head over a decade in Cambridgeshire; they are 16% down on the pre-pandemic level in 2019, but have shown signs of recovery.\nDirectly elected Labour mayor, Nik Johnson, who chairs Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority (CPCA) Board, is responsible for public transport in the area.\nLast year, CPCA reviewed 19 subsidised bus routes, including the 7A. While it had the highest per passenger subsidy, six others cost more than \u00c2\u00a340; all 19 were above CPCA's target of a \u00c2\u00a312 per passenger.\nThe review recommended the 7A is merged with a home-to-school service and could link up with other services to make savings.\nMr Johnson said CPCA had \"taken the bull by the horns\" by reviewing the 19 costly routes and that \"nobody could justify\" the 7A's level of subsidy.\nLater this week he is hoping the Board approves a budget that would see a mayoral \"bus tax\" increased from a yearly average of \u00c2\u00a312 per household to \u00c2\u00a336, raising around \u00c2\u00a311m.\nThe money would support around 30 new or expanded routes and on-call services, as well as cutting fares to \u00c2\u00a31 for under-25s.\nSubsidising routes, he says, is important to reduce social isolation \"otherwise who is ",
    "The UK and Canada are blaming each other after a dispute over beef and cheese led to the collapse of trade talks.\nNegotiations to thrash out a new agreement to replace the one the two countries had when the UK was still in the European Union had been running for nearly two years.\nBut on Thursday night, it emerged the UK had halted discussions , due to a lack of progress on the two food products.\nIt could mean tougher trading terms for the UK with a partner that accounted for 1.4% of its total trade in the 12 months to June 2023.\nGoods trade between the two countries was worth \u00c2\u00a319.2bn in 2020, according to the UK government, with UK imports from Canada worth \u00c2\u00a37.3bn and UK exports to Canada worth \u00c2\u00a311.8bn.\nThe implications of the talks collapsing could be felt by consumers and farmers in both countries. Another major sector, cars, will also be affected.\nHere's the likely impact on all three areas at a glance.\nBeef\nBritish farmers will see the collapse in talks as a big win. The body representing UK farmers, the National Farmers Union (NFU), has been putting pressure on the government to protect its members.\nBeef farmers in the UK are already facing competition from those in New Zealand and Australia, whose exports benefit from free trade deals with the UK, meaning tariffs are removed.\nMinette Batters, the president of the Nation Farmers' Union of England and Wales, said walking away from the Canadian trade deal would have been difficult, \"but it's the right decision\".\nCanada's government had been pushing for the UK to relax a ban on hormone-treated beef, which its producers say effectively shuts them out of the British market.\nThe Canadian Cattle Association said the UK had \"shown no indication that it is prepared to fully accept Canada's food safety system, which is widely recognised as one of the finest in the world\".\nIt's not the first time that beef has been a sticking point in trade relations between the two nations. Canada's farming industry has previously voiced its frustration to the government, saying that its meat is \"severely disadvantaged\" under a post-Brexit interim agreement with the UK, and essentially blocked out of that market.\nLast year, a coalition of Canadian farming groups protested the UK's accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement over concerns about that reciprocal access. They demanded that either the UK accept Canada's food safety system or pay compensation for their losses.\nCheese\nBritish cheese exports to Canada were worth \u00c2\u00a318.7m - or 2.4% of total cheese exports - in 2022, according to the Food and Drink Federation (FDF).\nThat translates to Canada importing a little more than two million kilograms of cheese from the UK (its fifth largest supplier), international trade data indicates.\nBritish firm Coombe Castle International is the largest UK cheese exporter to Canada and about a third of the cheese it exports goes to the country.\nBen Hutchins, its sales and marketing director, told the BBC the firm was \"pretty gutted\" that talks had been suspended, adding that the company had been exporting to Canada since 1980.\nHe said the suspension of talks \"doesn't look rosy\" for cheese exports.\nMr Hutchins said that with a third of the business tied up in Canada after 40 years, it won't be easy to quickly find new markets.\nIndustry group Dairy UK said the suspension of talks was \"regrettable, but there was little indication that Canada was really willing to improve access to the Canadian cheese market\".\nSince the beginning of the year, UK cheese exporters have seen a 245% tariff placed on British cheese going to Canada, impacting prices.\n\"This has put UK dairy exporters at a disadvantage and disrupted trade,\" a Dairy UK spokesperson said.\n\"However, exports to Canada are a relatively small part of UK production, and while some UK dairy companies will be faced with a significant commercial challenge, we understand that it will not be insurmountable,\" the group added.\nMeanwhile, Canadian cheese exports, including its cheddar, are mainly to other countries. The UK is not in its top ten markets.\nThe Canadian Cheese Council of Canada, which represents small and medium-sized cheese importers and their suppliers, said its members had spent decades building relationships with the UK cheesemakers.\nThe December expiry of the time-limited agreement that allowed the UK to continue to sell cheese without high tariffs has already caused \"significant\" disruption in the industry and \"will cripple cheese importers as well as small cheese shops across Canada\", it said.\nThat, combined with the pause in trade talks, put the efforts spent building those bilateral relationships \"in jeopardy\", Joe Dal Ferro, council chairperson, told the BBC.\n\"We feel abandoned by both governments\", he said.\nAfrim Pristine, who owns the Cheese Boutique in Toronto, told the BBC that cheese from the UK is popular - in December, he sold about 250 kg (550lb) of it every day",
    "Following weeks of bitter rows and mud-slinging between President William Ruto and Kenya's judges, two separate courts have ruled against the government, both on matters close to the president's heart.\nFirstly, a court on Friday ordered the government to stop taking payments for a new housing levy and just an hour or so later, a different court said the president could not send 1,000 police officers to Haiti, as Mr Ruto had promised the UN.\nAnalysts see this as a sign that Kenya's judges remain fiercely independent despite what they see as the president's attempts at intimidation.\nMr Ruto has recently launched a series of extraordinary attacks on the judiciary, accusing unnamed judges of corruption, while criticising those who went to court to stop government projects. He was responding to a previous series of rulings against his administration, one of which was last week overturned .\nBefore Friday's rulings, a lawyer who was in the team that designed the current constitution told the BBC that Kenyans would, in light of the continued criticism of the judiciary, \"be keen on seeing whether now, we are going to see decisions which are more favourable to the state\".\nBobby Mkangi said the rhetoric against the judges had been \"engineered towards achieving an outcome where the judiciary will fall to the weight of the executive\".\nBut this does not seem to have happened.\nLaw Society of Kenya president Eric Theuri told the BBC after the ruling on the housing levy that while the criticism was \"in a way intended to intimidate the court\", the outcome of the case was \"not surprising\" as the government had presented a \"very weak case\".\n\"We expected and were hopeful that the court would be able to look at the law and make the decision on the basis of the law and not anything else,\" he said.\nIn recent weeks, the president's attacks on the judges triggered a backlash from Kenyans, including politicians and civil society.\nMr Mkangi said the \"executive and presidency leading the onslaught\" had created \"pressure\" against judges, adding that it remained to be seen whether this would translate to favourable rulings.\nHe said \"the judiciary did indeed feel the pressure and felt commanded by the pressure\" to request an unprecedented meeting linked to matters live in court between the chief justice and the president.\nBut he also mentioned the \"philosophy of leadership\" of Chief Justice Martha Koome, who requested the meeting, adding that this was bound to arouse suspicion.\nThe meeting on Monday became a subject of intense national debate, amid a perception that the judiciary was giving in to the executive.\nChief Justice Koome herself had warned that the \"threats and declarations\" against the judiciary were \"extremely serious\".\nShe said they were an \"assault against the constitution, the rule of law and the very stability of the nation and can lead to chaos and anarchy in our motherland\".\nBut her request to meet the president and her subsequent attendance raised questions.\nMr Theuri, the LSK president, told the BBC the outcome of the meeting appeared as if the judiciary had gone to the executive with a \"begging bowl\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ultimately it goes towards undermining judiciary's independence and autonomy.\"\nEkuru Aukot, the leader of the opposition Third Way Alliance, told a local television station that the chief justice had allowed herself \"to go into dialogue with the person intimidating them\".\nThe BBC contacted the government spokesman's office and the presidency for comment on the accusations of undermining the judiciary.\nAfter the meeting, statements by both the chief justice and the presidency maintained that they were committed to upholding the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.\nThe chief justice said they had agreed that specific measures would be presented to speed up corruption cases.\nIt was also resolved that MPs and the government would support increased funding for the judiciary, including to hire more judges.\nDespite the meeting, the criticism of the judges continued.\nOn Thursday, the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association (KMJA) said it had \"noted with deep concern the continued atavistic attacks against the judiciary, individual judges and magistrates by the political class even after the tripartite meeting\".\nIt said the courts would now consider taking legal action against individuals attacking the judiciary, individual judges, and magistrates.\nEarlier this week, the Supreme Court took the extraordinary step of indefinitely barring prominent pro-government lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi from appearing before it, after accusing him of \"running a campaign aimed at scandalising, ridiculing and out-rightly denigrating this court\".\nMr Abdullahi said it was a \"badge of honour\" on X,  and later said that he would file a petition against the ban at the East African Court of Justice in neighbouring Tanzania rather than \"waste time in Koome's corrupt court\".\nThe rift between the judiciary and the political class is only ex",
    "The mother of a trainee paramedic who took her own life said her daughter was abandoned by her mental health team.\nRebecca McLellan, who had bipolar disorder, was 24 when she died at her flat in Ipswich in November.\nHer mother Natalie said her daughter was routinely left without care, despite constantly asking for help.\nThe Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT) said it was investigating her death and \"working with Rebecca's family\".\nMs McLellan, who grew up in Clacton, Essex, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2022.\nShe was originally cared for by a psychiatrist in Essex, but was discharged when they found out she was moving to Ipswich for work.\n\"Her GP then also threw her out because she was moving,\" her mother said. \"There was a real lack of support from the start of her diagnosis, despite Rebecca desperately trying to access it.\n\"She was hugely let down.\"\nMs McLellan, who worked for the East of England Ambulance Service throughout the pandemic, was then left with no doctor and no psychiatrist.\nShe managed to find a new GP in Ipswich, who referred her for specialist help.\nMs McLellan was given a care co-ordinator but he went on leave. She sent multiple emails asking who would be replacing him, but they went unanswered.\nAt times the support was so bad that she took it upon herself to increase her own medication when she was struggling, her mother said, because she could not get advice.\nShe also resorted to ordering her own drugs online and paying for them.\nDuring a mental health crisis in August, Ms McLellan took herself to a mental health unit in Ipswich, and refused to leave until they helped her.\n\"She told them she would drive anywhere in Norfolk and Suffolk to see someone, but they told her to leave - they threatened to call the police,\" her mother said.\n\"The lack of support defined her way of thinking about the future. Rebecca was worried she wasn't going to be well enough to work. She lived for her job.\"\nNatalie said an urgent referral was made to have her daughter's medication assessed but it was cancelled by the trust.\nThree weeks later, when she saw a psychiatrist, Ms McLellan was told she would have to change to the drug lithium, which she was \"terrified\" about, Natalie said.\n\"Rebecca was desperate not to go on that drug, she was worried it would change her whole personality, but she was told it was that or nothing.\"\nThree days later, she took her own life.\nHer mother hopes that by sharing her story it might help change the support available for others in the future.\n\"Rebecca always engaged with the doctors, she was desperate to get better, but she had to fight for help every step of the way and she could not see it improving,\" she said.\n\"She wanted to be a a paramedic from when she was three years old. All Rebecca wanted was to do the job that she loved.\"\nNearly 500 people attended her funeral and the ambulance service provided a guard of honour.\n\"Rebecca was beautiful, popular and clever,\" her mother said. \"She had a good job, a lovely flat and car, and family and friends who supported her.\n\"She was a medical professional and a force of nature who always engaged with professionals and followed the advice she was given.\n\"If she couldn't access help, what hope is there for other people?\"\nCampaigners have written to the chief constables of Norfolk and Suffolk to request a criminal investigation into thousands of mental health deaths in the area.\nA report found as many as 8,440 patients had died unexpectedly in Norfolk and Suffolk over three years.\nA spokesperson for NSFT said: \"Our thoughts remain with Rebecca's family following Rebecca's sad death.\n\"This incident is being investigated using the national Patient Safety Framework. Patient safety incident investigations are conducted to identify new opportunities for learning, improvement to healthcare systems and establish any underlying system factors that contributed to the incident.\n\"As part of this investigation, we are working with Rebecca's family to agree robust and inclusive terms of reference, to ensure they are supported through the process.\n\"Learning from this investigation will help inform improvements, improve safety and quality and reduce the opportunity for incidents like this to happen again.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Clean energy such as heat pumps need to be installed in Scotland's homes \"at a much faster rate\", according to the financial watchdog Audit Scotland.\nIts report said only about 5,000 heat pumps were installed in 2022, a long way short of the current target of about 25,000 a year.\nThe target is set to rise rapidly to 200,000 annually later in the decade.\nAudit Scotland said ministers needed to produce a \"clear delivery plan\" to ensure the targets were met.\nHomes are responsible for about 15% of Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from fossil fuel heating such as oil and gas boilers.\nReplacing them with zero emissions options is a vital component in Scotland's bid to be net zero by 2045 .\nThat is the point at which we are removing the same amount of greenhouse gases as we are emitting and no longer adding to the total amount in the atmosphere.\nAudit Scotland, the body responsible for making sure public money is well spent, has been examining the Scottish government's plans for decarbonising home heating, principally through air source heat pumps or district heating.\nHeat pumps operate like a fridge in reverse by converting cold external air into heat while district networks generate hot water which is pumped around multiple homes where the heat is extracted into radiators.\nThe report said it would require the majority of households to change their heating systems and described the scale of the challenge as \"huge\" with several \"risks to success\".\nNet Zero Secretary Mairi McAllan told BBC Scotland News that she welcomed the report and would respond fully at a later stage.\nBut she said: \"Ultimately tackling heat in buildings and decarbonising is one of the single most important interventions we need to make for emissions reduction.\n\"But equally the government is under no illusions about how much it goes to the heart of the way people live their lives and how it affects everyone across the country.\"\nMs McAllan said the plans needed to be ambitious as well as \"realistic and pragmatic\".\nThe Audit Scotland report said it had already taken two years for the Scottish government to build a team to deliver its strategy and that further delays to introducing legislation would risk missing important targets.\nIt recommends that ministers set out a \"clear plan of action\" to support the large scale change which is necessary.\nThe Scottish government has committed \u00c2\u00a31.8bn in the current parliamentary term to decarbonising home heating but estimates that a total of \u00c2\u00a333bn will be needed.\nThat figure is made up of public, business and individual household funding.\nFabrice Leveque, from environmental campaign group WWF Scotland, said the Audit Scotland report was a \"wake-up call\" and the transition away from fossil fuel heating needed to happen quickly.\nHe added: \"The sooner we begin this transition, the sooner we can see homeowners enjoy lower energy bills and warmer homes, and Scotland can play its role in tackling climate change by ending a key source of our emissions.\"",
    "The US has imposed sanctions on six officials in Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which it says are responsible for the cyber-attacks on American water plants late last year.\nThis comes as the US prepares its response to the drone attack that killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday.\nThe US has said an Iranian-backed militia group is responsible for that attack.\n\"The deliberate targeting of critical infrastructure by Iranian cyber actors is an unconscionable and dangerous act,\" said Brian Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, in the announcement.\nThe sanctioned individuals are part of the IRGC's Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), and include Hamid Reza Lashgarian, the head of the cyber organisation, and also a commander in the IRGC-Quds Force.\nThe Quds Force is Iran's shadowy overseas operations arm, which the US accuses of being responsible for attacks in the Middle East.\nMr Nelson added that \"the United States will not tolerate such actions and will use the full range of our tools and authorities to hold the perpetrators to account\".\nThe US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) calls America's water systems that residents rely on to drink clean water 'target-rich, cyber-poor'.\n\"It's why Cisa moves with such urgency,\" said the agency's executive assistant director for cyber-security, Eric Goldstein, in an interview with the BBC.\nHe said there could be \"a hypothetical scenario where [the cyber-attacks] had life-safety impact and affected the potability of water\".\nLate last year, a group named Cyber Av3ngers affiliated with the IRGC targeted the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa, in western Pennsylvania, along with several other water systems.\nThese facilities' use of technology manufactured by Unitronics, an Israeli company, made them unsuspecting targets.\nThe cyber group posted an image on compromised screens with their digital calling card, and the words \"down with Israel\".\n\"If you told me to list 10 things that would go wrong with our water authority, this would not be on the list,\" Matthew Mottes, the chairman of the authority, told the BBC's US partner CBS.\nAccording to Cisa, thanks to a simple default password - like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 - the Iranian hackers were able to disable a monitor regulating water pressure, but plant managers were able to take over manually.\nIt was considered a low-level hacking attempt, but federal officials are concerned that these attacks are not only ramping up but are also exposing how vulnerable America's water systems are.\n\"Many water utilities likely didn't know they were running a default password,\" said Mr Goldstein.\nFollowing the attacks, Pennsylvania Senators Bob Casey and John Fetterman, and Congressman Chris Deluzio sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland urging \"the Department of Justice to conduct a full investigation and hold those responsible accountable\".\nIn a statement to the BBC, Mr  Deluzio's office said: \"No-one expects to be in the crosshairs of a war in the Middle East, but in this day and age, cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare can occur anywhere - and everyone has to be prepared.\"\nCisa has warned there are several countries that are exploiting this lack of cyber-security awareness.\n\"Iranians cyber actors continue to mature and invest in their capabilities.

    "The allegations kept mounting in Canada: Election-meddling by China, an Indian-backed assassination on home soil, and a campaign to harass Iranian dissidents. Is Canada especially vulnerable to foreign interference?\nMichael Chong said it did not take long for him to become a target of Beijing.\nIn testimony before US lawmakers on Capitol Hill last year, the Canadian Conservative politician described how an alleged intimidation campaign against him was born after he spoke out against China's human rights record in parliament.\nHe said that a Chinese official in Canada began gathering details about his relatives living in Hong Kong shortly after, and that a smear campaign against him was launched on China's most-popular social media platform, WeChat.\n\"My experience is but one case of Beijing's interference in Canada,\" he said. \"Many, many other cases go unreported and unnoticed, and the victims suffer in silence.\"\nThe alleged targeting of Mr Chong, which first became public when intelligence reports were leaked to Canadian media, unleashed a fierce debate in the country around its vulnerability to foreign interference and the safety of its citizens.\nOn Monday, he and others will begin testifying before a public inquiry that will look into Beijing's meddling in Canada, especially its alleged efforts to sway the country's last two federal elections by backing certain candidates.\nChina has denied any interference and the allegations have soured relations between Beijing and Ottawa.\nWhile the inquiry will focus on claims of election interference by China, Russia, India \"and other foreign actors\", experts say the problem of foreign meddling in Canada is much more complex and widespread.\nSolving it, they say, demands a restructuring of the political and social DNA of the country, which has long-failed to prioritise matters of national security.\n\"Generally speaking, we have been neglecting national security, intelligence, law enforcement, defence, and so on,\" Thomas Juneau, a political analyst and professor at the University of Ottawa, told the BBC.\nWhile it is tough to determine whether Canada is uniquely vulnerable compared to its allies, Mr Juneau argued that other countries have done a far better job in addressing the issue.\nAn outdated system that is slow to adapt\nOne glaring problem, Mr Juneau said, is the out-of-date act governing the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (csis). It is almost 40 years old, designed with the Cold War in mind, \"when the fax machine was the new thing\", he said.\nBecause of this, he said, the nation's primary intelligence agency has been limited in its operations, focused on sharing information solely with the federal government.\nThis means possible targets are often left in the dark.\nThat was spotlighted by Mr Chong's story. He only discovered that he had been an alleged target of Beijing through the media, despite csis having monitored threats against him for at least two years.\nCanada has since launched public consultations into how the law governing csis can be amended to better inform and protect individuals who could be a target.\nThe source of Canada's security complacency, argued Richard Fadden, a former csis director and national security advisor to two prime ministers, is that Canada has lived in relative safety, largely protected from foreign threats by its geography: the US to the south, and surrounded by three oceans.\n\"I mean, nobody is going to invade Canada,\" he said.\nCanada's allies - like the US and Australia - have been quicker to adopt certain tools to help catch bad actors, such as establishing a registry of foreign agents and criminalising acts that can be classified as interference.\nIn December, Australia convicted a Vietnamese refugee who was found to be working for the Chinese Communist Party, thanks to a law it passed in 2018 that made industrial espionage for a foreign power a crime.\nSuch laws are not only important for charging and convicting culprits, but can also help educate the public and deter other nations from interfering, said Wesley Wark, a leading Canadian historian with expertise in national security.\nDiaspora groups are especially vulnerable\nMr Wark said the country's diverse population has also made it a convenient target for foreign states.\n\"We are a multicultural society and we have gone to great lengths over decades to preserve and protect that,\" he said.\nBut diaspora groups, especially those vocally opposed to the government of their country of origin, have naturally become a target.\nBritish Columbia lawyer Ram Joubin has had a first-hand look at the threats facing dissidents in Canada, particularly those from Iran.\nWhile investigating people with ties to the Iranian regime who call Canada home, Mr Joubin said he has heard from Iranian-Canadians who say they have been followed and harassed by regime agents in their own communities.\n\"We've had death threats, knock-on-the-door type of death threats,\" he said. \"And then we have a lot of peopl",

It could rule as early as next week.\nThe case is widely expected to end up before the US Supreme Court, where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority.\nExperts have said it could have a profound effect on the future of the American presidency and what is allowable by an individual who holds the office.\nThe four counts in the indictment were: conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy against the rights of citizens.\nMr Trump, 77, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has accused the Justice Department and the Biden administration of political persecution.\nHe also faces three other criminal trials. One is related to alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state of Georgia.\nAnother is related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office, and the third is related to an alleged hush-money payment Mr Trump made to porn star Stormy Daniels.\nWith the delay of the federal election subversion case, Mr Trump's first criminal trial will be over the alleged 2016 hush money payments, which is slated for 25 March in New York.",

    "A London taxi driver has told a court he had \"an uneasy feeling\" about Constance Marten and Mark Gordon while giving them a lift in the middle of the night.\nThe couple are on trial for the manslaughter by gross negligence of their newborn baby girl, Victoria.\nThey both deny the charges.\nIn a statement to the jury on Wednesday, Abdirisakh Mohamud said the encounter he had after picking the trio up in his taxi made him \"suspicious\".\nAnother witness told the Old Bailey she thought she saw the baby the following month in Brighton and later wondered if it was dead because it was so pale.\nThe parents travelled across England in taxis following the discovery of a placenta in their burnt-out car last year. They came to police attention following the car fire on the M61 near Manchester on 5 January 2023.\nOn Wednesday, jurors were told of things that police found near to the car, including a bible, a bag of more than 30 mobile phones, five used nappies and a cat in a cat box.\nOn 27 February, the pair were arrested in Brighton having been spotted without Victoria - whose body was found in a Lidl \"bag for life\" in a disused shed on 1 March.\nFor the first time since the trial started last Thursday, Ms Marten, 36, appeared in the dock beside Mr Gordon, 49.\nDriver Mr Mohamud explained how, after picking up the trio in Whitechapel during the early hours of Sunday 8 January 2023, \"the man asked me: 'Are you Muslim?', I said yes.\n\"He asked: 'Do you believe in the Koran?' I said yes.\"\nMr Mohamud told the court that the man then asked if he was trustworthy, and if there was a camera in the car.\n\"I said yes, despite the fact that there wasn't [a camera].\"\nHe explained that the man went on to ask if their conversation would be shared with anyone - to which Mr Mohamud replied \"no\", but noted it \"added to my fear that something was not right\".\nHe also asked the couple why they were wearing blue Covid facemasks, and the woman said she was a Muslim and it was her \"hijab\", the court heard.\nOn being told by the driver that it was not a hijab, she allegedly told him it was the only thing she had.\nMr Mohamud said he decided he was not happy to continue the journey and \"had an uneasy feeling with this couple\".\nAt the Old Bailey on Wednesday, Ms Marten - wearing a white blouse with pink flowers on it - could be seen exchanging a few words with Mr Gordon. The couple were sat with a dock officer between them.\nMr Mohamud told the court that instead of taking the couple and their baby to Tesco in Enfield, he dropped them off early on Green Lanes in Haringey, north London.\nJurors heard how he was so worried he stopped and spoke to some police officers about the pair.\n\"The more I thought about it the more I felt concerned about the baby,\" he continued.\nHaving been dropped off in Haringey, the prosecution say the couple then ordered a minicab to Portsmouth.\nThe prosecution allege the couple were trying to avoid the authorities because their previous four children had all been taken into care.\nThey say the couple fled, travelling in taxis from Liverpool to Harwich, then onto Colchester and London.\nIn a statement read to the jury, the driver of the new taxi, Hasan Guzel, described picking the couple up near an alleyway in Haringey. First Ms Marten got in, then Mr Gordon appeared with their bags.\nMr Guzel told them the price was \u00c2\u00a3475.

Jurors rejected her rape claim.\nMr Trump has vowed to appeal, calling the outcome of the case \"absolutely ridiculous\".\nMs Carroll, 80, told ABC News on Monday: \"I'd like to give the money to something Donald Trump hates.\n\"If it will cause him pain for me to give money to certain things, that's my intent.\"\nThe former magazine columnist suggested the money could be used to set up a \"fund for the women who have been sexually assaulted by Donald Trump\".\nDozens of women have accused the former president of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment dating back to the 1970s. He denies wrongdoing.\nMs Carroll accused Mr Trump of forcing himself on her in a dressing room of the luxury Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan in the 1990s.\nThe writer - who conducted Monday's interview seated beside her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan - said she had found it difficult to eat or sleep in the weeks leading up to the trial.\nBut she said her anxiety evaporated when she saw him in court.\n\"I looked out,\" she said. \"There he was and it was like he was like nothing - like an emperor without clothes.\"\nMs Carroll told ABC some of the jurors smiled at her as they left court after their decision to award $18.3m for compensatory damages and $65m in punitive damages was announced.\n\"It made me burst into tears because they met my eyes for the first time,\" she said.\nPending an appeal, Mr Trump, 77, must take steps to pay Ms Carroll, according to her lawyer.\nMs Kaplan said Mr Trump would either have to secure a bond, allowing him to avoid having to pay the full $83.3m right away.\nBut it would also require a bank to loan him a significant sum, carrying interest.\nMr Trump could also simply deposit $83.3m with the court.\nWhen he was ordered to pay $5.5m for separate defamatory comments about Ms Carroll last year, he deposited the whole sum.\nIf he does neither of these things, Ms Carroll can \"start collecting right away\", Ms Kaplan said, adding she was \"confident\" he would pay eventually.",

    "India has dismissed allegations by Pakistan that its agents killed two Pakistani citizens on its soil in 2023, calling them \"false\".\nPakistan's claims come months after Ottawa alleged that India was involved in the murder of a Sikh separatist in Canada - India has denied this.\nOn Thursday, Islamabad said it had \"credible evidence\" of links between the two killings and Indian agents.\nIndia's foreign ministry called it \"malicious anti-India propaganda\".\nThe two deaths in Pakistan include the killing of Muhammad Riaz in Rawalakot city in September 2023 and Shahid Latif in Sialkot city in October 2023, the country's foreign ministry said in a press briefing on Thursday. One of the men was shot dead while praying at a mosque, while the other was killed outside one.\nPakistan's foreign ministry did not disclose who these people were or the reasons for Delhi allegedly dispatching agents to carry out the killings within its arch-rival's territory.\nForeign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Qazi called the killings \"unacceptable\" and \"a violation of its sovereignty\".\n\"We have documentary, financial and forensic evidence of the involvement of the two Indian agents who masterminded these assassinations,\" he said.\nIndia must be held \"accountable\" for its \"blatant violation of international law\", he added.\nIndia did not directly address the specific allegations raised by Pakistan but called the country an \"epicentre of terrorism, organised crime and illegal transnational activities\".\n\"India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would consume by its own culture of terror and violence,\" its foreign ministry said in a statement.\nMr Qazi also said that the killings in Pakistan were similar to attempts in Canada and the US - though those allegations were about the murders or attempted murders of Sikhs, not Muslims.\nIn November 2023, the US said it had foiled an alleged plot by an Indian man to assassinate an American citizen in New York who advocated for Khalistan, or a separate Sikh state.\nNikhil Gupta was allegedly directed by an Indian government official who was not named or charged in the indictment.\nThe White House said it had raised the alleged assassination plot with India at the most senior levels. India said it had formed a high-level inquiry committee to \"address the security concerns highlighted by the US government\".\nThe news came months after Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was \"credible\" evidence connecting the Indian government to the murder of a Sikh leader in British Columbia in June. India denied any role in that killing.\nThe allegation led to a steep deterioration in ties between the two countries.\nThe Khalistan movement peaked in India in the 1980s with a violent insurgency centred in Sikh-majority Punjab state.\nIt was quelled by force and has little resonance in India now, but is still popular among some in the Sikh diaspora in countries such as Canada, Australia and the UK.\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

    "The culture secretary has announced that the government will start a fresh inquiry into the UAE-backed bid for the Telegraph.\nIt comes after the bidder RedBird IMI changed the structure of its bid at short notice, saying the ownership of the new holding company would now reside in the UK.\nThe government originally opened investigation of the bid in December.\nIt has cited concerns over the \"need for accurate presentation of news\".\nThe inquiry will also look into the deal's impact on the \"free expression of opinion in newspapers\", culture secretary Lucy Frazer said.\nRedBird IMI's changes were disclosed just days before the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and communications regulator Ofcom were due to submit their review of the original deal to take over the Telegraph and its sister title, the Spectator.\nIn a statement earlier this week, warning that she was considering issuing a new PIIN (Public Interest Intervention Notice), Ms Frazer said that the last minute changes were not \"conducive to the full and proper functioning of the process\".\nMs Frazer said the CMA and Ofcom have to make their new report by 11 March.\nRedBird IMI is backed by Emirati royal and Manchester City football club owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who said the tweak to the corporate structure was to clarify that it would have no management or editorial involvement \"whatsoever in the title\".\nUnder the new plan, the publications will now be owned by a new registered company in England, of which RedBird IMI, led by former CNN executive Jeff Zucker, is a limited partner. In an interview with the BBC in January , Mr Zucker said journalists will be given total editorial freedom.\nBut there have been concerns from MPs, many of the Telegraph's current and former journalists, and its readership that the newspaper might fall under the control of an authoritarian foreign state.\nThe culture and media secretary also cited concerns around public interest when she intervened in December to scrutinise the sale.\nThe Telegraph and the Spectator magazine were put up for sale last year when they were seized by Lloyds Banking Group from long-time owners the Barclay family, which had failed to pay back a loan of more than \u00c2\u00a31bn.",
    "The Spanish congress has blocked a controversial amnesty law that aimed to benefit Catalan nationalists involved in separatist activities, in a shock move.\nThe Together for Catalonia (JxCat) party voted against it over fears it does not provide enough protection for those politicians who are being investigated for terror-related crimes.\nThey included the ex-president of the Catalonia region, who was involved in a failed bid for independence in 2017.\nThe legislation has divided Spain.\nThe bill, presented by Socialist Pedro S\u00c3\u00a1nchez's government, faced its first major parliamentary test on Tuesday.\nWith an array of nationalist parties, including JxCat - led by former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont - in favour of an amnesty, the law appeared set to be approved by congress.\nHowever, instead it was blocked as JxCat voted against it, citing what it said was judicial interference aimed at sabotaging the law.\n\"We cannot participate in allowing the Catalan independence movement to be exposed to the whims of the politicised Spanish judiciary,\" said Miriam Nogueras, spokeswoman for JxCat.\nThe conservative People's Party (PP) and the far-right Vox, which have both been fierce critics of the amnesty, also voted against it, meaning the bill received 171 votes - five short of the majority it needed.\nIt will now be returned to a parliamentary commission which must resubmit the bill within a month, after revision. The law would also need to be approved by the senate before being implemented.\nLast week, a national court judge, Manuel Garc\u00c3\u00ada-Castell\u00c3\u00b3n, issued a report suggesting Mr Puigdemont and some others could be accused of terrorist offences because of alleged involvement with Democratic Tsunami, a pro-independence activist group which staged mass protests in 2019, including one which brought Barcelona's El Prat airport to a halt.\nThe terrorism claim meant that the former Catalan president risked being excluded from the amnesty.\nMr S\u00c3\u00a1nchez's Socialists immediately negotiated with JxCat and their fellow nationalists of the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) amendments to the bill aimed at ensuring Mr Puigdemont remained within the amnesty's ambit.\nThe modification stated that those involved in terrorist crimes that did not knowingly violate human rights were still eligible to benefit from the amnesty.\nNonetheless, a second report issued by Mr Garc\u00c3\u00ada-Castell\u00c3\u00b3n specified that Democratic Tsunami may indeed have breached human rights.\nIn a separate development another judge, Joaqu\u00c3\u00adn Aguirre, raised the possibility of Mr Puigdemont being investigated for high treason for alleged contacts with Russian officials ahead of the 2017 secession attempt. That crime would also exclude him from the amnesty.\nDespite JxCat demands that further amendments be added to the legislation to adapt to these developments, the Socialists insisted on leaving it untouched.\nERC reprimanded JxCat for voting against the law.\n\"This law has enough strength to not be changed by the prevaricating judges who want it to hit the rocks,\" said Pilar Vallugera, of ERC.\nThe right-wing opposition has claimed the amnesty is unconstitutional and that Mr S\u00c3\u00a1nchez is trying to push it through because he needs the parliamentary backing of ERC and JxCat.\n\"S\u00c3\u00a1nchez has decided to be a hostage [to Catalan nationalism], but we Spaniards are not going to pay the ransom,\" said PP leader Alberto N\u00c3\u00ba\u00c3\u00b1ez Feij\u00c3\u00b3o.",
    "A man who has admitted to damaging a controversial Satanic Temple holiday display in the Iowa Capitol is now facing a serious hate crime charge.\nMichael Cassidy, 35, an ex-Navy pilot who lost a race for the Mississippi legislature last year, was motivated by the victim's religion, prosecutors say.\nOn Tuesday, he was charged with third-degree criminal mischief in violation of individual rights - a hate crime.\nMr Cassidy has already raised $110,000 (\u00c2\u00a386,000) for his legal defence.\nIn a statement, the Polk County prosecutor's office said that Mr Cassidy \"dismantled\" the \"Baphomet Altar\" on 14 December and \"destroyed the headpiece\".\n\"In addition, evidence shows the defendant made statements to law enforcement and the public indicating he destroyed the property because of the victim's religion,\" prosecutors added.\nPhotos posted online show the display featured a depiction of a goat's head known as a Baphomet statue and a wreath adorned with a pentagram.\nIt had been allowed in Iowa's statehouse under rules that permit religious installations for two weeks during the holidays.\nIts presence divided Republicans leaders in the state and it was criticised by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in December during his presidential run.\nMr Cassidy had previously told conservative website The Sentinel that he destroyed the shrine in order to \"awaken Christians to the anti-Christian acts promoted by our government\".\n\"I saw this blasphemous statue and was outraged,\" Mr Cassidy said. \"My conscience is held captive to the word of God, not to bureaucratic decree.

    "Actress Sarah Snook has said she has become more aware that \"beauty has an expiry date\" while working on her new play, the Picture of Dorian Gray.\nThe Succession star is starring in a one-woman adaptation of Oscar Wilde's novel in London's West End.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that relying too much on one's beauty is a \"slippery slope\".\n\"What I'm learning with Dorian Gray is defining oneself in that realm, it has an expiry date of some sort,\" she said.\nDealing with themes of morality, narcissism and excess, The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul in exchange for eternal youth and beauty.\nThe show's titular protagonist makes a deal that his body will retain perfect youth, while a recently-painted portrait of him - representing his soul - grows older and uglier instead.\nSnook said the themes of the play also touch on how someone's beauty can impact those around them, and how power can be abused.\n\"It expands beyond just youth and beauty, what does one do with unlimited power gained through youth and beauty?\" Snook said.\n\"And if there's no checks and balances on an individual, and everyone around this one person wants to possess and control and have a taste of that youth and beauty, what does the person who owns that youth and beauty get to do to them?\"\nThe new stage adaptation of Wilde's 1890 novel has already enjoyed a successful run in Snook's native Australia, although a different actress played the leading role there.\nThe West End adaptation opens in London in early February and will run for nearly 12 weeks.\nSnook recently hit the headlines when she revealed a film producer once told her not to eat a piece of chocolate cake early in her career.\nRecalling the encounter, Snook said: \"I'll eat whatever I want to, it's my own body, my own choices.\"\nThe actress said she was \"too young and naive\" to argue back at the time.\n\"And that's the unfortunate situation,\" she continued, \"when there's a person in a position of authority and taking advantage, mindlessly saying something, it can be taken the wrong way and taken on in a certain context that holds with that person for the rest of their life potentially.\"\nEarlier this month, Snook won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her performance in Succession, which concluded after its fourth season last year.",

    "Tech billionaire Elon Musk has claimed his Neuralink company has successfully implanted one of its wireless brain chips in a human.\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said \"promising\" brain activity had been detected after the procedure and the patient was \"recovering well\".\nThe company's goal is to connect human brains to computers to help tackle complex neurological conditions.\nA number of rival firms have already implanted similar devices.\n\"For any company producing medical devices, the first test in humans is a significant milestone,\" said Professor Anne Vanhoestenberghe of King's College London.\n\"For the brain computer interface community, we must place this news in the context that whilst there are many companies working on exciting products, there are only a few other companies who have implanted their devices in humans, so Neuralink has joined a rather small group.\"\nHowever, she also suggested there needed to be a note of caution as \"true success\" could only be evaluated in the long-term.\n\"We know Elon Musk is very adept at generating publicity for his company,\" she added.\nAmong the other companies to make similar advances in the field is the \u00c3\u0089cole Polytechnique F\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rale in Lausanne (EPFL), in Switzerland, which has successfully enabled a paralysed man to walk just by thinking .\nThat was achieved by putting electronic implants on his brain and spine which wirelessly communicate thoughts to his legs and feet.\nDetails of the breakthrough were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature in May 2023.\nThere has been no independent verification of Mr Musk's claims, nor has Neuralink provided any information about the procedure he says has taken place.\nBBC News has approached both Neuralink and the US's medical regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for comment.\nNeuralink testing\nNeuralink has been criticised in the past, with Reuters reporting in December 2022 that the company engaged in testing which resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,500 animals, including sheep, monkeys and pigs.\nIn July 2023, the head of the US Department of Agriculture - which investigates animal welfare concerns - said it had not found any violations of animal research rules at the firm.\nHowever, a separate investigation by the agency is ongoing.\nMr Musk's company was given permission to test the chip on humans by the FDA in May 2023.\nThat gave the green light for the start of the six-year study during which a robot is being used to surgically place 64 flexible threads, thinner than a human hair, on to a part of the brain that controls \"movement intention\", according to Neuralink.\nThe company says that these threads allow its experimental implant - powered by a battery that can be charged wirelessly - to record and transmit brain signals wirelessly to an app that decodes how the person intends to move.\n\"[It] has great potential to help people with neurological disorders in future and is an excellent example of how fundamental neuroscience research is being harnessed for medical advances,\" said Professor Tara Spires-Jones, president of the British Neuroscience Association.\n\"However, most of these interfaces require invasive neurosurgery and are still in experimental stages thus it will likely be many years before they are commonly available.\"\nTelepathy\nIn another post on X, Mr Musk said Neuralink's first product would be called Telepathy.\nTelepathy, he said, would enable \"control of your phone or computer, and through them almost any device, just by thinking\".\n\"Initial users will be those who have lost the use of their limbs,\" he continued.\nReferring to the late British scientist who had motor neurone disease , he added: \"Imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer. That is the goal.\"\nWhile Mr Musk's involvement raises the profile of Neuralink, some of his rivals have a track record dating back two decades. Utah-based Blackrock Neurotech implanted its first of many brain-computer interfaces in 2004.\nPrecision Neuroscience, formed by a Neuralink co-founder, also aims to help people with paralysis. And its implant resembles a very thin piece of tape that sits on the surface of the brain and can be implanted via a \"cranial micro-slit\", which it says is a much simpler procedure.\nExisting devices have also generated results. In two separate recent US scientific studies, implants were used to monitor brain activity when a person tried to speak, which could then be decoded to help them communicate.",

We can't sell it, we can't mortgage it.\"\nMr Uysal said: \"I feel that both RMG and the fire service have not put any priority on this and are not considering the impact on people.\"\nHe added: \"We just want to know what is being done and when they are going to open the building.\n\"For more than three years we've been paying RMG and we've never been given an opening date.\"\nLee Ashworth, 74, from Royton in Oldham, owns two apartments in the building and said he had been paying \u00c2\u00a3500 in management fees and \u00c2\u00a3150 ground rent per month for each apartment since the building was closed.\n\"We don't seem to be progressing at all. Why isn't it open? One side seems to blame the other. It's just bouncing backwards and forwards.\n\"These flats are our pension and livelihood. It leaves us tight for money. We can't sell because no-one will buy a locked up flat.\"\nAn RMG statement said: \"Proposals for the alarm have been submitted to the fire service who has requested further amendments, which the fire engineers are working on as a priority.\n\"We hope to have positive progress for the residents soon.\n\"Unfortunately, we do not have a specific date for when the building will be reopened but all efforts are being made to ensure this progresses as quickly as possible.\"\nGMFRS said it had taken a \"significant length of time\" for a detailed proposal to be provided to the fire service and it would be reviewing that before writing to interested parties with \"next steps\".\nIt added: \"The prohibition of any building is a significant step and is only taken as a matter of last resort when there is no other option to protect the public.\n\"The safe reoccupation of the Victory Apartments is the priority for GMFRS and there has been extensive advice and engagement with representatives of the building's owner on the steps necessary to allow the Prohibition Notice to be lifted.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Pakistan is in unprecedented times. Anger, disappointment, and hope are all intertwined.\nThis Muslim-majority country of 241 million is about to vote in a civilian parliament for the third time in a row. It is a first for a state where no prime minister has ever finished their term and, with a long history of military rule and dictatorship, it should be a moment to celebrate.\nBut the 8 February vote is still taking place in the shadows of alleged military interference.\nNo election in the country's history has been without its controversies, but this one seems to be racking up more than most - not least the fact one former prime minister sits behind bars, unable to stand, while another re-emerges from self-imposed exile, his criminal convictions swept away.\nHere is what you need to know about the poll in Pakistan.\nWhy is this election important?\nPakistan is an arch-rival to India, shares volatile borders with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, has a love-hate relationship with the USA and is a close friend of China - whoever comes to power in this nuclear-armed state matters.\nFor the last few years, the country's politicians have been busy wrangling over who gets that power. They ousted Imran Khan, the last elected prime minister, in 2022 and replaced his administration with a coalition government.\nThat coalition was replaced by an unelected caretaker government last August, which should have held elections by November. After delays officials said were caused by the census, the vote is now going ahead.\nWhat many think is needed now is stable government - not only to deal with things like the recent tit-for-tat missile strikes with Iran, which many feared might boil over into something worse, but also to continue to secure the financial aid and investment the government is so reliant on.\nHowever, a quick look at the front runners suggests anything but stability.\nThis three-time prime minister did not stand in the 2018 election, for the simple fact he was in prison and was banned from running for office after a corruption scandal involving multimillion pound London apartments.\nSix years later - following a period in exile in a luxury London flat - Sharif is back.\nHis PML-N party, under his brother's leadership, took control after Khan's ousting in 2022.\nMeanwhile, in the last two months - just in time for the 2024 election - he has been cleared of all charges, the lifetime ban deemed unconstitutional.\nMany speculate that the support he garnered from the military establishment and the judiciary, after a fallout with Khan, has paved the way for his potential fourth term as prime minister.\nBut Sharif knows well that the army can turn. His strained relations with them during his third stint in office, which began in 2013, were followed by his ousting. His second term was cut short by a military coup in 1999.\nCricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, 71, will not be on this year's ballot, because this time he's the one behind bars during an election, serving a sentence he and his supporters decry as \"politically motivated\" and \"a conspiracy\".\nHis rise to power - and fall from grace - have both been attributed to the army, despite denials by both parties. His opponents in 2018 accused him of being their proxy, while his supporters allege the army chief is behind his jailing.\nBack in 2018, the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was portrayed as a change candidate, promising to end dynastic politics, ensure accountability of corrupt politicians, reform the judiciary and create jobs for young people as part of a revamped economy.\nBut under his rule, the economy collapsed, the cost of living soared, many of his political opponents were jailed, media freedoms were curbed and human rights violations and attacks against journalists increased.\nKhan was also widely criticised for giving a nod to signing a peace deal with the Pakistani Taliban that backfired, and for supporting Taliban rule in Afghanistan - not to mention controversial remarks justifying the violence against women in Pakistan and denial of education to girls in Afghanistan.\nSome political analysts argue his support has dipped so much in recent years that he would have been defeated if an election had been held (as he called for) in 2023 - prison or no prison.\nAnd yet, a Gallup poll - released in January 2024 - found he was still the most popular politician nationally, though Mr Sharif had closed the gap considerably in the last six months.\nThere are real concerns the PTI is not being given a fair chance to campaign. Many of its leaders are behind bars or have defected, its candidates are having to stand as independents and others are on the run. The party was also stripped of its cricket bat symbol, essential to help millions of illiterate voters choose where to mark their ballots.\nMeanwhile, with just a week to go until the vote, Pakistan's courts handed down two more sentences to Khan, who was already serving three years.\nAt just 35, Bhu",
    "A cladding fire at a block of flats in north-west London has led to the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) warning of \"criminal complacency\" on the part of the government and some building firms.\nInitial reports from London Fire Brigade confirm cladding was involved in the Wembley fire. No-one was hurt.\nBarry Gardiner MP said he had previously raised concerns with Petworth Court's housing association.\nOctavia Housing said: \"The safety of our residents is our priority.\"\nThe blaze in Elm Road broke out late on Monday afternoon and was brought under control by 22:00 GMT.\nMr Gardiner, who represents Barnet North, said Octavia had been advised three years ago that the cladding was unsafe and \"had not done anything\" to remove it.\nThe MP also said that Octavia did not have a plan to start fire remediation work and had \"not done anything significant to remove the cladding or advise residents when work would commence or who would pay for it\".\n\"My concern is for the residents who have lost so much,\" Mr Gardiner said. \"We must investigate what has happened and if it could have been avoided.\"\nHe also drew comparisons with the Grenfell Tower fire in west London in which 72 people died - flammable cladding has been cited as a major cause of its spread.\nGrenfell fire relatives group, Grenfell United, warned on social media that the fire could have had \"a very different outcome\".\nIn a letter sent to residents in October, Octavia said its work on removing the cladding could not progress because \"no realistic agreement\" could be made with the primary contractor for the remediation works, Vistry Group.\nA spokesperson for the Vistry Group, a housebuilding firm, said they could not comment on the specific details.\n\"However, we have been working with the building owner and will continue to do so to help ensure works are completed on site as necessary,\" the spokesperson added.\n\"We are continuing to engage with all parties as a matter of urgency to put in place the appropriate arrangements.\"\nThe FBU said it warned of the dangers of flammable cladding years before the Grenfell Tower fire.\n'Decades of deregulation'\nGeneral Secretary Matt Wrack said: \"Decades of deregulation have created unnecessary risks to residents and firefighters, and put homes and lives at risk.\n\"Government ministers and building companies have been criminally complacent.\n\"We will continue to demand justice for the victims of this situation, and urgent action to ensure that buildings are safe.\"\nA spokesperson for Octavia Housing said: \"Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the fire at Petworth Court and we're glad to hear no injuries have been reported.\n\"We will support the fire service as they investigate the cause of the fire and continue to support residents who have been affected.\"\nThey added Octavia Housing was working with Brent Council's Emergency Response team and other agencies to support the residents.\nAt least 125 firefighters and 20 fire engines were called to the Wembley blaze, where half the external side of the building, and all of the roof, was damaged.\nLondon Fire Brigade said residents left the building, all were accounted for and there were no injuries.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "A football club in the National League South has received mixed responses after it announced a new club crest.\nYeovil Town announced on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the new badge will be used from the 2024/25 season.\nThe club said the new identity 'pays homage to our rich footballing tradition' and 'honours the glove-making heritage' of the town.\nIn a statement Yeovil Town said: \"The gloves and the ball serve as a powerful symbol of our identity.\n\"When designing our new badge, we sought to capture the essence of both our footballing tradition and our town's proud history.\n\"The gloves and the ball serve as a powerful symbol of our identity, uniting past and present in a dynamic emblem that resonates with supporters young and old.\"\nYeovil Town, are nicknamed the Glovers, which is a reference to the history of glove-making in the town during the 18th and 19th centuries.\nThe new badge has divided fans on social media with a lot of comments expressing negative opinions about the newly designed logo.\nOne fan commented: \"Awful design and looks like it's been generated on an Etch-a-Sketch from the 1980's.

    "Ministers have issued a fresh warning to a mayoral authority over how it is being run.\nThey have sent a second letter, called a best value notice, to Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority .\nIt said it recognised the authority's progress and that making changes was \"likely to take time and will require sustained effort\".\nRob Bridge, the authority's chief executive, acknowledged it had more work to do.\nMinisters said they were concerned about the \"culture\" and \"effective partnership working\" at the authority, which is responsible for public transport, adult skills, and economic growth and was established in March 2017 after a devolution deal.\nThe authority first received a 12-month best value notice in January 2023, after auditors found \"significant weaknesses\" in its governance arrangements.\nThe second is expected to be in place for six months.\nLabour Mayor Nik Johnson, who chairs the authority's board, was also asked to apologise and undertake training after an investigation found he had breached its code of conduct.\nA letter from Max Soule, deputy director for local government stewardship at the Department for Levelling Up , said the government recognised the steps taken to \"address the serious issues at the authority\".\nThese included making progress against an improvement plan, including permanent appointments to its senior leadership team.\nBut Mr Soule added that \"embedding cultural change across the organisation and ensuring that it is having the desired, long-term impacts is likely to take time and will require sustained effort from both officers and, indeed, [elected] members\".\nHe continued: \"Further, the Department remains concerned that, despite efforts made, more work is needed to ensure effective partnership working between all levels of the Combined Authority and its constituent authorities, to enable the area to achieve its full potential.\"\nThe authority's board is made up of the mayor, local council leaders and a business representative.\nMr Soule's letter also said work done by authority staff \"needs to be matched by the actions of the [Combined Authority] Board itself\".\nMr Bridge, the authority's chief executive, said the notice acknowledged the progress that had been made, including changes to procurement and making permanent appointments to the senior leadership team.\n\"There is, of course, still more work for us to do and I look forward to working in partnership with our constituent councils and the Independent Improvement Board to continue to deliver for the businesses and communities of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough,\" he said.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook and Instagram .

    "After months of delay, caused by a potential rare water voles' burrow and an exploding World War Two bomb, Great Yarmouth's third river crossing will officially open to road and marine traffic later.\nWhat will the new bridge mean for the seaside resort?\nWhy was the third river crossing built?\nThe \u00c2\u00a3121m Herring Bridge crosses the River Yare in Great Yarmouth and is the town's third river crossing.\nIt is hoped it will relieve pressure on the resort's existing Haven and Breydon bridges, especially during the peak tourist season.\nGreat Yarmouth is seen as a gateway to the Norfolk Broads and the North Sea, which serves Britain's oil, gas and renewables sectors.\nIt links the port area with the A47 - the main road carrying traffic to the Midlands and onwards to the north of England.\nThe bridge was first put forward by Norfolk County Council in 2016 to help ease traffic congestion, shorten journey times and improve journey reliability.\nThe authority said the bridge would help support investment, regeneration and economic growth opportunities.\nConstruction started in January 2020, with the whole process, from design, planning and consent, taking about seven years.\nCampaigners spent 10 years lobbying for the project and, in 2018, \u00c2\u00a398m of government funding was granted by the chancellor.\nRichard Goffin, director of Peel Ports Great Yarmouth, said: \"We expect the bridge will offer an enhanced access to the supply chain which the port supports, but also the tourism businesses on the seafront.\"\nWhat type of bridge is it?\nThe double-leaf bascule bridge has an opening, known as a navigational envelope, for river traffic.\nIt opens in the middle to allow river traffic taller than 4.5m (15ft) through.\nMarine traffic must have permission to pass from the bridge control team - even if the bridge does not need to be opened.\nRiver users up to 50m (165ft) wide have been able to pass under the bridge since November.\nIf traffic is busy on the bridge, waiting pontoons are available on the western side of the river, for yachts and pleasure craft to moor up.\nIf one leaf has technical issues affecting a lift, the other leaf can open independently to allow some vessels through.\nThe bascule bridge was made in two halves by a specialist firm in Belgium, before being transported by sea and up the River Yare to be installed.\nA floating crane lifted the the bridge span into place in March 2023.\nWhy was the project delayed?\nThe bridge was supposed to open in September 2023.\nThe first setback came in February when a 250kg (551lb) World War Two bomb was discovered by construction workers during dredging work.\nThe bomb detonated a few days later, when attempts were being made to defuse it. No-one was injured although there was some damage to a flood wall.\nWork on the bridge resumed 10 days after the blast.\nThe second delay followed the discovery by builders of a potential vole burrow , close to where the crossing was being built, in July.\nIt led to work having to be temporarily halted for a few weeks, as voles are protected by law under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.\nNo voles were found following an exploration.\nWhere is the bridge?\nHerring Bridge is near William Adams Way and connects Harfrey's Roundabout (A47) in the Southtown area of the town on the west side of the River Yare to the peninsula of Great Yarmouth on the east side, at South Denes Road (A1243).\nThe east side of Herring Bridge is built on a sand bank; the west side on what is effectively the mudflats of a river estuary.\nSeveral buildings were demolished in the port area to allow the creation of new approach road structures.\nWhy is it called Herring Bridge?\nThe name was chosen by the public following a vote and has its roots in the town's fishing industry.\nThe town once boasted a large fishing fleet, with bumper catches of herring responsible for the area's wealth in the 1900s.\nNearly 6,000 votes were cast in the naming poll, with Herring Bridge receiving 2,710 votes.\nQueen's Gate, Britannia Bridge, Yare Bridge and King's Bridge were the other choices.\nMembers of the public were invited to apply for tickets to take part in the opening ceremony.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "The mother of Brianna Ghey said she had \"never felt such grief\" as her daughter's killers were sentenced to life for murder.\nScarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe repeatedly stabbed the 16-year-old, who was transgender, after luring her to a park in Cheshire in February 2023.\nBrianna had 28 knife wounds and the pair blamed each other for the murder.\nEsther Ghey told Manchester Crown Court Jenkinson and Ratcliffe would always \"pose a danger to society\".\nTrial judge Mrs Justice Yip told Jenkinson, 16, she would serve a minimum term of 22 years before parole.\nRatcliffe, also 16, was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years before parole.\nIn a victim impact statement read out in court before the sentences were handed down, Ms Ghey said of the killers: \"I would never want them to have the opportunity to carry out their sadistic fantasies on another child.\"\nShe added the \"hardest thing\" to come to terms with was finding out that one of those charged with Brianna's murder was someone she believed to be her daughter's friend.\nAt Manchester Crown Court, in her victim impact statement, Brianna's sister Alisha Ghey said she now struggled to trust new people because it was \"Brianna's friend who she trusted who ended her life\".\n\"No-one can ever make me feel better.

I was saying: 'We agreed before we started. I have paid for this'.\"\nMs Caldwell got away and was said to be \"upset\" before walking off.

    "It was the email Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) executive members had been waiting for and it arrived on Friday night.\nThe 130 members were promised a briefing by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson before any deal to return to Stormont was made public.\nIt appears the party leader is now fulfilling that pledge.\nSo far Sir Jeffrey has been focused on meeting his \"seven tests\" for a Stormont return.\nBut at the meeting of the party executive on Monday night will come test number eight, which could be be the most difficult of the lot.\nIn the email announcing the meeting, the party's chief executive apologised for the short notice .\nHe blamed \"circumstances beyond our control\" but then quoted the rule under which party officers have the power to call a meeting at short notice \"waiving the normal notice period\".\nMaybe he was mindful the decision to arrange the gathering could be challenged by some worried about the outcome.\nHe then went on to say the party leader wished to \"provide a detailed update on the current political situation\", and added that members should make every effort to attend.\nThen in bold, underlined writing he told members the meeting would be at \"a secure venue\" but they would have to wait until Monday to get details of the exact location.\nPlea for secrecy\nThe secrecy indicates just how sensitive this gathering is on Monday, but also reassures those attending that the party is trying to protect members from the glare of the media.\nJust to reinforce that point, in the next line members were asked not to \"discuss the business with those outside the party or the press and media\".\nBut that plea was quickly ignored by some.\nWithin minutes of the email dropping in members' inboxes, the message was screenshotted and posted on Twitter by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson.\nHe has warned the DUP against striking a deal with the government and it is clear there are some on the party executive who share the same view - those Sir Jeffrey accused of \"stirring\" in his Commons speech during the week.\nIt is likely the details of the \"secure venue\" will also be leaked when they are shared with members on Monday.\nThat will present a headache for the party leadership who will be keen to avoid a repeat of a previous executive showdown at the Crowne Plaza in Belfast.\n'Plotting a path'\nBack then party divisions were laid bare in front of the media when some executive members walked out during a bruising leadership contest.\nThis time the stakes for the DUP are even higher as Sir Jeffrey made clear the future of the union could hinge on the party's decision on whether or not to return to Stormont.\nSir Jeffrey is clearly now plotting a path back to power-sharing but other plotters within the party are working to a different plan.\nIt seems that group does not include Edwin Poots, who hinted this week he was up for a return to Stormont\nHe told the BBC's Nolan Show \"why we would have done what we have done for the past two years and go back with nothing?\"\nHe also hit out at those who have accused the party of being \"traitors\", describing them as \"idiots\".\nIf Sir Jeffrey is to get the support of the party executive then the backing of his former leader is key.\nBut even before party executive members gather on Monday, party officers may have already taken the decision to accept the deal on the table and return to Stormont.\nThe officers have the mandate to make that decision regardless of the views of party executive members.\nIdeally Sir Jeffrey would like the full endorsement of the executive if a deal is on the table, and he may get it.\nBut will it come at a cost to party unity.\nThat depends on how loud those opposed to any deal shout.\nIf they go public with their opposition then that could be tricky for the leadership.\nMore likely they may hold back in the interest of not inflicting more internal injuries on a party still bruised by the last fall out.\nBut there is also every chance executive members will be surprised and pleased with what is on the table.\nThe party leadership has been bullish about the gains it has made in meeting those important \"seven tests\" Sir Jeffrey laid down as preconditions for a return to Stormont.\nDon't rule out a much smoother path back to power sharing for the party leadership than many have predicted if a final deal is presented.\nIf he passes Stormont, could be back up and running before the second anniversary of its collapse next weekend.",
    "A 2,700-year-old Iron Age blacksmith workshop unearthed in the Oxfordshire countryside has been described as an \"exceptionally rare\" find by experts.\nThe site was excavated at the headquarters of environmental charity Earth Trust at Wittenham Clumps, near Abingdon.\nThe dig found artefacts including hearth lining and an intact tuyere, part of the ironworking process.\nThe Earth Trust said it revealed \"more of the ancient mysteries\" of the area.\nThe site is close to an area that previously yielded evidence of Roman, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements.\nArchaeologists from DigVentures, which carried out the excavation between 2018 and 2020, said they had discovered almost every component of the blacksmith's workshop.\nThese included the building, internal structures, hearth lining, tuyere and even tiny bits of metal that fly off when the blacksmith is hammering the metal.\nRadiocarbon dating revealed the smithy dated from 771-515 BC, soon after ironworking first arrived in Britain around 800 BC.\nGerry McDonnell, the archaeometallurgical specialist who examined the finds, said the intact tuyere - a pipe used to to blow air into a forge - was one of the few known examples of its kind in Europe.\n\"The fact that it dates not just to the Iron Age, but to the first few centuries of ironworking in Britain, is remarkable,\" he said.\n\"What's more, the size of it suggests we're looking at a hearth that was much larger and more specialised than that of your average village smithy.\n\"The fact that this early Iron Age smithy had a specialist tuyere shows us this was much more likely to have been a serious operation by a highly skilled, elite, or master blacksmith.\"\nHe said it would have been used to make swords, tools, wagon wheels, and other high-value objects.\nNat Jackson, site director at DigVentures, said the finds were \"remarkable\".\n\"It's an incredible thrill to uncover something like this,\" he said.\n\"It basically allows us to peer back in time and see what could have been one of Britain's earliest master blacksmiths at work.\"\nExcavations at the site also revealed an Iron Age settlement including a cluster of roundhouses, an Iron Age pantry, and evidence of ceremonial or ritual activity including animal burials, as well as a later Roman villa where archaeologists found the remains of a tiny Roman pet dog .\nThe finds from the excavation are due to go on display on 17 and 18 February during a Festival of Discovery at the Earth Trust Visitor Centre.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , Twitter , or Instagram .

    "Bristolians are being asked for help solving a mystery involving the iconic neon sign of the former Mauretania pub.\nIt was first erected by vintner Ronald Avery in 1939 after he fitted out the building with interiors from the famous ship RMS Mauretania.\nNow the owners are keen to know the exact movement of the waves and steam on the image of the luxury liner.\nIt was the first moving sign in the city when it was put up in the 1930s.\n\"I've spent my life loving it,\" said Kit Breech, \"but I don't think it's quite perfect yet.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Bristol he said: \"As a child you just see the bright light and that's what you look for when you come up Park Street.\n\"I just think it's sort of iconic and being a historic city of ships, it's perfect that it's a ship.\"\nThe Grade II-listed pub was built on Park Street in 1870 by Henry Masters.\nIn the 1930s Mr Avery bought fixtures and fittings from the cruise liner at auction and kitted out his pub.\nThe bar was panelled with quantities of richly carved African mahogany, which came from the first class lounge.\n\"I think he basically heard about the scrappage and he loves history,\" said Mr Avery's granddaughter, Mimi.\n\"He had this space and I can only imagine he thought, that's a good idea.\n\"He ended up with seven eating and drinking establishments in the building, most of which were kitted out with bits and pieces from the Mauretania,\" she added.\nThe neon sign was displayed on the south wall, facing the city centre.\nIt underwent refurbishment in 2018 by Cabot Neon Signs of Bristol. The company looked through old footage of news reels and scoured the internet for photographs to find out which parts were static and which parts moved.\nHowever, Mr Breech still thinks the sequence may not be quite right, and is asking local people for help.\n\"If anyone has any video footage of the sign, I'd really like to see that,\" he said.\nRMS Mauretania was retired by Cunard in 1934.\nIn the early part of the 20th century it was one of the company's \"Big Three\" liners - the other two were the Berengaria and Aquitania - which were the primary means of passenger transport across the Atlantic.\nThe luxury liner was famous for its speed, for many years holding the record for the quickest trans-Atlantic crossing.\n\"Although the Titanic was famous for being huge, and sunk by an iceberg, it was actually not as impressive a ship because it was slow. It was wallowy (sic), but the Mauretania just ripped along,\" said Mr Breech.\nIn July 1913, King George and Queen Mary were given a special tour of RMS Mauretania, then Britain's fastest merchant vessel, adding further distinction to the ship's reputation.\nShe also played a vital role during World War One. During the Gallipoli campaign she served as a troop carrier and hospital ship, later transporting soldiers across the Atlantic when America joined the war.\nMauretania is mentioned in Rudyard Kipling's poem \"The Secret of the Machines\" and she is also alluded to in James Cameron's movie \"Titanic\".\nFollow BBC West on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Director Jonathan Glazer says he borrowed techniques from reality TV, with a hidden crew and fixed cameras, for his film about Auschwitz concentration camp.\nBut his Oscar-nominated movie, The Zone of Interest, does not show the horrors of mass murder.\nInstead, it focuses on the family living next door - camp commandant Rudolf H\u00c3\u00b6ss , his wife Hedwig and their five children.\nH\u00c3\u00b6ss ran Auschwitz between 1940 and 1943, and used poisonous insecticide Zyklon B to gas prisoners.\nAn estimated 1.1 million were murdered there, one million of whom were Jews.\nMeanwhile, just metres away, his family enjoyed their spacious house, plentiful food and manicured garden - separated from the camp by a concrete wall.\nGlazer, who made the film near the site in Auschwitz, chose to hint at the terrible events inside the camp.\nWe hear muffled screams, gunshots and the churn of machinery, while smoke from the crematoria billows overhead.\nThe family carry on next door as if nothing is happening, with Glazer using a fly-on-the-wall technique to film the actors.\n\"The phrase I kept using was 'Big Brother in the Nazi house',\" he says.\nReality TV shows like Big Brother filmed people without visible camera crews, but with participants being watched at all times.\n\"The idea of eavesdropping felt like the way to show the drama - although there is no drama,\" Glazer tells the BBC. \"It was a way of being in the house with them.\"\nHe rejected conventional filming methods, \"where you get caught up in the actor and close-ups... they were the wrong thing for this\".\nShot with natural lighting, it often looks like a documentary.\nThe film has been nominated for five Oscars , including best film, plus nine Baftas . Last year it won the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival.\nFootage of the actors was shot in a house not far from the original one, where the H\u00c3\u00b6ss family lived.\nThe director used 10 remotely operated cameras, while he and the crew watched from a nearby bunker.\nHe's correct in saying there is \"no drama\". The humdrum life of the family is not gripping in a conventional sense.\n\"There was no cosiness with the characters in the film-making,\" Glazer adds. \"No funny, warm moments.\"\n'Queen of Auschwitz'\nWe see Hedwig having friends over for coffee and being unpleasant to her housemaids, while the children play upstairs.\nMeanwhile, H\u00c3\u00b6ss is in his study, discussing designs for a more efficient crematorium to murder as many people as possible.\nThe juxtaposition is deliberately shocking.\n\"We need to see all of that at once, to feel like we're in that house with them,\" Glazer says.\nHedwig, who calls herself \"Queen of Auschwitz\", also sneaks into her bedroom to try on a fur coat taken from a Jewish prisoner. She even smears on bright red lipstick after finding it in the pocket.\nChristian Friedel agreed to play H\u00c3\u00b6ss despite previously turning down Nazi roles, including Adolf Hitler.\n\"Very often there are clich\u00c3\u00a9s of Nazis - brutal evils\", he says.\nHe preferred Glazer's approach.\n\"To me, it makes sense to change the perspective, looking through a window to observe these characters. I was curious, how is it to act in this way?\n\"Jonathan said to us, 'Please don't act. Be'.\"\n'A luxury situation'\nSandra H\u00c3\u00bcller, who plays Hedwig, is full of praise for Glazer's filming methods.\n\"It was really great to do - for me, personally, it was a luxury situation,\" she says.\nMaking films can sometimes bit \"a little bit boring\" - waiting around can mean you \"lose energy\".\nH\u00c3\u00bcller, who is nominated for a best actress Oscar for Anatomy of Fall, says the fixed cameras and lack of crew meant they could record long scenes \"without technical interruption\".\n\"To feel that we have all the time in the world... we were allowed to make mistakes,\" she says. \"I wish many projects could film in this way.\"\nMost reviews for the film have been positive, with The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw saying it \"pulls the banality of evil into pin-sharp focus\".\nGlazer, who is Jewish, is obviously aware that other movies have been made about Auschwitz, such as the award-winning Schindler's List, Sophie's Choice and Son of Saul.\nBut he \"connected\" with Martin Amis's novel The Zone of Interest, which he adapted.\n\"His book found a perspective that felt really extraordinary,\" the director says.\nHe did not want to feature Nazi brutality, because images of Auschwitz from documentaries, photographs and films are already \"seared in our minds\".\nBut that doesn't mean the audience escapes the camp's horrors.\nGlazer, whose other films include Under the Skin and Sexy Beast, knew \"the sound would deliver the perpetual atrocity going on - out of sight, but never out of mind for us\".\nSound designer Johnnie Burn did \"months of meticulous research\".\n\"We viewed the project as two films: one you see, akin to a family drama or Big Brother; and one you only hear, coming from over the wall - the real narrative,\" he says.\nThe most difficult sound to reproduce was \"the omnipresent, mechanical hum of the camp's machinery - a harrowi",

    "Rugby bosses who asked for a financial lifeline have been told by First Minister Mark Drakeford that the Welsh government is willing to talk to them.\nThe Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) is asking for \"breathing space\" to help repay an \u00c2\u00a318m Covid loan to Welsh ministers.\nMr Drakeford told the Conservative Senedd leader his government would look at what could be done, but the WRU had borrowed money on commercial terms.\nAndrew RT Davies had asked whether the loan could be restructured.\nAt question time in Cardiff Bay, Mr Davies said that the Welsh government should make sure that \"there isn't that burden placed on the grassroots game within Wales, should the WRU have to make cutbacks,\" he said.\nMr Drakeford said the Welsh government had \"stepped in as the lender of last resort\" when the WRU \"weren't able to sustain\" payments on an earlier Covid loan.\n\"When you are dealing with public money, even when you are dealing with organisations that are as important in Welsh life as Welsh rugby is, you still have to make sure that those loans are being made on properly commercial terms,\" he said.\nHe added: \"While we are always prepared, and have been prepared, to talk to the union about whether the loan can be restructured - whether there are other ways we can assist - in the end this was a commercially-determined loan, conditions inherited from the UK coronavirus assistance and entered into freely by the WRU itself.\"\nSuch a loan would not be available from a bank \"so they are already at an advantage in that way, but that doesn't mean we are not willing to talk to them and see if there's anything else that can be done\".\nIt follows an appearance by rugby bosses at the Senedd's Culture and Sport Committee last week.\nSenedd members were told the interest rate on the loan's repayments had risen to 8.5%.\nWRU chair Richard Collier-Keywood said the repayments cost \u00c2\u00a32m a year and were having a \"very severe\" effect on the four professional sides: Ospreys, Cardiff, Scarlets and Dragons.\n\"If we do not get that breathing space we are going to a Plan B as yet undefined,\" he said.",
    "A court in Hong Kong has ordered the liquidation of debt-laden Chinese property giant Evergrande.\nJudge Linda Chan said \"enough is enough\", after the troubled developer repeatedly failed to come up with a plan to restructure its debts.\nThe firm has been the poster child of China's real estate crisis with more than $300bn (\u00c2\u00a3236bn) of debt.\nBut it is unclear how far the Hong Kong ruling will hold sway in mainland China.\nThe property giant, which has been in hot water with its creditors for the last two years, filed a request for another three months' leeway at 4pm on Friday.\nBut Judge Chan turned it down, describing the idea as \"not even a restructuring proposal, much less a fully formulated proposal\". Instead she ordered the start of the process to unwind Evergrande, appointing liquidators at Alvarez & Marsal Asia to oversee it.\nThe liquidators said their intention was to \"achieve a resolution that minimises further disruption for all stakeholders\".\n\"Our priority is to see as much of the business as possible retained, restructured, or remain operational,\" said Wing Sze Tiffany Wong, one of the managing directors.\nThe slowburn crisis at Evergrande has sent shockwaves through the investment community, with its potential impact likened to the collapse of Lehman Brothers at the start of the financial crisis.\nChina's property sector remains fragile as investors wait to see what approach Beijing will take to the court's move.\nThe decision is likely to send further ripples through China's financial markets at a time when authorities are trying to curb a stock market sell-off .\nEvergrande shares fell by more than 20% in Hong Kong after the announcement, before trading was suspended .\nThe liquidators will look at Evergrande's overall financial position and identify potential restructuring strategies. That could include seizing and selling off assets, so that the proceeds can be used to repay outstanding debts.\nHowever, Beijing may be reluctant to see work halt on property developments in China, where many ordinary would-be homeowners are waiting for apartments they have already paid for .\nEvergrande has come to symbolise the rollercoaster ride of China's property boom and bust, borrowing heavily to finance the building of forests of tower blocks aimed at housing the millions of migrants moving from rural areas to cities. It ran into trouble, and defaulted on its debts in December 2021.\nEvergrande's chairman, Hui Ka Yan, hit the headlines for his lavish lifestyle, before it was announced last year that he was under investigation for suspected crimes.\nOrdinary Chinese property buyers have limited options to demand compensation, but many have taken to social media to express their frustration about developers like Evergrande.\nBig investors have turned to the courts, including in Hong Kong, where Evergrande's shares are listed. The case that resulted in Monday's ruling was brought in June 2022 by Hong Kong-based Top Shine Global, which said that Evergrande had not honoured an agreement to buy back shares.\nEvergrande's executive director, Shawn Siu, described the decision to appoint liquidators as \"regrettable\", but told Chinese media the company would ensure home building projects would be delivered.\nThe unwinding is likely to take some time and construction is expected to continue in the meantime.\nMost of Evergrande's assets - 90% according to Judge Chan's ruling - are in mainland China and despite the \"one country, two systems\" slogan, there are thorny jurisdictional issues.\nAhead of Monday's ruling, China's Supreme Court and Hong Kong's Department of Justice signed an arrangement to mutually recognise and enforce civil and commercial judgements between mainland China and Hong Kong.\nBut experts are still unsure whether that agreement will have an impact on Evergrande's liquidation order.\nDerek Lai, the global insolvency leader at professional services firm Deloitte said the liquidator would need to \"follow the laws of mainland China\", which could make it hard to take full control of Evergrande's operations there.\nBeijing may want to see mainland building projects completed to meet the expectations of Chinese buyers and investors.\nForeign creditors are unlikely to get their money before mainland creditors.\nHowever, even if Judge Chan's orders are not carried out in China, the decision sends a strong message and gives a clue on what other developers and creditors may face.\nShe presides over not just Evergrande's case, but also other defaulted developers such as Sunac China, Jiayuan and Kaisa.\nLast May, she also ordered the liquidation of Jiayuan after its lawyers failed to explain why they needed more time to iron out their debt restructuring proposal.",

The aim of the new law is to regulate the largest companies that are gatekeepers to services such as search engines and app stores to make the market fairer for established companies and smaller firms.\nThe changes will not apply in the UK at this stage - although the UK's Digital Markets Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, is likely to put Apple's practices under similar regulatory scrutiny.\nEpic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said on X there was a lot of \"hot garbage in Apple's announcement\".\nThese include, he said, \"junk fees on downloads\".\nHe may be referring to the core technology fee , which charges developers of apps that are downloaded by over a million people.\nDevelopers will have to pay \u00e2\u0082\u00ac0.50 for every user who downloads their app, after the first million downloads.\nThis is a charge to the makers of apps, not to the customers.\nBrowser choice\nApple also said it would further open up browser choice, so that EU users will be able to opt out of using the firm's Safari web browser from the very first time they open it.\nBut it warned that while it was setting high standards for all new alternative apps and stores, it believed the move would create additional security risks for customers, and increase their risk of being exposed to malware, fraud and scams hidden within apps from other places.\n\"The changes we're announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act's requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings,\" Apple said.\nThe US tech giant sells premium-priced products, with the promise that they offer an extra layer of security.\nIt said: \"For apps that use alternative payment processing, Apple will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud.\"\nAndroid apps can already come from a wider variety of stores. However, as a result, malware is far more common on Android devices than Apple ones.\nThe purpose of both the new EU rules and UK proposals are to try to maintain open and competitive markets where lots of companies can successfully operate alongside each other.",

    "Two years after he was ousted in a no-confidence vote, Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan continues to loom large over the country's politics.\nEven though the 71-year-old is barred from running in the 8 February general election, he continues to be a powerful force dividing the Muslim majority country. For some of its 240 million population, he is an anti-establishment hero. To his opponents, he is power-hungry and corrupt.\nKhan first rose to international fame on the cricket pitch, before shedding his playboy past and embarking on a decade-long marriage with billionaire heiress Jemima Goldsmith in a story captured in the pages of Hello! magazine.\nHis career in politics began soon after, but it took years for him to make a serious impression. By the time he was elected PM in July 2018 he had long cultivated an image as a pious reformer and widened his appeal with promises to fight corruption and fix the ailing economy.\nBarely four years in, he was kicked out of office by opponents in parliament, making him the first prime minister in Pakistan's history to be ousted in a vote of no-confidence.\nPakistanis were frustrated that his pledges to build an \"Islamic welfare state\" went unmet - leaving them to pay through their noses for food. Reports also said he had fallen out of favour with the powerful military, a crucial behind-the-scenes player in the nuclear-armed country.\nImran Khan's lawyers say he is now battling more than 170 legal cases, including charges for corruption and terrorism. He calls the charges a politically-motivated attempt to keep him off the ballot.\nBut he still commands considerable support - tens of thousands took to the streets in cities across Pakistan on the night he was ejected from power. Supporters also came out in widespread protests - at times violent - after he was arrested in May 2023 on corruption charges. Some people even stormed army cantonments, which incensed the powerful military.\nThe unrest plunged Pakistan deeper into political turmoil at a time when its economy is already on life support. His detention was later ruled illegal by the courts, but in August 2023 Khan was taken into custody again after being found guilty of not declaring details about gifts he received in office.\nHe is appealing against a three-year jail sentence. The conviction barred him from standing in the general elections. Just a week before the vote, the sentences began piling up as the courts handed down two more jail terms in as many days to Khan , including a 14-year term for illegally profiting from state gifts. His wife Bushra Bibi was also jailed 14 years in that same case.\nEarlier in January Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had suffered another serious setback when the Supreme Court upheld a decision to strip the party of its cricket bat symbol. Such symbols allow the many millions of illiterate voters to pick out their party without having to read a name.\nBut Khan has shown no signs of wanting to leave politics. The PTI said its candidates are determined to stand in the vote, even if they have to do so as independents. Its leader continues campaigning even from jail using an artificial intelligence voice clone .\n'Change' candidate\nLong one of Pakistan's best-known faces internationally, Imran Khan struggled for years to turn popular support into electoral gains.\nIn 1996, he launched Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf - which means Movement for Justice. But it was not until the 2011 general election that the PTI and its leader emerged as serious political contenders.\nHe was seen as a \"change\" candidate, whose promise to raise a whole new class of clean politicians chimed with voters disillusioned with the old political order. Seven years later a swing of epic proportions propelled him to power .\nThe PTI made huge gains in Punjab, its rivals' Nawaz and Shehbaz Sharif's bastion. The province holds more than half of the 272 directly-elected National Assembly seats.\nImran Khan spoke of his dream of building a \"new Pakistan\" where wealth was shared. He made ambitious promises that included reforming the country's tax system and bureaucracy.\n\"I pledge that, God willing, there will be a different kind of governance in Pakistan,\" he said then.\nInstead, inflation soared, the rupee plummeted and Pakistan became crippled by debt, stoking anger and criticism that he had mishandled the economy.\nHe ended up negotiating a $6bn (\u00c2\u00a34.75bn) rescue bailout from the International Monetary Fund in 2019 to address a balance of payments crisis.\nThe former cricket captain had hoped to see out a full, five-year term, something no other prime minister had ever done in a country with a history of coups and military rule.\nBut by late March 2022, a series of defections had deprived him of his parliamentary majority and the opposition pounced, tabling a motion of no confidence.\nKhan sought to circumvent the move by having parliament dissolved and calling a snap election, but the Supreme Court ruled this was in breach of",

    "Rishi Sunak's flagship Rwanda bill has faced strong criticism during its first debate in the House of Lords.\nPeers including the Archbishop of Canterbury attacked the principles of the bill, while the Liberal Democrats tried to kill it entirely.\nThat move failed with the House of Lords voting to allow the bill to move to the next stage by 206 votes to 84.\nHowever, peers have indicated they will try to strip out key powers as the bill progresses.\nThe government's plan aims to halt legal challenges against sending asylum seekers to Rwanda.\nSpeaking at the end of the debate, Labour's Home Office spokesman Lord Vernon Coaker said that while his party opposed the bill, it was the unelected House of Lords' job to scrutinise and amend legislation, but not to block it.\nThe bill has now cleared its first hurdle in the upper chamber. Key votes on the legislation in the Lords are not expected until next month.\nAny changes made by peers are likely to be overturned by the Commons.\nThe government is hoping to get the flights to Rwanda running by the spring.\n'Shoddy' bill\nDuring the debate, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the bill was \"damaging\" to the UK's reputation, to \"national unity\" and to asylum seekers \"who are in need of protection\".\nThis bill \"obscures the truth that all people, asylum seekers included, are of great value\" he said.\nThe archbishop said he would not vote against the bill at second reading, but told peers the UK \"can do better\".\nLabour's former home secretary Lord David Blunkett called the bill \"shoddy and less than this country deserves\".\nLord Blunkett argued the Rwanda Bill fails its main purpose because it \"punishes\" asylum seekers, not smuggling gangs.\nTo stop smuggling boats, Lord Blunkett said Britain needs to \"get its act together\" by securing borders, processing claims and making new deals with the French.\nHowever, Conservative Lord Hannan, a former MEP, said the bill was \"imperfect\" but was part of a \"package of measures\" that would act as a deterrent, curbing the demand for illegal migration to the UK.\nFormer minister and Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost expressed support for the bill, arguing that the government was \"right to do what is necessary to re-establish control\" over illegal immigration.\n\"We have no obligation to take in just anybody who shows up.\"\nFormer Conservative Chancellor Lord Ken Clarke said the bill would endanger the UK's constitution.\nDeclaring Rwanda a safe country is \"trying to overturn\" the facts found by the Supreme Court, which ruled the country was unsafe for asylum seekers, he said. The government might as well rule \"all dogs are cats\", he added.\nCrossbench peer and leading lawyer Lord Carlile said there was \"plenty of evidence that Rwanda is not a safe country\" and the government was \"asking us to legislate a lie\".\nThe former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation said he would only support the bill if concerns raised by peers about Rwanda's asylum procedures were resolved.\nAhead of the debate, Downing Street insisted the Rwanda Bill was the \"right thing to do\".\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This bill is a key part of how we stop violent criminal gangs targeting vulnerable people that has led to too many deaths in the English Channel.\n\"It is also the fair thing to do both for taxpayers and for those individuals seeking to come here through safe and legal routes who see their place jumped by those who can afford to make crossings on small boats.\"\nTory divisions\nThe prime minister was able to pass the bill through the Commons after a threatened Conservative rebellion failed to materialise.\nMr Sunak has argued deporting some asylum seekers to Rwanda will be a deterrent to migrants seeking to get to the UK by crossing the Channel in small boats, but Labour has labelled the plan an expensive \"gimmick\".\nDebate over the legislation has exposed on-going divisions among Conservatives - leading to two deputy chairmen, Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith, quitting their roles in order to vote for the rebel amendments.\nIn the final round of voting in the Commons on 18 January, more than 60 Conservative MPs backed rebel amendments to allow the UK government to ignore parts of human rights law when sending people to Rwanda.\nDozens of Tory MPs had suggested they would be willing to abstain or even vote against the entire bill without fundamental changes.\nHowever, in the event, just 11 MPs voted against it - including former immigration minister Robert Jenrick and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman.\nThe votes were a culmination of months of Conservative party infighting and coincided with a poll funded by an anonymous group called Conservative Britain Alliance - which projected Labour was on course for a 120-seat majority.\nTory pollster Lord Hayward has called for the Electoral Commission to look into polls pushed by groups with no credible identifiable \"beneficial owner\".",

    "A man who altered a drone to fly higher than it should has been fined \u00c2\u00a3500 for acting in a way which could endanger an air ambulance.\nAndrew Godwin, 56, of Witham Way, Peterborough, pleaded guilty to four charges relating to the illegal use of a drone last June.\nThe prosecution said Godwin used settings on the drone which failed to comply with English regulations.\nHis lawyer, Oliver Barrett, said his client accepted he had been an \"idiot\".\nThe hearing at Peterborough Magistrates' Court was told the defendant stopped the drone's warning sounds.\nProsecutor James Quelch said Godwin carried out the act in an area where the air ambulance took daily trips.\nHe said there was no suggestion a helicopter was there, but it was at a height where one could have been flying.\nThe drone was a small one, which did not require a licence.\nPolice turned up on doorstep\nThe court heard Godwin did not get much guidance when he bought it, and instead got information from other hobbyists.\nHe used binoculars to watch the drone and thought this was acceptable because it was in his line of sight.\nJudge Ken Sheraton said the drone had been up to three miles away from him when it was flying.\nMr Barrett said Godwin had not realised an air ambulance might have been in the skies, and the first he knew he had done anything wrong was when police turned up on his doorstep to arrest him.\nHe added his client had not set out to break the law.\nGodwin, who is semi-retired, said he would not use the drone again.\nHe admitted the following offences which took place in June 2023:\nGodwin was fined \u00c2\u00a3250 each for two offences, with no separate penalty for other charges.

    "People with seven common ailments such as sore throat and earache can go into a chemist to be assessed, rather than making an appointment with their GP.\nUnder the Pharmacy First scheme, pharmacists in England can carry out consultations and issue antibiotics when appropriate.\nThe aim is to make it easier for people to get the help they need and free up millions of GP appointments.\nSimilar services already exist in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nPharmacy groups have welcomed the move but there is concern over the number of chemists that have closed down, and funding for the scheme.\nWhat can pharmacists supply medicines for now?\nPatients can access the new service by walking straight into a chemist. They can also be referred by NHS 111, urgent treatment centres, emergency departments or their GP. Those who are not registered with a GP can still access the service.\nIf one of the seven conditions is diagnosed, pharmacists can give medicines to patients rather than sending them back to their GP. Patients who need more specialist or follow-up care will be referred onwards.\nPharmacies already offer advice on medicines - when to take them, information on side effects and how to dispose of them - and have always been somewhere patients can go for advice on symptoms.\nYou can also get emergency contraception and blood pressure checks at most pharmacies in England. Some offer advice on how to stop smoking, how to lose weight as well as screening and treatment for chlamydia, a common sexually-transmitted infection.\nWhat happens at a consultation?\nThe pharmacist will ask about symptoms and possibly about any previous medical issues. They may ask for consent to check the patient's health record if they can access it.\nFor some conditions, the pharmacist may perform an examination - for example of a patient's ear.\nThis allows them to recommend the best course of action for each patient, which could include a treatment bought over the counter such as a cream or ointment, a restricted set of prescription-only medicines or advice that the issue will go away on its own.\nThe consultation will be noted and shared with GPs to add to the patient's record.\nWill more antibiotics be given out?\nThere is a strict protocol in place for providing medicines for each of the seven conditions, says Tase Oputu, who chairs the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) in England.\nThat includes giving information, advice and symptom relief before supplying antibiotics, if needed.\nAntibiotics are used to treat or prevent bacterial infections, but do not work against viruses such as colds and flu.\nOveruse of them in the past has meant they are becoming less effective against serious infections - known as antimicrobial resistance.\nNHS England said the new service would be \"continually\" scrutinised in case there was any effect on that issue.\nIn Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where the service is already running, the RPS said there was no evidence of an increase in levels of antibiotics supplied.\n'More choice'\nMore than 90% of community chemists had registered to deliver the new service, NHS England said.\nThey have been paid \u00c2\u00a32,000 each and will receive \u00c2\u00a315 per consultation plus \u00c2\u00a31,000 a month if they see a set minimum number of patients.\nNHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard called it \"great news for patients\".\n\"GPs are already treating millions more people every month than before the pandemic - but with an ageing population and growing demand, we know the NHS needs to give people more choice and make accessing care as easy as possible,\" she said.\nThe RPS called it a \"leap forward\" in patient care.\n'Easier than staying on hold to GP'\nAde Williams, who trialled the scheme at Bedminster Pharmacy, in Bristol, told BBC News: \"One of the frustrations you have as a pharmacist is that you have patients coming in and then you want to help them - but then you are then not able to. It's a really big deal for us.\n\"You feel a greater sense of satisfaction and it's lovely when the patient comes back and says, 'I am better now - that worked'.\"\nAli McKerrow, whose young son was supplied with an impetigo cream at the pharmacy, says the scheme will help working parents.\n\"It can be really challenging getting a GP appointment,\" she said.\n\"I am about to do the school run and just popped in here on the way - that's infinitely easier than staying on the phone on hold.\"\nNearly half the pharmacies in England have also recently started prescribing the oral contraceptive pill.\nThey will also increase the number of blood pressure checks.\nBut there are concerns about pharmacy closures . Last year, BBC News analysis showed the number of chemists in England had fallen to its lowest level since 2015.\nAnd the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies has warned community pharmacies in England are \"severely underfunded\".\nChief executive Dr Leyla Hannbeck welcomed the scheme but said that without greater funding, \"more pharmacies will shut their doors for goo",

    "Spectacular sunrises have lit up the early morning skies on the North Yorkshire coast for the past few days.\nThe pink and purple panoramas have been captured by BBC Weather Watchers in Scarborough, Fylingthorpe and Filey.\nBBC Weather presenter Keeley Donovan said a combination of Saharan sand and salt from the sea were behind the meteorological phenomenon.\nBut, will the vibrant vistas fall foul of the old saying 'red sky in the morning, shepherd's warning'?\n\"We tend to get more vivid colours at sunrise and sunset because the sun is low in the sky and therefore the light travels further, and through more atmosphere,\" Keeley said.\n\"The blue light gets scattered away leaving more of the reds and yellows for us to see.\n\"Over the last week or so extra particles in the atmosphere could have enhanced the colours.\n\"For example earlier in the week there was some Saharan dust about and, after a number of Atlantic low pressure systems affected us, salt from the sea could have been suspended in the atmosphere.\n\"Salt particles are quite large so the light is scattered considerably leading to purple and pink colours.\n\"There has also been mid and high-level cloud rather than full cloud cover which would've prevented the beautiful scenes.\n\"It's also likely that now the sun is rising earlier more of us were up and about to see the sunrise.\"\nBut are the glorious sunrises a hint of stormy days ahead?\nKeeley said: \"This weather folklore is most reliable in the UK, because our prevailing wind direction is west to southwesterly, meaning our weather typically arrives from the Atlantic.

It is the second largest market of its kind in the world.\nIn anticipation of their arrival, police units with armoured vehicles had been deployed along the A6 motorway to the market, and police checkpoints were set up around its access points.\nThe protesters entered the market's storage area and caused damage before they were taken out by security forces, a source told AFP news agency.\nParis police chief Laurent Nunez said authorities \"cannot tolerate disturbances to public order\", BFMTV reported.\nEarlier, 18 people who were trying to blockade Rungis had been arrested for \"interfering with traffic\", police said.\nProsecutors said 15 of them were then taken into custody.\nIt comes as convoys of farmers' tractors have been blocking key roads into the French capital - dubbed the \"siege of Paris\" - over the past week.\nFrance has been at the centre of a growing dispute across Europe, with tens of thousands of farmers across Germany, Poland, Romania, Belgium and Italy also staging demonstrations.\nArnaud Rousseau, head of FNSEA, France's main agricultural union, said there are \"huge expectations\" among farmers, but that not all of their demands could be immediately met.\n\"I'm trying to call for calm and reasonableness,\" he added.\nThe protests have created a crisis for French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who is only three weeks into the job\nMr Attal said on Tuesday that his government stood ready to resolve the crisis and praised the agriculture sector as \"our force and our pride\".\nHe said \"new support measures\" would be announced in the coming days.",

    "The government's plans to give working parents in England extra help with childcare costs will begin to roll out in April.\nParents of two-year-olds are now able to apply for 15 hours of funded childcare during term time to start in the spring, but there have been concerns about IT issues, increased demand and underfunding.\nWho is eligible for 30 hours of free childcare, and how does it work?\nAt the moment, working parents of three and four-year-olds in England are eligible for 30 hours of free childcare per week during term time.\nIt is available for households where the parent or parents earn at least \u00c2\u00a38,670 a year, but less than \u00c2\u00a3100,000.\nIn the Spring Budget in March 2023, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said this scheme would be extended to cover younger children on a phased basis:\nApplications for the first phase have opened, but parents are advised to register between mid-January and the end of February.\nThe Department for Education said it has fixed an IT issue that left some parents unable to access codes needed to secure a place with a childcare provider in time. It said it will send all affected parents the information they need.\nWho is eligible for 15 hours of free childcare for two-year-olds?\nSome two-year-olds in England are already eligible for 15 hours per week of government-funded childcare during term time under certain circumstances, for example if the family receives universal credit.\nAll three and four-year-olds are entitled to 15 hours of childcare which can be used in private nurseries, state-run pre-schools or childminders.\nThe hours are available from the start of the term after the child reaches the relevant age.\nNot all private nurseries offer these hours, and some charge parents extra money on top to cover additional items such as nappies or snacks.\nWill there be enough childcare places?\nBBC analysis estimates that demand for childcare places is likely to have risen by about 15% by the time the expansion is in place. This is equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children requiring full-time care.\nChildcare places in England fell by 1% in 2023, mainly because of childminders leaving the sector , but the government says the population of pre-school children is also decreasing.\nThe government is offering a \u00c2\u00a3600 incentive for people to become childminders (or \u00c2\u00a31,200 via an agency) and started a recruitment campaign in January.\nFrom April, it is also increasing the amount it pays providers to deliver childcare to an average of \u00c2\u00a311.22 per hour for under-twos, \u00c2\u00a38.28 for two-year-olds, and \u00c2\u00a35.88 for three and four-year-olds.\nLocal authorities distribute the funding to nurseries and childminders, so the exact amount they receive depends on where they are based.\nBut even the increased amount paid by the government will not always cover the full cost.\nAn Education Select Committee report in July 2023 concluded that underfunding had left the sector \"straining to provide\" enough places.\nThe plans to expand funded childcare could allow 60,000 more parents of young children to enter the workforce, according to the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility.\nBut Paul Johnson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, predicted that plans would only help \"a few tens of thousands\" of parents return to work.\nWhat other financial childcare help is available?\nUnder the tax-free childcare scheme, the government pays \u00c2\u00a32 for every \u00c2\u00a38 families contribute, up to a maximum of \u00c2\u00a32,000 per child per year (\u00c2\u00a34,000 for disabled children).\nThe money can be used for approved childcare, including childminders, nurseries, nannies, and after-school clubs. It can be used as well as free childcare hours if parents qualify for both.\nFamilies claiming universal credit who are not using the tax-free childcare scheme can get back up to 85% of their childcare costs.\nUniversal credit recipients can claim \u00c2\u00a3951 each month for childcare for one child, and \u00c2\u00a31,630 for two or more.\nParents moving into paid work, or increasing their working hours, receive the support upfront, instead of having to reclaim it, as was previously the case.\nParents under 20 in England, who are at school or sixth form college, can also receive weekly payments under the Care to Learn scheme, worth \u00c2\u00a3180 per child per week outside London, or \u00c2\u00a3195 inside the capital.\nAre 15 and 30 free hours of childcare available across the UK?\nCurrently all three and four-year-olds are entitled to some free childcare throughout the UK.\nDifferent schemes operate in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland, but wherever you live, care must be delivered by officially-registered providers.\nHow expensive is UK childcare and how does it compare worldwide?\nThe average cost of full-time nursery (50 hours a week) for a child under two in Britain is nearly \u00c2\u00a315,000 a year, according to the charity Coram.

    "A crackdown on Manchester United fans who block residents' driveways and park anti-socially around Old Trafford has been proposed.\nMeasures put forward by Trafford Council include creating \"red routes\" across some roads by the stadium which would mean vehicles cannot stop.\nThe authority has been looking into how to stop nuisance parking on matchdays.\nTrafford councillor David Acton said the council had the powers to deliver the changes \"as soon as possible\".\nOther recommendations include partnering with Manchester United to try to resolve parking issues around the famous ground and setting up more places for fans to store bicycles in the areas.\nParking problems\nThe proposals were put forward by a task group set up by the council to look into the problem which received 438 responses from the public, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service .\nSpeaking at a recent council meeting, Mr Acton, a councillor for Labour, said it was \"no surprise\" that those who live near Old Trafford reported problems with traffic and anti-social parking.\nHe said Manchester United needed to be encouraged to increase bike storage at the stadium to \"increase cycling as an alternative\" to driving.\n\"This is because, with 74,000 people going there regularly on match days, there are very few cycling spaces provided,\" he said.\nCouncil leader Tom Ross said there was a \"lot of public interest\" in the issue.\n\"I declare an interest as someone who lives within the scope of that,\" he said.\n\"I'm impacted by matchday parking as well.\n\"There's some partnership work taking place between the ward councillors and the club and this helps us as we work together with Manchester United and improve the experience for residents living round there.\"\nThe club has been contacted for comment.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "A couple said they have been left in \"limbo\" after a school's application to fence-off their home was withdrawn.\nSharon and Mark Gobey have lived in a house within the grounds of Hadrian Academy in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, for 20 years.\nThe school withdrew plans to fence in their family home with a 5.9ft (1.8m) metal fence, although the couple said the application could be resubmitted.\nHadrian Academy said it had no further statement at this time.\nMrs Gobey suspects the \"school withdrew the application because they knew it was not going to work\".\n'Living in limbo'\nThe homeowners said they have seen the school's planner outside their property, which has led them to believe that new plans could be submitted.\nThey said: \"We have been living in limbo.

    "Ofsted should be reformed, and should move away from providing single-word judgements on schools, an inquiry by MPs has found.\nTheir report highlighted concerns raised by the inquest into head teacher Ruth Perry's suicide, which concluded that a critical Ofsted inspection \"contributed\" to her death.\nWhat does Ofsted stand for?\nOfsted - the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills - inspects and reports on anywhere that provide education for young people in England, including schools, nurseries and childminders.\nSchools or organisations are inspected every four years or 30 months depending on their status, and are then graded accordingly:\nMany parents rely on Ofsted ratings to help them choose a school or nursery.\nOfsted also inspects some independent schools in England, while others are assessed by the Independent Schools Inspectorate .\nInspections in Wales are carried out by Estyn, in Scotland by Education Scotland and in Northern Ireland by the Education and Training Inspectorate.\nWhat happens during an Ofsted inspection?\nDuring an Ofsted visit - which can last up to two days - inspectors observe lessons and talk to staff and pupils.\nThe school is normally notified the day before.\nSchools can request to defer or cancel a visit, but only in exceptional circumstances.\nInspectors judge schools according to Ofsted's education inspection framework.\nThey assess:\nThe final report gives the school one overall grade.\nWhy have lots of 'outstanding' schools been downgraded?\nSchools can be downgraded if they fail any one part of the inspection.\nThe Ofsted report for Caversham Primary School - where Ms Perry worked - described a \"welcoming and vibrant school\".\nBut it also highlighted failings in training, record-keeping and checks on staff.\nSchools that were rated good or outstanding used to be assessed every four years, but routine inspections for outstanding schools stopped in 2011, so resources could be focused on the worst-performing institutions.\nHowever, this meant some outstanding schools might not have been visited for more than a decade.\nIn 2020, the government restored routine inspections to provide more up-to-date information.\nThere were 3,400 outstanding schools in England in 2020, and Ofsted plans to reinspect them all by summer 2025.\nThe latest data from Ofsted shows that of the 358 outstanding schools visited between September 2023 and December 2023:\nOfsted previously acknowledged that many schools being reassessed had experienced \"significant change\" since their previous visit.\nWhat happens after an Ofsted inspection?\nSchools graded good or outstanding will be re-inspected after four years, but are also given recommendations on how to improve in the interim.\nAny school which requires improvement will be revisited within 30 months.\nSchools that are rated inadequate become sponsored academies, and are supported by another outstanding school or charity.\nHowever, under changes introduced in June 2023 , if a school is graded inadequate overall because of ineffective safeguarding, but all other judgements were good or outstanding, inspectors will return within three months to see if improvements have been made.\nCan schools complain about their Ofsted rating?\nHead teachers can challenge the rating their school is given.\nComplaints are dealt with by a senior inspector who was not involved in the original assessment .\nThe way Ofsted handles the post-inspection period will change in April 2024 , with the aim of resolving complaints more quickly, and increasing transparency around decision making.\nHow do critics want Ofsted inspections to change?\nThe Beyond Ofsted inquiry, chaired by former Schools Minister Lord Knight and funded by the National Education Union (NEU), called for \"transformational change\" .\nSeveral teaching unions want the current system of one-word grades to be replaced.\nEstyn in Wales and the body which inspects Church of England schools and academies have already moved away from this approach.\nAn inquiry by the Education Select Committee urged Ofsted's new chief inspector, Sir Martyn Oliver, and the government, to consider a more \"nuanced system that can provide value to both schools and parents\".\nProf Sonia Blandford, from Plymouth Marjon University highlights the time pressures of the current inspection regime, which scrutinises \"every aspect of the school\" in a very short period of time.\nShe says the 24-hour notice period also places considerable pressure on teaching staff.\nAfter the inquest into Ruth Perry's death, senior coroner Heidi Connor issued a prevention-of-future-deaths notice (PFD) , to help avoid further tragedies.\nMs Connor said she was concerned by \"the almost complete absence of Ofsted training\" for inspectors looking for signs of distress in school leaders.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) promised to work with Ofsted to improve the system.\nAll Ofsted visits were halted for a fortnight in January to give lead inspectors mental health awareness train",
    "A new bereavement room has opened at a hospital following fundraising by supporters including a couple who had stillborn twins.\nEmma and Jordan Fellows from Coventry said they were determined that some good should come from their experience.\nThe new Dandelion Room on the labour ward at University Hospital in Coventry is sound-proofed to make it feel private for grieving parents.\nMrs Fellows said she wanted to help make a change.\nShe lost her twins during pregnancy last year. They were delivered stillborn at the hospital on 18 June.\nSince then the couple have been able to raise \u00c2\u00a318,000 for the new facility and have also been furnishing the room with a floral blanket, LED candles, a docking station and a coffee machine. The room is also due to get a pull-out bed.\nMr Fellows said: \"That's something I wanted to insist on, because when I was there we didn't really have a bed to start with for the fathers going in.\"\nThe couple have also brought in a journal and written their own story in it.

    "The Bank of England has held interest rates at 5.25% for the fourth time in a row, but cuts are expected later in the year.\nInterest rates move up and down in order to control UK inflation, which has come down sharply in recent months, easing cost-of-living pressures.\nHowever, the UK economy has been stagnating amid increased borrowing costs and other pressures.\nInterest rates set by the Bank of England affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK.\nWhat are interest rates and why do they change?\nThe Bank of England's base rate, currently 5.25%, is what it charges other lenders to borrow money.\nThis has a knock-on effect on what other banks charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest they pay on savings.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee meets eight times a year to decide what the base rate should be.\nIt has a target to keep UK inflation at 2%. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising across the economy as a whole .\nWhen inflation is going up, the Bank may decide to raise rates to encourage people to spend less . The idea is that this helps bring inflation down by dampening demand.\nOnce this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them.\nHow do interest rates affect me?\nMortgages\nJust under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey .\nWhen interest rates rise or fall, more than 1.4 million people on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) deals usually see an immediate change in their monthly payments.\nAbout three-quarters of mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. Their monthly payments aren't immediately affected when the Bank changes rates, but future deals are.\nAlthough mortgage rates have been lower recently, they are still much higher than they have been for much of the last decade.\nThis means homebuyers and those remortgaging will have to pay a lot more than if they had taken out the same mortgage a few years ago.\nAbout 1.6 million deals will expire in 2024, according to banking trade body UK Finance.\nYou can see how your mortgage may be affected by interest rate changes by using our calculator:\nCredit cards and loans\nBank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans.\nLenders could decide to put their rates up, if they expect higher interest rates from the Bank of England, but if rates fall, interest payments may get cheaper.\nSavings\nThe Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers can earn on their money.\nIndividual banks and building societies have been under pressure to pass on higher interest rates to customers.\nThere are some good deals on the market, so analysts say that customers should shop around, as money may be in accounts paying little or no interest.\nThe UK's financial watchdog warned banks will face \"robust action\" if they offer unjustifiably low savings rates to their customers .\nWhen will UK interest rates go down?\nThe Bank rate is currently at its highest level for nearly 16 years.\nHowever, the rate was higher than this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and was running at 17% in November 1979 .\nAfter the latest meeting of policymakers, there were plenty of questions about why interest rates have not been cut, with the rate of inflation dropping sharply.\nInflation was running at 4% in December 2023 , down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, although still twice the Bank's target.\nGovernor Andrew Bailey said it would wait for firm evidence that inflation was under control before it goes further to cut rates.\nThe Bank has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy - which has shown little sign of growth - by keeping rates high.\nAre other countries raising their interest rates?\nInterest rates have also been increasing across the world.\nHowever, in recent months, other central banks - including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank - have also paused their rate rises.\nThe UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called \"advanced\" economies.",

    "Three US troops have been killed and dozens injured in a drone attack on a US base near Jordan's border with Syria.\nUS President Joe Biden said the attack was carried out by \"radical Iran-backed militant groups\". He added: \"We shall respond.\"\nIran has denied any involvement in the attack.\nIt is the first time that a strike has killed US troops in the region since Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.\nJordan says the attack took place in Syria, not inside Jordan.\nThere have been other attacks on US bases in the region, but before Sunday there were no fatalities, according to the US military.\nIt is not clear who is behind this latest attack.\nPresident Biden said the US \"will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing\".\nIran denied US and British accusations that it supported militant groups blamed for the strike.\n\"These claims are made with specific political goals to reverse the realities of the region,\" foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said, according to Tehran's official IRNA news agency.\nThe White House said Mr Biden was briefed Sunday morning on the attack by US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and other officials.\n\"Jill and I join the families and friends of our fallen - and Americans across the country - in grieving the loss of these warriors in this despicable and wholly unjust attack,\" Mr Biden said in a statement.\nThe names of the servicemen killed and injured have not yet been released as officials work to notify their families.\nOn a visit to South Carolina, Mr Biden said \"we had a tough day last night in the Middle East. We lost three brave souls\".\nUS officials say at least 34 military personnel were being evaluated for possible traumatic brain injury, and that some of the injured soldiers were medically evacuated from the base for further treatment.\nThey also say that the drone struck the living quarters, which, if confirmed, could explain the high number of casualties.\nUS Central Command and President Biden said the attack was on a base in northeastern Jordan, near the Syrian border. It was later named by US officials as Tower 22.\nA Jordanian government spokesman, Muhannad Moubaideen, however, told state TV that the attack targeted al-Tanf base in Syria.\nIn December, US officials said that US bases in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 97 times since 17 October.\nLast month, the US carried out airstrikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US servicemembers were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.\nEarlier in January, one retaliatory US strike in Baghdad killed a militia leader accused of being behind attacks on US personnel.\nIn a pre-recorded interview with ABC News that aired on Sunday morning, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen CQ Brown said that America's aim in the region is to \"not have the conflict broaden\".\n\"The goal is to deter them and we don't want to go down a path of greater escalation that drives to a much broader conflict within the region.\"\nUS and coalition troops are also stationed in the Red Sea after the Iran-backed Houthis began attacking commercial ships in the region.

    "Fail to buy the latest cuddly toy or collectable action figure and there will be tears and tantrums - and that's just the grown-ups.\nSales to so-called \"kidults\" rose by 6% last year, bucking the 5% downturn in toy sales as a whole in the UK.\nAdopting a \"can't beat them, join them\" approach means this group is buying enough games and toys to account for more than a quarter of the market.\nAnalysts suggest that is now worth more than \u00c2\u00a31bn a year.\n\"The main reasons adults said they were buying for themselves was because toys were fun and also good for their mental health,\" said Melissa Symonds, executive director at toy data tracking company Circana.\nNever too old\nToy manufacturers and retailers had a year to forget last year, with the number of sales down by 7% and a 5% drop in the value of toy trading.\nA wet summer particularly hit outdoor toys and games sales, while cost of living pressures put a lid on small, impulse buys.\nHowever, the UK market remains one of the biggest in Europe, worth \u00c2\u00a33.5bn last year.\nThe annual Toy Fair, a three-day trade show at London's Olympia, has just ended. Observers would have noted that many of the big companies are increasingly targeting a range of age groups, not just primary and pre-schoolers.\nKidults are defined as aged 12 and over, but Ms Symonds said it was the over 18s driving the increase in sales to this group.\nGareth Edwards, a self-confessed kidult in his late 50s, was exhibiting his board and card games at the show.\n\"I have been collecting board games for 43 years, since I was aged 14,\" he said. \"I've got over 1,000 in three rooms of the house. So, I thought why not design one?\".\nThe proceeds are intended for his animal rescue centre charity in County Durham, and others that he supports.\nVariety to a game, he said, was the secret to a successful one.\nThe enthusiasm of older players, via specialist events, shops and cafes accounts for part of the rise in popularity of kidult games. Lockdown days during the pandemic also saw families stuck at home dust off the games cupboard.\nAdam Turner, founder of game distribution business Aleto Games, is another exhibitor who turned his hobby into a business.\n\"There were games that I played and enjoyed that were hard to get hold of in this country,\" he said, explaining his motivation for the business.\nHowever, it is not just board games that are driving the rise of sales to kidults. Action figures, collectables, and building sets such as Lego are all appealing to older consumers.\nEven cuddly toys - the classic gift to toddlers - are being sold to adults, helped by social media exposure and their perception of helping people to relax.\n\"There's no shame in it,\" said Kerri Atherton, head of public affairs at the British Toy and Hobby Association. \"It is ok to buy one for yourself.\"\nSimple economics were also at play here, she said. A falling birth rate means there are fewer children for whom to buy toys.\nFamilies have been hit hard by the rising cost of living. The consumer group Which? said that an estimated 2.4 million households missed or defaulted on at least one mortgage, rent, loan, credit card or bill in the month to mid-January.\nBut there is a theory that some young adults are going out less, drinking less and so treating themselves instead with a comforting toy.\nThe toy sector has had a tough year, but second childhoods may just have provided a new seam to exploit.",

    "New planets formed around stars have flattened shapes \"similar to Smarties\", scientists have found.\nResearchers at the University of Central Lancashire (Uclan) in Preston used computer simulations to model the formation of planets.\nIt is the first time scientists have looked at the shape of newborn planets in simulations as they form.\nThey had \"always assumed they were spherical\" and were surprised to find they had a similar shape to the sweets.\nThe team used a concept in astrophysics known as \"the theory of disk instability\" - where planets form in short timescales from the breaking up of large rotating discs of dense gas and dust orbiting young stars.\nDr Dimitris Stamatellos, reader in astrophysics at Uclan, said it showed young planets were oblate spheroids - spheres squashed from the top and the bottom but bulging in the middle.\n\"We have been studying planet formation for a long time but never before had we thought to check the shape of the planets as they form in the simulations,\" he said.\n\"We had always assumed that they were spherical.\n\"We were very surprised that they turned out to be oblate spheroids, pretty similar to Smarties.\"\nHe said technically, no planet was fully spherical.\nJupiter's flattening, for example, was about 6%, while Saturn is 10%, and Earth was almost spherical at just 0.3%, he said.\nHe said young planets were much flatter and somewhere in the region of 90%.\nThe team's study, published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters, was based on investigating the shapes of young planets and how they grow to become gas giants like Jupiter.\nThey said the findings had important implications, particularly when viewing planets through a telescope as their shapes would vary depending on the viewing angle.\nThe researchers added that observational confirmation of the flattened shape of young planets could also help answer a key question about how they form.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "The music industry is still a \"boys' club\" where sexual harassment and abuse are common, MPs warned in a report.\nThe Women and Equalities Committee said musicians have to sit beside sexual abusers at parties and events, due to a \"culture of silence\".\nIt makes a series of recommendations to tackle the problem of misogyny, but also said that a shift in the behaviour of men is needed.\nThe government said the industry must ensure \"a safe working environment\".\nThe report by the Women and Equalities Committee follows an inquiry into misogyny in the music industry, which began in June 2022.\nThe cross-party group of MPs concluded that the issue was \"endemic\" and called for urgent action to tackle it.\nThe inquiry heard evidence from people including the former BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Macmanus, who said there was a \"tidal wave\" of revelations about sexual assault in the music industry waiting to be told.\nThe broadcaster and writer said there was an \"unbelievable\" number of stories that have not yet emerged, and warned the industry was \"rigged against women\".\nSinger and former X Factor contestant Rebecca Ferguson said in her evidence that misogyny in music was just \"the tip of the iceberg\".\nShe said bullying and corruption was allowed to happen, and said she had been told rapes were going unreported.\nThe committee warned that non-reporting of sexual harassment and abuse was high, and that victims who did speak out struggle to be believed or face losing their career.\nThey said female artists are routinely undervalued and undermined, endure a focus on their physical appearance in a way that men are not subjected to, and have to work far harder to get the recognition their ability merits.\n\"Much of the evidence we received has had to remain confidential, including commentary on television shows and household names,\" the report said.\n\"That is highly regrettable but demonstrates the extent of the use of NDAs [non-disclosure agreements] and the culture of silence.\"\nIt said women in the music industry have had \"their lives ruined and their careers destroyed by men who have never faced the consequences for their actions\".\nMore broadly, the MPs also said women face a lack of support and persistent unequal pay, and warned these issues are worse for women who already face racial discrimination.\nIn 2021, a BLiM (Black Lives in Music) report found that racism in the British music industry was \"serious, upfront and personal\".\nMisogyny is 'endemic'\nThe report by the Women and Equalities Committee makes a series of recommendations to try and tackle misogyny and discrimination in the music industry.\nThe MPs called on ministers to amend the Equality Act, to ensure freelance workers have the same protections from discrimination as employees, and to improve protections for people facing intersectional inequality.\nThey also recommended the government legislate to impose a duty on employers to protect workers from sexual harassment by third parties.\nThe committee also urged ministers to prohibit the use of non-disclosure agreements in cases involving sexual abuse, sexual harassment or bullying.\nOther recommendations in the report include increasing investment in diverse talent, and improving pathways to careers for women working in the industry.\nThe report welcomed the establishment of a single, recognisable body, the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority, which it said would help to shine a light on unacceptable behaviour in the music industry.\nBut the committee cautioned it is \"not a panacea for all of the problems in the industry\" and \"time will tell whether it has the powers required to drive the changes needed\".\nThe committee chair, Caroline Nokes, said women's potential \"should not have limits placed upon it by 'endemic' misogyny which has persisted for far too long within the music industry\".\nShe said the report focuses on improving protections and reporting mechanisms, and on making reforms.\n\"However, a shift in the behaviour of men - and it is almost always men - at the heart of the music industry is the transformative change needed for talented women to quite literally have their voices heard and be both recognised and rewarded on equal terms.\"\nA government spokesperson said: \"All women should be able to work in a music sector which is free from misogyny and discrimination. The industry must do all it can to ensure there is a supportive and safe working environment and to address any imbalances of power that exist.\n\"The government will carefully consider the Committee's recommendations, and it is right that the industry is taking action through work led by Creative UK and the formation of the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority.\"\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

Because the link workers are recruited from within the armed forces community they are able to provide the understanding and empathy necessary to help ex-service personnel and their families with a range of complex needs.\"\nCornwall has 30,229 veterans, which at 6.3% is one of the highest proportions in the UK.\n'They get frustrated'\nEx-RAF Cornwall councillor Martyn Alvey said ex-service personnel faced unique challenges.\nHe said: \"Veterans often do not engage well with organisations that are not designed specifically for them and commonly will not access or engage with people who they feel do not understand what they have seen, done, and are currently going through.\n\"They get frustrated at having to tell their story repeatedly and being passed from organisation to organisation. They often ask for a single point of contact who could provide access to the right organisation at the right time in a layered or step by step manner, and this is exactly what the new link workers will be able to offer.\"\nThe social prescribing programme is delivered by Active Plus and overseen by Public Health, Cornwall Council and the NHS Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Integrated Care Board.\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

It really was a fun time,\" said the family in a statement, released via the auction house.\nWhen production finished and Mr Ford moved out of the flat, he left behind a fourth draft script for the film. The movie's original title was The Adventures of Luke Starkiller, which later became Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.\nThe script is incomplete and unbound, with differing-coloured pages indicating revisions - and includes scenes and characters cut from the final edit.\nThe script, written by George Lucas, introduces Mr Ford as the cynical hero Han Solo on page 56.\nA second lot is made up of other items Mr Ford left behind in the flat, such as a letter from his agent, Patricia McQueeney, in which she discussed his contracts and future film prospects.\nThe letter also scolded the actor for not contacting his wife.\nOne of the film's shooting schedules will be put on sale, which includes a handwritten note that appears to refer to a meeting between Mr Ford and the film producer Robert Watts.\nThe collection will be auctioned on 17 February.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "The rate of improvement in the number of people who survive cancer has slowed significantly, a study says.\nA report by Cancer Research UK says the rate of progress was five times faster in the 2000s than in the 2010s.\nIt says lack of sufficient funding for research is largely to blame.\nHowever, the report also finds the likelihood of surviving a decade or more with cancer in the UK is the highest it has ever been, rising from 47.9% in 2010-11 to 49.8% in 2018.\nThis compares to about a quarter (24%) in the early 1970s.\nIt is the first time in a decade that the charity has published figures on overall cancer survival rates in the UK.\nScreening programmes for breast, bowel and cervical cancer are credited with saving more than 5,000 lives a year.\nResearch has also led to improvements in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.\nBut the report estimates that unless government spending levels for research are maintained over the next 10 years, there will be a funding gap of more than \u00c2\u00a31bn, which could \"put further medical advances at risk\".\nJon Shelton, head of cancer intelligence at Cancer Research UK, said: \"This report shows us where the UK is doing well, and where we need to focus on improvements for patients. There are positives in here - screening is having a real impact, and cancer mortality rates are falling.\n\"There are many areas to improve though. Cancer survival is not improving quickly enough. People are waiting far too long for diagnosis and to start treatment, with cancer waiting time targets consistently being missed. And we need to prevent more cancers.\"\nThe report says smoking remains the biggest cause of cancer in the UK, with 150 cases in the UK every day.\nMeanwhile obesity and being overweight causes about 22,800 cases of cancer every year in the UK and is a risk factor for 13 different types of the illness, the report says.\nCancer Research UK says a \"national cancer council\" should be set up for England, bringing together the government, scientists, and charities, to create a 10-year cancer strategy.\nIt says that by 2040 there are projected to be 500,000 new cancer cases diagnosed each year in the UK - mainly because of a growing and ageing population.\nBut about a quarter of cancers in England over the last decade have been diagnosed as an emergency - and cancers first spotted via this route are more likely to have late-stage disease, which affects their treatment options.\nThe analysis for this new report was carried out for Cancer Research UK by the Cancer Survival Group, based at the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nCancer Research UK says for every \u00c2\u00a31 invested in research, \u00c2\u00a32.80 of economic benefits are generated.\nA Department of Health spokesperson said: \"We welcome the news that record numbers of people are surviving cancer long term, with people being diagnosed earlier and the NHS treating record numbers of cancer patients over the past two years.\n\"But we know there is more work to do.\n\"We are working to make access to cancer services faster and simpler. We have also invested \u00c2\u00a32.3bn into speeding up diagnosis and launched 153 community diagnostic centres across England.\"",

    "If you have driven or cycled anywhere in Derbyshire recently, chances are you will have encountered a pothole.\nLast month the county council wrote an open letter to residents apologising for the \"massive increase\" and pledging to tackle the backlog.\nThis week the authority has been answering questions from BBC Radio Derby listeners about the ongoing problem.\nWhy are there so many potholes at the moment?\nDerbyshire County Council said floods, snow, and rainfall recently had led to damage, but the problem was decades in the making with roads getting older.\nThe open letter, published in mid-January, was signed by the authority's director of highways Julian Gould and Charlotte Cupit, cabinet member for highways assets and transport.\nThey wrote: \"Whilst we always prepare for winter, the last few months really have thrown exceptional things at us.\n\"Many communities sadly are still dealing with the destruction of October and Babet's floods (with a month of rain in a single day), November's freeze and snow, and December's double the usual rainfall.\n\"You're right though when you say this recent damage isn't the only problem: this has been decades in the making with aging highways and reducing investment comparatively.\"\nHow many potholes are being filled?\nThe council said its teams were currently repairing about 1,500 potholes a week on the county's roads - with 90,000 filled in 2023.\nIt currently has 25 teams working across the county seven days a week - although it said some of these could be diverted if weather conditions worsen or roads need gritting.\nThe council said since April 2023 it had spent just over \u00c2\u00a34m on pothole repairs and it was \"bumping up resources to deal with the current backlog\".\nHowever the authority said the large size of the county and the number of narrow roads were among the factors that can slow down their efforts.\nIs the council struggling to keep up with the number of potholes being reported?\nMs Cupit said: \"I think it's a challenging period at the moment, we're feeling it, the teams are feeling it and so are the residents.\n\"We are doing everything we can to keep up and keep on top of it.\"\nShe continued: \"We are hopefully going to bump it up even more but we are weather dependent.\n\"We are trying to get on top of it because we know that's what residents want and we want to fix it.\"\nWhy are fixed potholes going wrong again? Are you scrimping on materials?\nDave Ford is a project engineer at the county council.\nHe told the BBC: \"We try to do them right first time, every time. There's instances where we can't because of traffic flows.\n\"We would aim to do a temporary repair and come back to it at some point in the very near future.\"\nMs Cupit added: \"Sometimes we know certain potholes are on the capital programme. When we are about to do a bigger repair on a road it doesn't make sense to spend lots of money on a smaller repair when we know we're coming back.\"\nOn the subject of scrimping, Ms Cupit said: \"We spend a lot of money on materials, we want to use the best materials.\n\"We want to use and utilise new technology. We've got our own laboratory in Derbyshire which is quite unique.\n\"What works on one road, might not work on another road in Derbyshire due to the variety in the county.\"\nMr Ford added: \"We definitely don't scrimp on materials. We are looking at future products and looking at different ways of repairing potholes so hopefully we can tackle more potholes at a cheaper rate.\"\nWhen you are filling in a pothole, why do you often ignore others in the same spot?\nMr Ford said: \"The other potholes around it might not be actionable. We will come back and we will tackle them at some point but only when they get to an actionable state.\n\"If we do have chance, we will repair while we are there.\"\nHe added the decision on whether the pothole is actionable \"depends on where on the road the pothole is and its potential impact on vehicles and other highway users\".\n\"Our inspectors assess all these factors when logging repairs,\" he said.\nThe council said more information on the current pothole situation could be found in its open letter .\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "After months of fierce fighting, small groups of Russian troops have reached the heavily damaged eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka and are trying to gain a foothold there.\nThe small number of civilians left have been fleeing the town in greater numbers under relentless fire, and as Ukrainian forces try to repel the attacks.\nAvdiivka is a gateway to the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. It has been effectively on the front line since 2014 when the conflict in eastern Ukraine started.\nAll attempts by Russian troops to advance there have failed. Until now.\nResidents who have fled and volunteers who try to evacuate others from Avdiivka told the BBC that Russian troops had recently seized several streets in the southern part of the town.\nOne volunteer, who wished to remain anonymous, claimed they were first seen in the outskirts on 19 January.\n\"Some people managed to get out from those areas but it was two days ago,\" he said. \"Now, no-one is coming out. We are only getting information that there are bodies on the streets but it's too dangerous to go there.\"\nAvdiivka had a pre-war population of more than 30,000. Last summer it was closer to 1,650. Now, there are just over 1,000 remaining. Many have fled, but many have also been killed.\nThe head of the town's military administration, Vitaly Barabash, says it was small Russian sabotage groups who managed to get to the outskirts, and not large units.\n\"They didn't enter with serious forces. Yes, they had certain success, but the street that everyone is talking about - Soborna Street - is under our control. We have pushed them out,\" he told the BBC.\nThis is, however, the first time that Russians have managed to enter the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.\nSince last October, the Russians have unleashed a relentless campaign of artillery and air strikes. Authorities say that in January alone, they dropped more than 300 guided aviation bombs.\nAnd as its buildings have been reduced to rubble, Avdiivka has become a graveyard as well as a ghost town.\nThe dead are left under the rubble as there are neither emergency services nor equipment to clear the wreckage.\nVlad Mahovsky, a volunteer who evacuates civilians, showed the BBC a message from a resident a few days ago.\n\"The basement where people were staying on Soborna Street has been hit, a lot of people have died,\" it says.\nThe volunteer was unable to get there because the street is now the new front line.\nGennadiy Yudin and his colleague Dmytro Soloviy are part of the \"White Angels\" police unit that organises evacuations.\nThey are often the first to arrive at the scene of explosions, meaning they are often targeted in follow-up attacks.\nEarlier this month at the site of an air strike, they discovered a woman bleeding badly inside a house.\nShots rang out nearby as they were tending to her wounds. Shortly afterwards, a drone dropped a bomb that narrowly missed their car.\nMany residents avoid staying in basements in large groups now. The Russian drones are able to spot where they gather and drop bombs, says Vitaliy Barabash.\nThey can detect the smoke from stoves too, he adds.\nDespite the bombardments and unbearable living conditions, there is still a contingent of holdouts who do not want to be evacuated.\nMr Yudin said many people were scared of the uncertainty of moving to a new location.\nIn one of the videos the White Angels shared with the BBC, they visit an elderly woman after several rockets fell near her house. They beg her to leave to join her grandchildren, but she refuses.\n\"Let me die here,\" she tells them with a weak voice. She can barely walk.\nThere is a perception among many Ukrainians that those who remain in front-line villages and towns have pro-Russian views. In some cases that may be true, but those staying at this point - when death could come at any moment - are unlikely to be motivated by politics.\nAnd there has been an increase in those leaving as the fighting intensifies - 400 people since October, according to the town's military administration.\nSome leave because they are wounded and require urgent medical care.\n\"My wife is very ill, so I decided to leave,\" says Victor. \"It's unbearable. I need to leave to save her.\"\nVictor is among six people who left with volunteer Vlad Mahovsky. They spoke to the BBC when they made a short stop in Myrnohrad, some 50km (30 miles) away from their hometown.\nThey looked on with interest as people walked along the pavement and cars waited at traffic lights. They hadn't seen such scenes for nearly two years.\nJust half an hour before, as they were leaving Avdiivka, a shell landed near their second car but luckily no-one was hurt.\nEkaterina Vasylyivna, 79, is still shaking from the journey through what is now known as the \"road of life\".\nThree times shells and rockets fell near her house but it was the death of her husband that pushed her to leave. \"He went out to get bread and never came back,\" she said, crying. \"I've been left alone.

It's disgusting,\" Mr Webber's father David added.\nAsked why the government had not set up a public inquiry, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"We haven't ruled out further action at this stage.\n\"The health secretary has ordered a review into the mental health services at the NHS trust where Calocane was treated, the attorney general is also looking at the sentence and will meet with the director of public prosecutions, I believe, to discuss that later today.\n\"The policing minister is meeting senior leaders at Nottinghamshire Police to discuss the circumstances.\"\nThe care of Calocane, 32, at Nottinghamshire Healthcare Foundation NHS Trust will be reviewed by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).\nThe CQC said the rapid review would be completed before the end of March.\nHealth Secretary Victoria Atkins said: \"The CQC is going to report back to me by the end of March on this to see if there are practical measures that should be taken to tighten up these services and to ensure the safety of families and residents across Nottinghamshire.\"\nMr and Mrs Webber said they were due to meet Mr Starmer later, as they pledged to fight to get \"appropriate justice and appropriate answers\".\nMrs Webber added: \"We don't want to be the next Post Office families or Hillsborough families, but I say this to anybody in charge and decision-makers: you have got the full weight of the Webber family, the O'Malley-Kumar family and the Coates family all united behind this.\"\nIt comes as the attorney general is considering whether judges should review Calocane's sentence.\nAnd NHS England has said it is planning to order a separate Independent Mental Health Homicide Review into Calocane's contact with mental health services, which is expected to take many months to complete.\nChris Dzikiti, director of mental health at the CQC, said: \"We will conduct a rapid review into mental health services in Nottingham to understand whether there are any practical actions which can be taken to improve the quality of services and ensure people receive safe and effective care.\n\"We will begin this work immediately, aiming to report to the secretary of state before the end of March.\"\nIfti Majid, chief executive of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"We welcome external inspections as they are important to helping us learn and continually improve our services,  giving us independent insight to highlight areas for development so that the experience for those who use our services is improved.\n\"We look forward to working with the Care Quality Commission and NHS England, and we undertake to swiftly implement any recommendations.\n\"Our thoughts remain with the families and friends of Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates, and those who are affected by the tragic events in Nottingham in June 2023.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "Police in Brazil have raided a number of properties linked to Carlos Bolsonaro, one of the sons of former President Jair Bolsonaro.\nThe search is part of an investigation into allegations that political enemies of President Bolsonaro were spied on illegally by the Brazilian intelligence service during his time in office.\nCarlos Bolsonaro often attacked his father's critics on social media.\nHe has in the past been accused of spreading fake news, which he denies.\nNeither Carlos Bolsonaro nor his father have so far commented on this latest raid.\nThe scandal first broke on Thursday when Brazil's Supreme Court unsealed documents in which the country's intelligence agency Abin was accused of carrying out surveillance on key political and judicial figures critical of the former president.\nAmong the alleged targets of the illegal eavesdropping were three Supreme Court justices and a speaker of Brazil's lower house of Congress.\nPolice searched the home and offices of Alexandre Ramagem - the former head of Abin and a close ally of Jair Bolsonaro - on Thursday.\nBut the investigation moved much closer to the former president on Monday when officers arrived at a beach house where Jair Bolsonaro was staying with his sons.\nThe former leader was reportedly on a fishing trip with his sons when police arrived at the property in Angra dos Reis.\nThis latest probe adds to the legal problems of Jair Bolsonaro, who has been banned from running for office for eight years after casting unfounded doubts on Brazil's electronic voting system.\nNow police are investigating whether Abin may have been illegally used during Mr Bolsonaro's presidency to collect information on people who were perceived to be critical of the president.\nDuring his father's presidency, Carlos Bolsonaro often acted as an unofficial spokesman for the elder Bolsonaro, attacking foes of the president on social media.\nA police source told Reuters news agency they suspected that Carlos Bolsonaro had illegally used information gathered by Abin.\nPolice said last week that their investigations indicated that a \"criminal group\" had created \"a parallel structure within the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (Abin) and used its tools and services for illicit acts, producing information for political and media purposes, for personal gain and to interfere in federal police investigations\".\nUnder Jair Bolsonaro's presidency Brazil became increasingly polarised with followers and opponents of the president accusing each other of dirty tactics.\nSince he narrowly lost to Luiz In\u00c3\u00a1cio Lula da Silva in the 2022 election, the former president has come under investigation for a number of alleged wrongdoings, including corruption and abuse of power.",

He travelled on Thursday from Sandringham to London to have the operation.\nAn enlarged prostate is a benign problem - which is non-cancerous - and common in older men, according to the NHS, with about one in three men over the age of 50 having some symptoms.\nThe medical treatment is not significant enough to require any constitutional changes for the King's role as head of state. There will not be a need for \"counsellors of state\" who can stand in when a monarch is seriously ill.\nThe Palace said the reason the King made his diagnosis public was to send a message to other men to get their prostates checked, and following the disclosure, the NHS website saw a surge in searches about enlarged prostates , an interest welcomed by doctors and charities.\nA Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King was \"delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness,\" and added that he wanted to \"thank all those who have sent their good wishes\".\nQueen Camilla accompanied him to the hospital in Marylebone, central London, on Friday.\nBefore leaving she told people inside the hospital that her husband was \"doing well, thank you\".\nThe Queen returned later on Friday evening for a visit that lasted around 90 minutes.",
    "Demonstrations are taking place across major cities in Kenya to protest against the rising cases of femicide and other violence against women.\nHundreds have gathered in Nairobi, Nakuru, Mombasa, Nyeri and Lodwar, some carrying placards with the names of those who were killed.\nA 2022 survey found at least one in three Kenyan women had endured physical violence at some point in their lives.\n\"I am here because I'm angry,\" 33-year-old Winnie Chelagat told the BBC.\n\"It is wrong, we are tired and we want something to be done about it.\"\nMen and boys must take responsibility for their own actions instead of the burden being on women and girls to protect themselves, said another protester called Michael Onyango.\n\"We should educate our sons and tell them that they need to stop killing women.\"\nSaturday's protests follow a series of gruesome murders of women - including one victim, later named as Rita Waeni, whose dismembered remains were found stuffed into a plastic bag at a short-term rental apartment .\nThe killings have been widely referred to as the Airbnb murders in Kenya but Airbnb told the BBC it had investigated and the women had not booked accommodation through its site.\nFemicide is defined as intentionally killing a woman or girl because they are female.\nAmnesty International says more than 500 cases of femicide were recorded in Kenya between the years 2016 and 2023.\nMany of the victims were killed by intimate partners or people known to them.\nCampaigners want the authorities to expedite justice for all recent victims of sexual and gender-based violence.\nDozens of local rights groups say the government must declare femicide a national emergency and class femicide as a specific crime, distinct from murder.\nIn Nairobi on Saturday, demonstrators chanted \"Sisi ni watu sio wanyama\" in Swahili - meaning \"we are human beings not animals\".\nOthers carried banners saying \"only weak men kill women\" and \"every time you blame the victim you affirm the murderer\".\nVictim-blaming has been rife on social media, with commenters in Kenya's so-called \"manosphere\" blaming murdered women for their own deaths.\nMany messages on online platforms focus on what the victims were wearing when they were attacked, or question why they did not use their mobile phones to tell family and friends their whereabouts.\nDespite Kenya having robust laws against gender-based violence, most perpetrators go unpunished.

    "An off-piste skier hoping to carve on every peak in Wales has bagged one of the country's rarest slopes.\nChris Morris, 30, a property manager from Reynalton, Pembrokeshire, said the snow seldom lasted long on the nearby Preseli Hills.\nBut the conditions were just right on 19 January when Foel Eryr was blanketed in the white stuff.\n\"I got up there and took advantage before it was all washed away,\" he said.\n\"The Preselis are my local hills,\" he explained.\n\"I've always lived in Pembrokeshire and have looked up there and seen some snow and just really wanted to get up there and ski.\"\nBeing near the Welsh coast and having a highest peak of just 536m (1759ft), they \"don't get as much snow as some of the other hills in Wales\", Chris said.\n\"I was watching the evening news and Derek [Brockway] the weatherman said there'd be some snow up in Pembrokeshire,\" he remembered.\n\"So I just sort of went up there [the following morning] and had a look, as you never really know if there's going to be much snow.\"\nIt was still dark when he arrived at Foel Eryr, a peak above the small village of Rosebush, but the rising sun soon revealed perfect conditions.\n\"That was the first time that I had any decent skiing up there,\" he said.\n\"Normally, either there isn't enough snow or the snow comes down and it just gets blown away, so it was nice to earn a few turns.\"\n\"You could see Cardigan Bay, the mountains in Ireland, Snowdonia (Eryri) in the north, some stunning landscapes for skiing,\" he added.\nCan you ski in Wales?\nChris is part of a little-known group of skiing enthusiasts who eschew the Alps for Welsh mountains.\nThere are no ski resorts, so it is strictly an off-piste endeavour and not, according to Chris, for the \"faint-hearted\".\n\"If you have the right kit... a lightweight pair of skis and comfortable, flexible boots, it's a lot easier,\" he said.\n\"But still not as easy as going up on a lift.\"\nHe started to learn \"conventionally\" from 13, first at Pembrey in Carmarthenshire, one of the six artificial ski slopes in Wales , and then at ski resorts abroad.\n\"I've been skiing in to France, Austria, Italy, the Balkans, and I've done a bit up in Scotland.\"\nIn 2018 he watched a video of Mike Richards, a ski instructor from Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire, skiing in Bannau Brycheiniog National Park, also known as the Brecon Beacons.\n\"That just sort of opened my eyes to what's possible in Wales when conditions allow,\" he said, explaining how the following winter he and Mike met up to ski on Pen y Fan - the tallest mountain in the national park.\nHe has been hooked ever since, sometimes even heading to the slopes when there is no snow.\n\"Then you kind of know the lay of the land and where the hazards are,\" he said. \"When the snow comes, you can avoid most of them.\"\nNext on his bucket list is Wales' tallest mountain, Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon.\n\"Snowdon's quite rocky so you need a really good covering of snow,\" he said.\n\"But some of the mountains nearby have some grassy areas that don't take an awful lot of snow to get into condition.\"\nHe skied Moel Eiliol, above Llanberis, calling it \"good fun in the sunshine\".\nSo what is the alpine skiing scene in Wales like?\n\"It's been going on sporadically for a long time, so some people kind of know it exists,\" he said.\n\"But a lot of people are surprised about what we have here in Wales.\n\"I think the mountains are absolutely perfect, if you can get them in good condition with a good covering of snow, then it's absolutely superb.\"\nSkiing has had its brief moments in Wales.\nIn the 1980s, on a slope near Merthyr Tydfil, snow-making machines were used to create a groomed trail at the Merthyr Ski Slope centre.\nBut making snow and keeping it on the slope proved too difficult and the centre closed.\nBritain's most famous ski jumper, Eddie \"the Eagle\" Edwards visited Merthyr in 1988 for the opening of a new artificial slope at the same site in Pentrebach.\nThat closed as well, but plans were submitted last year by Marvel Limited to build the UK's longest indoor ski slope as part of Rhydycar West, a \u00c2\u00a3300m leisure resort on a 575-acre site overlooking Merthyr Tydfil.\nChris said he was focussed on what is already on offer in the Welsh \"back-country\".\n\"The mountains are stunning,\" he said.\n\"It's just a shame that the snow it's very transient... it never really stays for any sort of length of time unfortunately.\"",

    "Kosovo's authorities are pressing ahead with a policy that makes the euro the only acceptable currency, even though some areas still use Serbian dinars.\nThe move has caused concern amongst Kosovo's international partners.\nThe EU, US and UK are worried it may increase tensions in majority-Serb municipalities.\nAfter coming under pressure, Kosovo's government said it would \"not implement punitive measures immediately\" if people continued to use the dinar.\nBut that is not likely to reassure Kosovo Serbs, who have seen a succession of symbols of their identity erased in recent months.\nSerbian number plates disappeared at the start of the year, and Kosovo authorities have been removing Serbian flags and signs from public buildings in majority-Serb areas.\nKosovo basics\nThe potential impact of the currency policy is obvious in places such as North Mitrovica. The town may be within the borders of the Republic of Kosovo but enter a shop, cafe or restaurant on the north bank of the River Ibar and you will quickly find that prices are set in Serbian dinars.\nThe dinar's usage reflects the fact that most of the population in Kosovo's four northern municipalities are Serbs. They do not recognise Kosovo's 2008 unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia, and many work in institutions which are still funded by the government in Belgrade.\nThat means their salaries are paid in dinars. The same applies to pensions and social benefits paid to Serbs living in Kosovo, who are in a majority in a total of 10 municipalities.\nThey have had little notice of the authorities' plan to ban the use of the dinar. The central bank only made the announcement midway through January, leaving no time to adapt.\nThe EU says it is \"concerned about the consequences that this decision might have on the daily lives of Kosovo Serbs\".\nIt also criticised the \"absence of prior consultation\" and warns that the euro-only policy could have an \"impact on schools and hospitals, given the apparent absence of alternatives at this moment\". The US and the UK have voiced similar concerns.\nBut government in Pristina has shown little inclination to listen to Kosovo's biggest supporters.\nIn fact, Deputy Prime Minister Besnik Bislimi argues that the new regulations do not amount to a ban on the currency as it was \"not allowed in Kosovo even before\". Instead, the policy aims to \"protect consumers and the payment system in Kosovo\", he says.\nThat argument will not convince Kosovo Serbs or many international observers. The International Crisis Group think tank says the currency ban fits in to a pattern of \"sustained pressure\" on Kosovo Serbs since Prime Minister Albin Kurti took power in 2021.\nIt cites \"harsh security measures\" as well as an embargo on Serbian goods and the eviction of Serbian institutions from northern municipalities.\nIt estimates that one in 10 Serbs have left Kosovo just in the past year as a result, with as many as a third leaving for good since 2016.\nThe think tank calls on the EU to encourage Mr Kurti to soften his stance. But with normalisation talks between Belgrade and Pristina completely stalled, Brussels is struggling to assert its influence.\nFor now, despite the ban, people in North Mitrovica are still using dinars and can even withdraw them from Postal Savings Bank cash machines. But for Kosovo Serbs, the currency situation adds to a growing feeling of precariousness.",
    "A New York jury has said Donald Trump must pay $83.3m (\u00c2\u00a365.6m) to E Jean Carroll, a writer he was found to have defamed by denying her allegation of sexual assault. Legal experts say the award is a message to the former president to stop smearing her. But will it work?\nLast year Ms Carroll won another civil case in which a separate jury found Mr Trump legally responsible for sexually abusing and defaming her, and awarded her $5m in damages.\nThe outcome in the first case did nothing to deter the former president in denying Ms Carroll's story, personally attacking the writer and claiming he had never met her.\nBut after Friday's hefty legal bill, he notably did not denigrate the former Elle columnist in his reaction online, instead calling the case a \"Biden Directed Witch Hunt\".\nMr Trump - who is currently facing four criminal indictments and could soon have to dish out millions more dollars in a New York civil trial relating to business fraud - has often claimed the cases against him are politically motivated.\nIn terms of his election campaign, his mounting legal woes have been both a boon and a bane for him, said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University.\n\"It's hurt the general population's views of him, but it's fuelled and strengthened his base, and even driven some Republicans on the fence to 'stay loyal' to the cause,\" Prof Reeher told the BBC.\n\"Trump has been trying to wear these legal troubles as a badge of honour for his victimisation, and of his commitment to his supporters.\"\nBut he added that, while Mr Trump's \"witch hunt\" framing may benefit him in the ongoing Republican primary contest, how it translates to the general election remains to be seen.\nRecent polling has shown Mr Trump locked in a tight race with President Joe Biden, and even edging ahead in some cases, in a prospective rematch of their 2020 race.\nThat \"says as much about Biden and the Democrats as it does about Trump\", said Prof Reeher, alluding to the president's weak job approval ratings and concerns about his age.\nEven if Mr Trump does genuinely believe he has been wronged by Ms Carroll, and most of his supporters agree, Friday's verdict reflects how nine of his peers, sitting in the jury box, felt about his conduct.\nLawyers for Ms Carroll pointed out throughout the trial that Mr Trump was still defaming her both in and out of court.\nIn closing arguments, they asked the jurors - seven men and two women - to deliver the kind of penalty that will \"make him stop\".\n\"This is a large sum. This is a very, very large sum,\" said Dmitriy Shakhnevich, an attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\"What the jury is saying is this is a wealthy man who's not stopping, and the only way to stop him is to hurt him [financially].\"\nOf the $83m awarded to Ms Carroll, $65m of it is punitive damages. An award for punitive damages \"relies on severity of the conduct\", Prof Shakhnevich noted.\nConservative lawyer John Yoo told Fox News: \"The whole point of this... is to tell Donald Trump to shut up.\n\"I can't believe his lawyers haven't succeeded in telling him: campaign for president, make your accusations about a two-tiered justice system, but leave this alone.\"\nAnd, though the ex-president is signalling his intention to appeal, legal experts told the BBC he is unlikely to win.\nThe sum of punitive damages \"is not so disproportionate to the compensatory damages that it will raise any red flags, and so I would expect that it will stick\", RonNell Andersen Jones, a professor at the University of Utah said.\nProf Jones said Mr Trump's online reaction - taking aim at Mr Biden and the legal system, but not reiterating lies about Ms Carroll - may be an early clue that the damages could have some deterrent effect.\nUniversity of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said the Republican's \"misbehaviour throughout the trial\" may have hurt his case.\nProf Tobias argued there was a distinct \"lack of respect which Trump exhibited for the judge, the jurors, the opposing counsel, especially Carroll and the civil trial process\".\nIt is extremely unlikely that the Supreme Court would grant an appeal, he added, because the justices rarely ever review cases involving such civil trials.\nFormer federal prosecutor Mitch Epner said Mr Trump has avoided having to pay Ms Carroll any money so far by transmitting a deposit to the court while the appeals process plays out.\nMr Epner expects Mr Trump will do the same with these much higher damages - stumping up either cash or an appeal bond as a deposit.\nWithout that, he added, Ms Carroll could start seizing the former president's personal assets around the country, even putting liens on his real estate.\nBut after Mr Trump's commanding victories in the first two Republican primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, there is no sign that Friday's verdict will slow his march to the party's presidential nomination.\n\"The first test will be South Carolina,\" said Brian Crowley, a long-time politica",

    "A federal judge in Brazil has ordered mining giants BHP, Vale and their Samarco iron ore joint venture to pay 47.6bn reais ($9.67bn) in damages over a deadly dam burst in 2015.\nThe collapse of the Fund\u00c3\u00a3o dam in the south-east of the country caused a giant mudslide that killed 19 people.\nIt also severely polluted the Rio Doce river, compromising the waterway to its outlet in the Atlantic Ocean.\nIt was not immediately clear how much each company is required to pay.\nJudge Vinicius Cobucci said the companies were liable for \"moral damages\", or non-material harm, such as emotional distress suffered by those affected by the incident.\nHe added that the money, which will be adjusted for inflation since 2015, will be put into a state fund and used for projects and initiatives in the area impacted by the dam collapse.\nThe ruling came in response to a civil action brought by state and federal public prosecutors.\nVale told the BBC that it had not yet been informed about the ruling.\nThe company also said that as of December last year, the Renova Foundation, which the firms have been using to make compensation payments, has so far paid out 34.7bn reais.\nBHP did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the BBC. Samarco declined to comment.\nThe ruling allows for the companies to appeal the decision.\nSamarco is a 50-50 joint venture between Australian mining group BHP and Brazil's Vale.\nThe disaster in Minas Gerais state, which also displaced 700 people, is considered to be one of the country's worst environmental disasters.\nWhen the dam burst, it unleashed a deluge of thick, red toxic mud that wiped out the village of Bento Rodrigues.\nIt also polluted the Rio Doce river and Atlantic Ocean 650km away, devastating wildlife and tainting drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people.\nA report released in 2016 found that the collapse of the dam was due to design flaws.\nThe technical report, commissioned by Samarco's joint owners BHP and Vale, did not assign blame for the disaster.\nDams holding mining waste, known as \"tailings\", commonly have walls made of a mixture of sand-like particles and clay-like silt.\nThe report said that a change in the Fund\u00c3\u00a3o dam's design between 2011 and 2012 led to less efficient water drainage, and ultimately to the dam's collapse on 5 November 2015.\nSand in the dam walls became saturated, and abruptly started to behave more like a liquid, in a process known as \"liquefaction\".\nA small earthquake on the day of the dam burst may also have \"accelerated\" the failure, the report added.\nThe disaster triggered intense scrutiny of safety policies in the mining industry.\nBHP and Vale also face a class action lawsuit in the UK with more than 700,000 claimants.\nIn January 2019, another tailings dam owned by Vale collapsed in the same state near the town of Brumadinho, resulting in 270 deaths.\u00c2",

    "It is now less than a year before a UK general election must be held.\nUse our interactive poll tracker to check the latest trends measuring how people say they intend to vote.\nIf you can't see the chart, click here .\nWhat do polls tell us so far?\nThe last possible date a general election can be held is 28 January 2025, writes BBC senior political analyst Peter Barnes.\nRishi Sunak, who as prime minister can call it, has said his \"working assumption\" is the general election will take place in the second half of this year.\nUnfortunately for him, opinion polls currently suggest he will be out of office after the country has voted.\nThat is not inevitable. Labour is in a commanding position at the moment, but their lead could narrow between now and polling day.\nIn fact, the historical record indicates this is likely. In previous elections where the main opposition party was ahead in the polls a year out, the governing party has always managed to close the gap or even reverse it.\nThe trouble for Mr Sunak is that no government has been this far behind and gone on to win.\nFor the Conservatives to win from here, based on polling evidence, it is going to take an unprecedented turnaround in fortunes.\nHow big are the gaps between parties?\nAll polls are based on a sample of people interviewed, typically more than 1,000, which is then weighted to be representative of the country.\nThere is always a margin of error, meaning the real percentage could be higher or lower than any one poll suggests.\nWe estimate that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown here.\nIndividual poll data is published online by the different companies.\nWhere a party has polled less than 0.5%, it is shown in the table below as 0 due to rounding down the numbers.\nWhat is a poll tracker?\nEach dot in the chart shows one poll result for a party.\nWe summarise all that information with an average line that makes it easier to understand the trend.\nWhich polls do we use?\nTo get an appropriate range of polls for our averages, we use those conducted by members of the British Polling Council.\nIts members agree to the same rules on transparency, but the council has said membership should not be seen as a guarantee of quality.\nThe polls we include have come from BMG, Deltapoll, Find Out Now, focaldata, Ipsos, JL Partners, More in Common, Opinium, Panelbase, People Polling, Redfield and Wilton Strategies, Survation, Techne, Verian (formerly Kantar Public), WeThink (formerly Omnisis), and YouGov.\nWe only include the headline percentages on voting intention, which pollsters calculate by excluding those people who answered \"don't know\" or \"won't vote\".\nMost of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK. People surveyed do not get the option to choose parties which only stand in Northern Ireland.\nWe include data that is in the public domain.

It is common for polling companies to do their work for news organisations, television programmes and campaign groups.\nWhat is the margin of error?\nThe true position for the Conservatives and Labour might be within five percentage points of our average.\nNine out of 10 polls just before election day have been within that range of the eventual national vote shares in the 2010 to 2019 general elections.\nThe gap has been smaller for other parties which campaign throughout Great Britain and smaller still for the SNP and Plaid Cymru.\nHow do we average the polls?\nOur estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls.\nA party's share on any given day is the average of their results from polls taken over the previous fortnight. We only take the most recent poll from each company for that day's averages.\nWhy do polling companies have different results?\nAll opinion polls will differ a bit because they are interviewing different people. There are also other things that can lead to differences between polling companies. For example:\nWhat do pollsters ask?\nFor voting intention, polling companies typically ask interviewees a question along the lines of: \"If a general election were held tomorrow, which party would you vote for?\"\nSome polling companies have not given their interviewees the choice of some parties, including them within the \"other\" category.\nFor example, Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party until 2021, has only been included as an option in every poll featured in our tracker since autumn 2022, while support for Plaid Cymru is included among \"other\" parties in polls released by Techne.\nProduced by Grace Richardson, Scott Jarvis, Becky Rush, Allison Shultes, Libby Rogers, Daniel Wainwright, Aidan McNamee, Jana Tauschinski, Debie Loizou, Preeti Vaghela, Robert Cuffe, John Walton.",

    "A 63-year-old suffering from sepsis could not dial 999 from her house because of the lack of mobile signal.\nCarol Collins, from Eastcote, Northamptonshire, started feeling sick following major surgery in October.\nHer daughter tried calling 999 off three different phones but the line kept breaking up and she had to travel to another village to call.\nO2, the main provider in the area, and Vodafone apologised, citing a fault with a mast.\nMs Collins said it was a \"really, really frightening\" experience and she has now had a landline fitted.\nShe said: \"My daughter had to get into her car and drive to the next village.\n\"When she was asked [by the operator] whether she was with the patient, she said, 'no, she's about a mile-and-a-half away because we can't get signal'.\"\nAn ambulance was eventually sent and after being readmitted to hospital, Ms Collins was diagnosed with sepsis.\n\"It's obviously a life-threatening condition. If I had had a heart attack or something, I wouldn't have been here because of the poor signal.\"\nMs Collins also said the lack of signal meant the hospital could not reach her to arrange further treatment and her chemotherapy started late, which \"could hinder whether it works or not\".\nThe lack of signal had caused issues for other residents in Eastcote, north of Towcester, and surrounding villages since October, but last week the service was eventually restored.\nChris Rogers, a resident of neighbouring Pattishall, said: \"It's a bit like not having water - it's a bit of a shock when you realise how much you rely on it.\n\"When people ask for your mobile number, you have to tell them there's no point as it doesn't work.

    "A cancer patient has hit out at a hospital after he was given potentially harmful medication and left lying in his own urine for hours.\nTerry Downs, 55, from Mitcham in south-west London, says he had a \"horrible experience\" while an inpatient at St George's Hospital in Tooting.\nHe and his wife say they are speaking out in the hope the same thing does not happen to anyone else.\nSt George's NHS Foundation Trust says it is \"very sorry\" about what happened.\nMr Downs, who has been given three months to live, was receiving treatment for a number of health conditions including five cancerous brain tumours, lung and skin cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and vascular disease.\nThe charity store manager has been admitted to the hospital's Trevor Howell cancer treatment unit twice in the past six months.\nBed 'not that wet'\nOn the first visit in September, when he was treated for a perforated bowel, his wife Tracy Downs said her husband was \"very weak and quite ill - he could not move around that much as he was in a lot of pain\".\n\"On one occasion, Terry had wet the bed one night,\" she said. \"He told one of the nurses on duty, but... she said it was not that wet and laid him back down in the bed until I arrived to see him, which was six hours later.\"\n\"On another occasion, a nurse wanted to do Terry's observations and he had to move so she could get to him. He said, 'yes but I am a bit weak' and she replied 'I am waiting',\" Mrs Downs added.\n'Like a death ward'\nMr Downs described the ward as being like a prison, adding: \"I feel it's a case of 'he's not got long, so he doesn't matter'.\n\"Some nurses are so nice but it's the odd few.\"\nHe continued: \"To make you feel worse while you're here is awful.

I deserve better.\"\nHe says he feels that in the future \"if I do suffer in pain there is no way I can risk attending St George's\".\nThe couple have complained to the local Patient Advice and Liaison Service and to the ward manager, who they say is writing up an incident report.\nMr Downs told the BBC that several members of staff were removed from his care team following what happened and he had since been discharged with a palliative care plan.\n\"They said [one] nurse was 'old school', whatever that means, but the first time this happened it was all brushed under the carpet,\" Mr Downs said.\nHe added he has now set up a Go Fund Me to help pay for his funeral costs, \"which is something i would never dream of at the age of 55\".\nA spokesperson for St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We're very sorry to hear about Mr Downs' expressed concerns, which do not reflect the high standard of care we strive to give or the feedback we receive from other patients on this ward.\n\"No formal complaint was received at the time and no members of staff were removed from Mr Downs' care team.\n\"Patient comfort is regularly monitored by our compassionate staff who do their very best to care for people with cancer and their families, however we take these concerns very seriously and have offered to meet him to hear his concerns and learn where we can improve.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "A bloody footprint and hair stuck to a ring were used to identify a man accused of killing a woman almost 30 years ago, a court has been told.\nMarina Koppel, 39, was found dead by her husband David in August 1994, after being stabbed more than 140 times in a flat in Marylebone, central London.\nSandip Patel, 51, was charged with Mrs Koppel's murder - which he denies - after his footprint matched one left at the scene, the Old Bailey was told.\nHe became a confirmed suspect in 2022.\nThe jury heard that his DNA was eventually found to be a match to a hair found by a scientist in 2008 on a ring that had been on Mrs Koppel's finger.\nProsecution barrister William Emlyn Jones KC told court: \"Marina Koppel was brutally murdered.\n\"It has taken a terribly long time to solve it, but we now have evidence that she had this defendant's hair stuck to the ring she was wearing when she was attacked and killed; and his bare foot was pressed against the skirting board next to her.\n\"And that, the prosecution say, can only be because it was him who killed her all those years ago.\"\n'Blood everywhere'\nMrs Koppel, who had two children in her native Colombia, rented the flat in London because she worked as a masseuse and a sex worker, the court heard.\nHer husband, who lived in Northampton, \"did not necessarily approve\" of her work but \"accepted it\", jurors were told.\nMr Koppel drove to the capital because his wife was not answering her telephone, finding her body shortly before 23:30 on the floor of a bedroom where she took clients.\nJurors heard there was blood \"everywhere\".\nAn unmarked plastic carrier bag found by police in Mrs Koppel's kitchen had fingerprints belonging to Mr Patel, then a 21-year-old student, whose father ran a nearby shop, the court was told.\nHowever, officers believed the evidence was not strong enough, as Mr Patel's prints could have been on the plastic bag because he had handled it in his father's shop, and it was possibly brought into the flat by Mrs Koppel.\n'They are the defendant's prints'\nDespite the discovery of the hair during a review of the unsolved case in 2008, technology was not advanced enough for scientists to get a DNA profile, so it was bagged and preserved until 2022, when it was looked at again.\nThe bloody footprint was found at the scene in 1994 and matched to Mr Patel after he was made a suspect in 2022, the court heard.\nMr Emlyn Jones went on: \"You may have little trouble concluding that if those footprints were made in Marina's wet blood, then that can only be because they were left by her killer - someone who was in that room, barefoot, at the time of her blood being on the skirting board.\n\"All these years later, they have been identified - they are the defendant's prints - they were made by the sole of his left foot.\"\nMr Koppel died in 2005, never having discovered who murdered his wife.\nThe trial continues.",
    "Brianna Ghey's mother Esther heard harrowing evidence about her daughter's final moments and the plot to kill her while an 18-day murder trial took place. Although she still feels compassion for the families of the two 16-year-olds responsible, she says killers Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe have shown no remorse.\n\"I could see the way that they were both behaving,\" Esther tells BBC News. \"I could tell that there was no remorse or regret for what they've done.\"\nEsther watched as the pair denied murder and then blamed each other.\nShe listened as prosecutors read out hundreds of WhatsApp messages between them, in which they discussed in cold-blooded detail how they planned to murder her daughter and other children after devising a \"kill list\".\nSixteen-year-old Brianna, who was transgender, was stabbed 28 times after being lured to Culcheth Linear Park in Warrington, Cheshire, by Jenkinson on the afternoon of 11 February 2023.\nThe trial had heard the two defendants were intelligent and \"high-functioning\" but harboured a secret \"thirst for killing\".\nThe pair, who were 15 at the time, had planned the murder for weeks.\n\"Beforehand, I felt like maybe there would be some form of rehabilitation,\" says Esther.\n\"Maybe it was something that had just gone too far - or some mindless killing. But clearly it was calculated.\n\"I completely lost any sympathy that I had for them.\"\nEsther says one of the hardest moments was learning that one of the killers was someone Brianna had considered a friend.\nWhile Esther had never met Jenkinson, she said Brianna had talked about her, telling her mum the two of them had sometimes hung out after school, going to McDonalds together, like any other teenage friends.\nThey had started chatting while taking lessons together in the inclusion room at Birchwood High School, a supervised area with computers for study away from other classrooms.\nBrianna had her lessons in there because of her mental health - her anxiety meant she did not like to be in a busy classroom.\nJenkinson joined in November 2022 on a managed transfer from nearby Culcheth High School.\nBirchwood Community High School head teacher Emma Mills says: \"We were approached by her school in the October time, due to the fact that she had brought cannabis edibles into school.\n\"It was brought to us to look at - would we give her a chance on a managed transfer due to there having been no other issues with her during her time at school?\"\nJenkinson was ultimately only at Birchwood for about 10 weeks. The school was looking at ending the transfer because her attendance had started to drop.\nDuring her time there, Ms Mills says there had not been any \"red flags\" and nothing that indicated her relationship with Brianna was anything out of the ordinary.\n\"I met her several times, and I'd had meetings with her and her mum before she came here,\" she says.\n\"She was quiet, she was polite. There was nothing that indicated that this was going to happen.\"\nBut a File on 4 investigation found that four months before Brianna's killing, Jenkinson had given one of the cannabis sweets to a younger pupil without telling her what it was.\nThe 13-year-old fell ill after eating it.\nWarrington Borough Council said a review was under way.\nJenkinson and Ratcliffe were told they would be detained for at least 22 and 20 years respectively.\nThe sentencing judge, Mrs Justice Yip, said both \"took part in a brutal and planned murder which was sadistic in nature\".\nAddressing Jenkinson, the judge said her \"primary motivation\" was a desire to kill, calling the murder \"exceptionally brutal\".\nThe judge said Jenkinson \"enjoyed the killing\", adding that it was \"a murder involving sadistic conduct\".\nTo Ratcliffe, she said: \"You know what Scarlett wanted to do\" and why.\n\"I find that you were motivated in part by your distaste at Brianna's status as transgender\".\nA documentary - Killed in a Park by BBC North West Tonight - will be released later on BBC iPlayer.\nFile on 4 also tells the story behind the brutal killing of the 16-year-old on BBC Sounds.\nSitting in court during their trial, even seasoned reporters were often taken aback by the level of premeditation, and the cold and dispassionate nature with which they plotted Brianna's murder.\nAlongside the WhatsApp messages where the two talked in graphic detail about murder and torture methods, the jury members were shown a handwritten note recovered by police from Jenkinson's bedroom.\nOn it was written the exact plan that she and Ratcliffe eventually put into place to kill Brianna.\nBrianna had never seen Ratcliffe before the day she was murdered.\nBut when he turned up with Jenkinson to meet her at a bus stop, she thought the three of them were going to hang out together in Culcheth Linear Park.\nJenkinson was, in fact, luring her to her death.\n\"At the time, it felt like it was the worst possible scenario that could have happened,\" says Esther.\n\"It was the worst possible person that could have done it to her, because it was so",
    "Talk of wider war in Europe and the potential need for mass mobilisation or a \"citizen army\" may sound alarming. But the head of the British Army Gen Sir Patrick Sanders is not alone in issuing a national call to prepare for a major conflict on European soil.\nLast week, another senior Nato military chief said countries needed to be on alert \"and expect the unexpected\". Adm Rob Bauer, who heads the alliance's military committee, said the public needed to change their mindset for an era \"when anything can happen at any time\".\nThe UK's defence secretary has also warned that we need to be prepared for a war. In his first major speech on defence, Grant Shapps said the country was moving from a \"post war to a pre-war world\".\nHe highlighted numerous threats, but there is one common thread amid all these warnings - Russia.\nGermany's Defence Minister, Boris Pistorius, recently told a German newspaper \"we have to take into account that Vladimir Putin might even attack a Nato country one day\". While he said such an attack is unlikely now, \"our experts expect a period of five to eight years in which this could be possible\".\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has focussed the West's military minds.\nAs Gen Sir Patrick Sanders stated several times in his speech on Wednesday , \"Ukraine really matters\". Russia's ambitions, he said, were not just about seizing territory but \"about defeating our system and way of life politically, psychologically and symbolically\".\nHow are other countries preparing?\nThere is a sense in the upper echelons of the British military that many politicians and most of the public have not grasped the threat they see. It is the duty of the military to analyse that threat, and they still might be proved wrong. But European nations closer to Russian borders appear to be taking it more seriously.\nGen Sanders specifically mentioned Sweden. Earlier this month, its civil defence minister told a defence conference \"there could be a war in Sweden\". Carl-Oskar Bohlin asked the public \"have you considered whether you have time to join a voluntary defence organisation? If not - get moving!\" His remarks were backed up by the country's top military commander, who said Sweden should prepare itself mentally.\nSome in the country criticised the remarks as alarmist. But others have responded by \"prepping for war\" - stocking food and fuel.\nA number of European countries also rehearse for civil emergencies - with exercises that involve ordinary citizens as well as the military. It is often called total defence.\nJailed for refusing conscription\nA number of northern European countries, including Sweden, already have a form of conscription for their armed forces.\nConscription requires young men and women to serve for a limited time in uniform. It means that some of the population will have had some military training  - and can then be assigned to reserve units should war break out.\nIn Sweden and Norway, conscription is partial - not everyone gets drafted. But it boosts the strength of the professional armed forces, which is often relatively small.\nFinland, Nato's newest member and a country which has an 800-mile border with Russia, has wider conscription. Around 80% of the male population complete some form of military service. Refusal can mean a jail sentence, though there is the option of civilian service out of uniform too.\nThe overall effect means Finland can muster one of Europe's largest armies. The size of its active armed forces is only 19,000 personnel, but it can call on another 238,000 reserves.\nIs UK conscription for a citizen army a realistic plan?\nIn the UK, National Service - the country's old name for conscription- ended in 1960. There are no plans to bring it back.\nGen Sanders was not calling for conscription in his speech. He is a strong believer in a professional army made up of volunteers. But he was making the point that if war broke out troop numbers would be too small.\nCuts have already seen the size of the British Army fall from more than 100,000 in 2010 to around 73,000 now. Gen Sanders said that within the next three years the British Army needed to be 120,000 strong with the addition of reserves. But he said even that is not enough - so the Army should be designed to expand rapidly \"to enable the first echelon, resource the second echelon, and train and equip the citizen army that must follow\".\nHe added that: \"Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.\"\nSo, what did he mean by a citizen army? He was not making a case for conscription or for an imminent call up of volunteers. Instead, he was urging Britain to prepare for a mass mobilisation of tens of thousands of people, should war break out. That would require planning and a change of mindset in government.\nDowning Street does not seem keen - it said the general's hypothetical scenarios were not helpful.\nYet the Army is already looking at how it might create a citizens' army. One Whitehall source told the Time",
    "A senior care assistant has been jailed for nine months for ill-treating patients at a nursing home in Londonderry.\nShaun Lynch, 54, of Ballybegley, Newtowncunningham in County Donegal, was sentenced at Londonderry Crown Court on Thursday.\nHe admitted seven charges of ill-treating six patients between September 2019 and December 2020.\nJudge Neil Rafferty said he had been \"highly aggressive\" on some occasions.\nBut the judge said Lynch had carried out the ill-treatment by \"rough handling\" rather than wilful neglect.\nHe had \"dragged\" one patient around the bedroom, pulled another along a corridor for 14 metres, held patients by the wrists and - in one case - refused to allow a resident to go to the toilet, the judge said.\nThe patients, who cannot be named, included five men and one woman.\nThe court was told that Owen Mor nursing home on the Culmore Road in Derry deals with residents who are elderly and often at various stages of dementia.\nProsecutor Gary McCrudden told the court that Lynch had initially denied all the charges against him.\nBut he changed his pleas to \"guilty\" in October 2023.\n'There are consequences'\nBefore jailing Lynch, Judge Rafferty referred to victim impact statements from the families of Lynch's patients.\nOne victim's brother said he had been assaulted \"by a person in a position of trust - someone he trusted and someone who society trusted\".\nThe judge said Lynch had been guilty of a \"significant breach of trust\" over a period of a year, but he was satisfied he would never work in a care home again.\nJailing him for nine months, Judge Rafferty told Lynch: \"Those who engage in ill-treatment must understand that there are consequences.\nHe had been promoted \"above his level of experience\" due to the expansion of the care home where he worked, the judge said.\n\"Before this, you were completely blameless and of good character.\n\"That's what makes your actions all the more tragic.\"\nLynch's barrister, Brian McCartney KC, said his client had shown \"genuine remorse and shame\" for what he had done.\nHe came from a \"highly-respected family\" and the risk of re-offending was \"low\", the lawyer added.\nMr McCartney insisted that no physical harm had been caused to any of Lynch's patients.",

    "People screamed \"we are going to die\" as a boat holding more than 40 migrants started sinking crossing the English Channel, a court heard.\nAt least 43 people made the journey on 14 December 2022 - not all had life jackets and four men died.\nIbrahima Bah, who is over 18, is accused of steering the boat in return for free passage on it.\nHe denies four counts of manslaughter and a charge of facilitating a breach of immigration law.\nSurvivor Nesar Durrani, who is from Afghanistan, said he heard a man at the engine of the boat joke \"I will either take you there or kill you all\".\nThe boat began taking on water on its journey to the UK in the early hours, at which point people were scared and screaming, the court heard.\nOpening the case for the prosecution, Duncan Atkinson KC told the jury: \"As the pilot of a vessel carrying paying passengers, he owed each of them a duty of care, to ensure their safety and protect them from the overwhelming risk to their lives posed by an unchartered voyage in an unseaworthy boat across the open sea.\"\nOne of the four who lost their lives was named as Hajratullah Ahmadi. The other three were described as \"unknown\".\nThe majority of passengers paid thousands of euros to smugglers for a spot on the vessel, the court heard.\nJurors were told the low-quality inflatable should have no more than 20 people on board.\nA video showing migrants being rescued from the sinking boat was shown to the court.\nMr Atkinson continued: \"It would have been abundantly clear that there was an obvious and serious risk of death to those on board.\n\"Such a failure on his part for his passengers' safety, leading to the deaths of at least four of them, amounts to manslaughter by reason of his gross negligence.\"\nIn a later interview, Mr Durrani said: \"This was a matter of life and death and we were in a very difficult state.\n\"We were angry at the driver that steered, the person steering the boat because it was very fast speed.\"\nA number of migrants inside the boat described water reaching their knees within 30 minutes of leaving the French coastline.\nMr Atkinson said: \"Despite these increasing and obvious problems, the defendant continued to head into UK waters.\"\nUnder duress\nThe jury heard that a crew on a British fishing boat came across the sinking boat and tried to rescue the passengers, with help from the RNLI, air ambulance and UK Border Force.\nA total of 39 survivors were brought to shore in Dover. But the exact number of migrants who drowned is unknown, as it appears at least one person's body believed to have not been recovered, Mr Atkinson added.\nThe jury has been told that Mr Bah's defence is likely to be that he was acting under duress, claiming he was forced to undertake the role of pilot by the smugglers and that he had been both threatened and assaulted to make him do it.\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

    "A Ugandan government minister is facing criticism after calling those who have died of hunger in his country \"idiots\".\nMany have deemed Henry Okello Oryem's comments tone-deaf.\nIn 2022, more than 2,200 people died of starvation and related illnesses in north-east Uganda , a report by an official human rights body said.\nBut Mr Oryem argued that given Uganda's favourable climate and fertile land, people should be able to grow food for themselves.\n\"It's only an idiot, a real idiot, that can die of hunger in Uganda,\" the state minister for foreign affairs told the NTV Uganda television channel .\n\"If you work hard, there is land in Uganda. The climate is right in spite [of] climate change. If you make a double effort to make sure that you go out in the morning, you till your land, you plant the seeds, you maintain your plantation, surely, how do you fail then to get food?\"\nAs well as killing many people, the food shortage in the north-east left nearly half-a-million people in \"acute hunger\", said the report by the Uganda Human Rights Commission, which was established by the constitution.\nThe minister's comments have sparked outrage.\nMoses Aleper, a legislator for Chekwii county, which is part of the affected Karamoja region, told the BBC that Mr Oryem's views were \"not right\" and \"unfortunate coming from a minister who knows what goes on in this country\".\n\"I'm from one of the most productive parts of Karamoja where there is adequate rain and we produce food. But in situations where weather fails us, the weather vagaries set in, we definitely fail to get food. And normally people definitely get famine and eventually hunger strikes.\"\nMr Aleper also said that hunger in the region is often caused by \"other issues beyond even human control\", such as the way that the climate is changing.\nProminent Ugandan author and journalist Charles Onyango-Obbo also hit out at Mr Oryem, saying that the minister failed to grasp \"that hunger in a country like Uganda is a distribution/market problem\".\nOfficial data on the current food situation in Karamoja is unavailable, but it often experiences hunger during dry seasons due to the region's semi-arid climatic conditions.\nYou may also be interested in:",

    "Constance Marten and Mark Gordon's newborn baby was wearing only a nappy on a cold night, according to the taxi driver who drove them from Liverpool to Harwich, Essex, a court has been told.\nMs Marten, 36, and Mr Gordon, 49, are accused of the manslaughter of Victoria, whose body was found almost eight weeks later, on 1 March.\nThey were arrested on 27 February, having been on the run after a placenta was found in their burnt-out car.\nThe pair deny the charges.\nAli Yaryar, the taxi driver, said Ms Marten was carrying Victoria in her jacket, and that he was told the baby was \"too small\" for a car seat.\nGiving evidence via video-link at the Old Bailey on Monday, Mr Yaryar recalled how he was driving in his taxi in Liverpool on 5 January 2023 when he was flagged down by a man and a woman.\nHe told jurors that the couple asked to be driven to Harwich, a journey of almost 300 miles.\nAsked by prosecutor Joel Smith what his reaction was, Mr Yaryar said: \"I said this was a long journey \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but it is a quiet night, I can go there if you want for \u00c2\u00a3400.\"\nThe jury heard that earlier on the same day the Peugeot car Ms Marten and Mr Gordon had been driving in had caught on fire on the M61 in Greater Manchester.\nThey managed to get a lift into Bolton, and from there they took a minicab to Merseyside.\nA video shown in court showed Mr Gordon and Ms Marten, with the baby under her jacket, entering Bolton Interchange.\nWhen the couple got into his taxi in Liverpool, Ms Marten was \"shivering\" and asked for the heating to be turned on, Mr Yaryar told the jury.\nThe taxi driver said he suggested he could take the couple to Harwich in his personal car, an Audi which was warm and comfortable.\nHe said he went home with them to change cars.\nMr Smith asked the witness what he noticed about the woman.\nHe said: \"I noticed they are hiding something. There is a baby there inside the jacket.\"\n\"She was holding it and I asked 'Do you have a baby there?' and she said 'Yes'\".\nThe taxi driver offered to get them a car seat from his home, but was told the baby was \"too small\".\nThe court heard the couple paid \u00c2\u00a3400 upfront in cash for the trip.\nMr Yaryar said during the journey he stopped at a service station to buy a charger.\nWhen he returned to the car the woman handed the baby to the man while she went inside to buy some food and drinks and nappies.\nProsecutor Joel Smith asked the witness what the baby was wearing at that stage.\n\"I didn't see very well. The baby had no clothes on except a nappy,\" Mr Yaryar replied.\nThe taxi driver recalled hearing the baby crying.\nHe told jurors the couple later argued at one point. Asked what he heard, Mr Yaryar said the \"lady was complaining about he's not very helpful\".\nHe said when he dropped them in Harwich it was cold and they had no bags and no phone.\nMr Yaryar said that a few days later he saw a news article with coverage of the missing couple and that he recognised them as the two who were in his car.\nDuring cross-examination, John Femi-Ola KC, defence barrister for Mr Gordon, suggested the baby was having its nappy changed in the car and that was why \"she had no clothes\" at that point.\nMs Constance and Mr Gordon arrived in Harwich in the early hours of 6 January.\nThe couple checked into a Premier Inn at 03:00, with Ms Marten giving their surname as \"Thomas\", the court heard.\nIn a witness statement read to court, Taylor Roy, who checked the couple in, said the woman was \"quite distressed\" when she arrived in reception.\nHe said she had a blanket wrapped around her chest which \"contained a raised bit\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and a second raised bit\".\nMr Roy added that \"the shape of the blanket made me think she had a baby inside\".\nWhen the couple checked out of the Premier Inn the next afternoon, the duty receptionist, Rae Robson, who went to the room to encourage them to leave, said she noticed \"the smell\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 as soon as the door opened\".\n\"A really, really bad small. Like rotten flesh. I couldn't stay in that room very long,\" she told the court.\nDale Gosling, who offered Ms Marten, Mr Gordon and their baby a lift to hospital from Harwich on 6 January after recognising the couple from news reports, said the \"brand new\" baby sounded \"distressed\".\nHe said the baby's cry was one he \"couldn't walk away from\".\nMr Gosling said he confronted the couple and asked if they were the \"people who are on the telly advertised as missing with the new baby\".\nMr Gordon denied it was them, the jury heard.\nThe witness told the jury he then offered the couple and their baby a lift to the hospital, which they declined.\nThe trial has previously heard the couple, who have had four other children together, were living rough in a bid to evade social services, as they feared their new-born child would be removed.\nMs Marten has not been in court for any of the three days of her trial.\nAs well as manslaughter, the couple are also accused of four other offences - cruelty to their baby; concealment of the baby's birth; causing or allowing her death; and perve",

    "When Julia Wandelt posted on social media that she believed she was Madeleine McCann, she became a lightning rod for online anger. In the first of a new series of stories exploring extraordinary cases of online hate and the possibility of forgiveness, Julia reveals for the first time her motives and regrets.\nAs Julia Wandelt plays guitar to me in her bedroom in Poland, we're surrounded by teddy bears. One is bright pink, wearing a T-shirt that reads: \"You Got This!\"\nIt was a gift, the 22-year-old says, from some of her new followers. She got to know them after creating an Instagram account called @iammadeleinemccan - referring to the British girl who went missing in Portugal in 2007 but missing the final \"n\" from her surname.\nMadeleine McCann's disappearance at the age of three - which remains unsolved - is one of the most widely reported in history. Online communities of obsessives have grown up around the case, and Julia's account was like petrol thrown onto a fire already burning across social media sites like Instagram, TikTok and X.\n\"I never meant to hurt anyone - including [the] McCanns,\" she told me. \"I really wanted to know who I am.\"\nIf she were to go back in time, Julia says she would never have made the Madeleine McCann profile.\n\"I would never go on social media. It can destroy you,\" she explained.\nFor a BBC Radio 4 podcast series called Why Do You Hate Me? , I'm tracking down deep-fakers, conspiracy theorists, impersonators and those harmed online, to find out why some people behave the way they do on social media.\nI'm starting with Julia, because her case seemed to be one of the most extraordinary I'd spotted.\nThe original account she posted on as Madeleine at the start of 2023 no longer exists. But among the online groups of Madeleine McCann obsessives was one dedicated to analysing Julia's social media posts, which is where I found her personal account.\nAfter I messaged her, Julia told me she wanted to share her side of the story. Because she has spoken openly about her past struggles with her mental health, we chatted multiple times on the phone over several weeks, as well as meeting in person - so we could be confident she was making an informed decision about speaking out.\nWe first met at her flat in Poland. As I arrived, I was greeted by a loud meow from Julia's cat Monty. Now, rather than posting about the Madeleine McCann case, Julia shares videos of him doing tricks.\nSo, who exactly is Julia? And why did she post on social media that she was Madeleine? Julia says what happened had its roots in a traumatic childhood.\nWhy Do You Hate Me?\nOne of the BBC's most trolled journalists, Marianna Spring, dives into her inbox and investigates extraordinary cases of online hate. She meets the people at the heart of these conflicts, and in some cases brings them together, to see if understanding - even forgiveness - is ever possible.\nListen now on BBC Sounds or watch on BBC iPlayer .\nShe says she was isolated at school and that as a young child she was sexually abused.\nMusic became her escape, she says. From time to time as we talk, she picks up her guitar and sings an improvised song. \"It's still the way to deal with difficulties in my life,\" Julia says.\nLater, aged about 20, she was in therapy and started to realise her memories from childhood were patchy - with chunks of time where she couldn't remember much at all.\nPsychiatrists and psychologists I've spoken to say it's common to experience memory loss if you've been abused. It's the brain's way of protecting us, they say.\nJulia started to wonder if the blanks in her memory might hide a big secret - that maybe she had been adopted. She began to ask her relatives to help fill in the gaps.\n\"For example, can you show me some pictures from childhood? Can you show me your pregnancy photos?\" Julia says.\nShe says her family dismissed her concerns that she might be adopted, and wouldn't answer her questions. That only served to fuel her suspicions.\nJulia began to wonder whether there was an even more disturbing reason for their defensiveness. Could she have been kidnapped?\nFrustrated by her family's silence, Julia turned to the internet for answers. She started googling missing persons websites from her bedroom.\nThat was when she found Madeleine's case. Julia told me she had never heard of her disappearance before, since it had not been such a big news story in Poland.\nOn the profiles of missing people there are sometimes sketches or e-fits of potential suspects - and Julia thought she recognised one of the men on Madeleine's profile.\n\"I know [what] my abuser looks like. And I know this is very, very similar to the suspects from [the] Madeleine McCann page.\"\nJulia's mind went into overdrive.

    "This article reveals the outcome of the second series of The Traitors\nAfter weeks of backstabbing, plotting and social media memes, the winner of The Traitors has been revealed.\nHarry Clark, who was one of the original three chosen as traitors at the start of the second series, took home the \u00c2\u00a395,150 prize money.\nHe and faithful Mollie Pearce were the last remaining players, after both voted to eliminate faithful Jaz Singh.\nMollie admitted to the BBC that she \"chose the wrong person to trust\" - but said Harry had promised her a holiday.\n\"It was a game at the end of the day, we all signed up for it,\" she added.\nHarry said he \"just wanted to get the job done\", telling BBC Breakfast: \"I didn't know I could lie that well and keep it up.\n\"The first couple of days I was struggling, because you're lying to people and building relationships out of a lie. It was just mad.\"\nHarry said he found the ending of the show \"very difficult\" even though he won the prize.\nHe added: \"I like to think I'm a nice person. So even though I wanted to run down the street with my top off screaming that I've won \u00c2\u00a3100,000, I don't want to do it at other people's heartache.\"\nThe final episode was watched live by 5.5 million people, with a peak audience of 6.9 million. That figure will rise with catch-up audience numbers.\nThe British Army engineer has been congratulated by his employer on X , with the Army saying his win was a testament to his \"resilience and commitment\".\nHarry went largely undetected through the series, with Jaz - nicknamed Jazatha Christie by fans as a nod to detective novel writer Agatha Christie - one of the few to suspect he could be a traitor.\nBut in the last episode, viewers saw Harry come perilously close to being voted out. Mollie began to write his name down for banishment, before changing her mind and voting for Jaz, leaving just her and Harry standing.\nHer decision meant Harry won all of the prize money - as if any traitors remain at the end of the game they take all the gold for themselves.\nMollie swore and stormed out after Harry revealed himself as a traitor, but has since said they are now friends again and that he \"played a good game\".\nEarlier on in the final episode, Evie Morrison, a veterinary nurse from Inverness, was banished at the final round table, before revealing that she was a faithful.\nAnother traitor, Welsh insurance broker Andrew Jenkins , was then banished as the remaining four contestants gathered around the fire and voted him out.\nJaz, who had successfully identified four traitors during the course of the game, said the ending was a \"difficult pill to swallow\" but the group had \"recovered\".\nHe said he was initially \"dying to be a traitor\" and put his detection skills down to being \"hyper-vigilant\" and not getting too close to anyone.\nHis super sleuthing was praised by viewers. Some joked on social media that he should solve real life mysteries or be put in charge of Scotland Yard or MI5.\nThe second series has been hailed as a celebration of event television in an age of streaming and catch-up. Many fans were determined to watch each episode live, to avoid spoilers and be able to share theories on social media.\nThe final was shown live in some cinemas and pubs, with fans seen screaming at the screen as Mollie failed to see through Harry's deception.\nX user @ListerLister wrote \"Having now watched The Traitors at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, I ABSOLUTELY understand how footie fans get so buzzed watching matches in the pub.\"\nAnother viewer, called Shane Reaction, said: \"Now that my nerves have somewhat recovered, how lucky are we to be living in the all new age of event TV?\n\"Claudia, the players, the producers, the stylists... everyone involved needs to take a bow.

    "A 90-day state of emergency has been declared by officials in Portland as part of an effort to tackle the use of fentanyl in Oregon's largest city.\nA synthetic painkiller 50 times more powerful than heroin, fentanyl has been blamed for a rise in US drug deaths.\nIn Oregon, the rise coincided with a move to decriminalise the use of most drugs, including fentanyl.\nBut on Tuesday, senior state and city officials said Portland was being damaged by open use of the drug.\nThe city has been struggling from homelessness and drug use in recent years, causing several major businesses and some residents to move out of the city.\nAccording to Multnomah County - where Portland is located - the number of overdose deaths involving fentanyl increased by 533% between 2018 and 2022.\nGovernor Tina Kotek, announcing the state of emergency, conceded that the city was suffering \"economic and reputational harm\" from the ongoing fentanyl problem.\n\"Our country and our state have never seen a drug this deadly addictive, and all are grappling with how to respond,\" she said in a statement.\nAccompanied by Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and Multnomah County Chair Jessica Vega Pederson on Tuesday, Gov Kotek announced a new \"tri-government\" action to tackle the issue.\nThe order establishes a temporary \"command centre... where state, county and city employees will convene to coordinate strategies and response efforts,\" the officials said in a joint statement.\nThe plan also calls for the state health department to launch an advertising campaign on billboards, public transit and online which will promote drug prevention and treatment.\nIt also calls for more peer outreach and resources for addicts, and for police to crackdown on open drug dealing.\nGov Kotek said the three leaders will act with \"urgency and unity across our public health and community safety systems to make a dent in this crisis\".\n\"The next 90 days will yield unprecedented collaboration and focused resources targeting fentanyl and provide a roadmap for next steps,\" she added.\nIn 2020, residents of Oregon passed Measure 110, which decriminalised most drug use. Under the law, police encountering fentanyl users are meant to refer addicts to treatment centres, however many ignore the referral.\nOpioid deaths in the state jumped from 738 in 2021, the first year the law was in effect, to 956 in 2022, according to state data.\nMs Kotek has previously called on state lawmakers to pass legislation that criminalises public drug use, similar to \"open container\" alcohol laws in the US.\nBut moves to roll back the state's liberal drug laws could face opposition from addiction-treatment groups, who say re-criminalisation will drive people to take fentanyl in private, possibly increasing overdose rates.",

    "Gaza is home to some of the oldest churches and mosques in the world, but many have not escaped the widespread destruction of Israel's military offensive.\nOf 117 religious sites which were reportedly damaged or destroyed between 7 October, when Israel's campaign began, and 31 December, the BBC has verified 74 cases. Seventy-two are mosques and two are churches. Israel's offensive was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on 7 October.\nIn its investigation, the BBC used satellite imagery and user generated content to examine evidence from both before and after buildings were hit.\nIn a statement, Hamas - the Palestinian Islamist group which rules Gaza - said 378 mosques and three churches had been hit up to 9 January, though this figure has not been independently verified.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says Hamas fighters are using places of worship for cover and as places from which to launch attacks - something Hamas denies.\n'An immediate death'\nBelieved to be one of the oldest churches in the world, St Porphyrius is one of a handful dotted around the Gaza Strip. Many of the territory's small Christian population, which before the war numbered about 1,000, has a strong connection to the land. St Porphyrius was a 5th Century bishop in Gaza whose tomb lies under the church.\nLike many Palestinian Christians, Marian Saba and her family sought refuge within the church grounds, believing they would be safe. But on 19 October, as the night drew in, an Israeli missile hit one of the church's outer buildings, killing 18 people and injuring many more.\nMarian said her 34-year-old brother-in-law Soliman was killed as he shielded his son from a collapsing wall. \"It was a horrifying scene. I have never seen a dead body. I didn't know what to say,\" she said. \"It was an immediate death.\"\nRami Tarazi was in one of the church's halls at the time of the blast. \"It was a rocket missile that was so big even the people who were in the other hall came out in white dust,\" he said of the explosion, which did not impact the main building.\n\"We pulled out 16 people in pieces and two full corpses,\" he vividly recalls. One of the people killed was Rami's 36-year-old cousin Suliman, who Rami says had been \"talking and laughing\" with him just an hour earlier.\nAccording to international humanitarian law, intentionally targeting religious buildings during conflict is a war crime. There is an exception, however, if such sites are being used for military purposes.\nVideos uploaded by the IDF to social media show soldiers entering religious buildings it has targeted and showing underground tunnels it says were used by Hamas.\nIn this case, the IDF told the BBC that the church was not the intended target of the strike despite its grounds being hit as a result. It said the incident was under review.\nSome videos and photos being shared online also purport to show Israeli soldiers disrespecting the sanctity of religious places and glorifying destruction.\nOne image seen on X, formerly known as Twitter, shows an Israeli soldier posing in front of a fallen minaret which has been graffitied in Hebrew with the words \"the temple will be rebuilt\" - a reference to a belief that a third Jewish temple will be built on the contested holy site in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif or the al-Aqsa Mosque compound.\nThe IDF said the behaviour of the soldier in the image was \"severe and not in accordance with the IDF's values\", adding that it was investigating the incident.\nDr Georgia Andreou from the Institute of Archaeology at University College London has been looking into the destruction of heritage sites in the Gaza Strip. She says many holy sites have great historical significance, and that the destruction of sacred, as well as heritage, sites in Gaza is \"the worst I have ever seen\".\n'I miss the sound of prayer'\nMany of the mosques in Gaza have been razed, and unlike those who take shelter in churches, Palestinian Muslims are choosing to seek refuge away from their places of worship.\nIn Khan Younis, the BBC verified that Khalil Al-Rahman mosque, which had reportedly been hit in an air strike in the area, had been damaged.\nAs a devout Muslim, Renad Alaa al-Bataa frequented this mosque, where she learnt to memorise the Quran. But since the war started she has not been back.\n\"Previously, the IDF seldom targeted mosques unless there were alleged militant targets. But this time, they've destroyed several beautiful mosques that nurtured us and taught us about our religion,\" she said.\nDuring a week-long truce that took place in November, she says, the muezzin - the person who makes the call to prayer - devised a makeshift minaret and began calling for prayers five times a day from the top of what remains of Khalil Al-Rahman mosque. She says it brought her a sense of security that ended when Israel resumed fighting against Hamas.\nOne of the starkest images of destruction to emerge from Khan Younis is a video that shows ",

    "Playing a musical instrument or singing could help keep the brain healthy in older age, UK researchers suggest.\nPractising and reading music may help sustain good memory and the ability to solve complex tasks, their study says.\nIn their report, published in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, they say music should be considered as part of a lifestyle approach to maintain the brain.\nMore than 1,100 people aged over 40, with a mean age of 68, were studied.\nScientists at the University of Exeter observed their brain function data as part of a wider study that has been finding out how brains age, and why people develop dementia.\nThey looked at the effects of playing an instrument, singing, reading and listening to music, and musical ability.\nThe researchers compared the cognitive data of those in the study who engaged in music in some way in their lives, with those who never had.\nTheir results showed that people who played musical instruments benefitted the most, which may be because of the \"multiple cognitive demands\" of the activity.\nPlaying the piano or keyboard appeared to be particularly beneficial, while brass and woodwind instruments were good too.\nSimply listening to music did not appear to help cognitive health.\nThe benefit seen with singing might be partly because of the known social aspects of being in a choir or group, the researchers say.\n\"Because we have such sensitive brain tests for this study, we are able to look at individual aspects of the brain function, such as short-term memory, long-term memory, and problem-solving and how engaging music effects that,\" lead author Prof Anne Corbett told the BBC.\n\"Certainly this confirms and cements on a much larger scale what we already know about the benefits of music.\n\"Specifically, playing an instrument has a particularly big effect, and people who continue to play into an older age saw an additional benefit,\" she said.\nPublic health message\nIn the study, people who read music regularly had better numerical memory.\nProf Corbett said: \"Our brain is a muscle like anything else and it needs to be exercised, and learning to read music is a bit like learning a new language, it's challenging.\"\nResearchers did not test potential benefits of taking up a musical hobby for the first time later in life, but Prof Corbett said she believed, based on current evidence, it would be \"very beneficial\".\nProf Corbett said that, although more research was needed, promoting musical education could form a \"valuable\" part of a public health message, as would encouraging older adults to return to music in later life.\n\"The message is around how people can proactively reduce their risk of cognitive decline or dementia, and really thinking about engaging with music as a way of doing that. This study does suggest that it could be part of a much wider lifestyle approach to improving brain health as you age.\"\nHowever, she said: \"It would be na\u00c3\u00afve to think taking up a musical instrument would mean you won't develop dementia. It's not as simple as that.\"\nDementia UK said the results were \"positive\".\n\"The ability to make or play music - whether by singing or playing an instrument - can continue even when people living with dementia have lost other abilities and means of communication,\" the charity's Caroline Scates said.\n\"If you know someone living with dementia who enjoys, or has enjoyed, singing or playing an instrument, it can be beneficial to keep these instruments or sheet music to hand for them to play or read.\"\nStuart Douglas, 78, has played the accordion regularly since the age of eight. He said it kept his brain \"active\" and said it helps others too.\n\"We regularly play at memory cafes so have seen the effect that our music has on people with memory loss and, as older musicians ourselves, we have no doubt that continuing with music into older age has played an important role in keeping our brains healthy.\"\nThe study was supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research.",

It shows what they are and the way they have worked to be honest,\" he told BBC Cymru Fyw .\n\"It scares you, not only what they have done to me but to so many different people.\"\nHe added: \"I doubted it from the beginning but it still scares you how they have been carrying on, changing things just to save the company's skin.\n\"I was one of the first to complain that Horizon was not right, but at the time, going back to 2005/2006, there was no hope.\n\"It's not right for someone to find fault with our solicitors and so on.

    "Iran has denied involvement in a drone attack on a US base near Jordan's border with Syria that killed three US troops.\nThe US blamed the attack, which also left dozens injured, on \"radical Iranian-backed militant groups\".\nUS President Biden vowed revenge and said: \"We shall respond.\"\nIt is the first time that a strike has killed US troops in the region since the start of the war in Gaza triggered by Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.\nThere have been other attacks on US bases in the region, but before Sunday there were no fatalities, according to the US military.\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed it was behind the attack.\nThe umbrella group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq. It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.\nIn a statement, the group said it had targeted three US bases in Syria - identifying them as Shaddadi, Tanf and Rukban. However, Rukban is on the Jordanian side of the border with Syria. The group also said it targeted an Israeli oil facility in the Mediterranean.\nThe BBC's US partner CBS reported that US troops were in their sleeping quarters when the drone struck their Tower 22 base in the early hours of the morning.\nA defence official said the drone came in \"very low and very slow\" at the same time that a US drone was returning to the base from a mission.\nAs a result, the auto-response features of the air defence system were turned off so as not to shoot down the US drone, the official said, which meant there was little to no warning for troops at the base.\nThe Iraqi government has condemned the attack and called for \"an end to the cycle of violence\" in the Middle East.\nIraqi government spokesman Bassem al-Awadi said it was willing \"to collaborate on establishing fundamental rules to prevent further repercussions in the region and curb the escalation of conflict\".\nMr Biden said the US \"will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing\".\nOn Monday White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the US was seeking a \"very consequential\" response to the attack but does not want a wider war with Iran or the region.\nThe administration believed a single drone was used to target US troops in Jordan, Mr Kirby said.\nIran denied US and British accusations that it supported militant groups blamed for the strike.\nNasser Kanaani, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, said it was \"not involved in the decision making of resistance groups\" in how they chose to \"defend Palestinians or their own countries\".\nIran's intelligence minister Esmail Khatib said that regional armed groups aligned with Iran respond to \"American aggressors\" at their own discretion.\nThe White House said Mr Biden was briefed about the attack on Sunday morning by US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and other officials.\n\"Jill and I join the families and friends of our fallen - and Americans across the country - in grieving the loss of these warriors in this despicable and wholly unjust attack,\" Mr Biden said in a statement.\nThe names of the servicemen killed and injured have not yet been released as officials work to notify their families.\nUK Prime Minister \u00e2\u0080\u008bRishi Sunak condemned the attack and urged Iran to \"continue to de-escalate tensions\" in the region.\n\"We stand resolutely with our allies to bring stability and peace to the region,\" he said.\nDowning Street echoed the US assessment and said it believed \"the attack was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq\".\nUS officials said at least 34 military personnel were being evaluated for possible traumatic brain injury, and that some of the injured soldiers were medically evacuated from the base for further treatment.\nThey also said the drone struck living quarters at the base, which, if confirmed, could explain the high number of casualties.\nUS Central Command and President Biden said the attack was on a base in Rukban, northeastern Jordan, near the Syrian border. It was later named by US officials as Tower 22.\nIn December, US officials said that US bases in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 97 times since 17 October.\nLast month, the US carried out airstrikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US servicemembers were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.\nEarlier in January, one retaliatory US strike in Baghdad killed a militia leader accused of being behind attacks on US personnel.\nIn a pre-recorded interview with ABC News that aired on Sunday morning, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen CQ Brown said that America's aim in the region is to \"not have the conflict broaden\".\n\"The goal is to deter them and we don't want to go down a path of greater escalation that drives to a much broader conflict within the region.\"\nUS and coalition troops are also stationed in the Red Sea after the Iran-backed Houthis began attacking commercial ships in the region.

    "Pakistan's former three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif only returned from self-imposed exile last year but is now the clear front-runner to win the 8 February election.\nFew could have predicted his return to the top, despite his dominance in Pakistani politics for much of these past three decades.\nHis last term ended in him being convicted of corruption, and the time before that, he was toppled in a military coup.\nStill, he appears on the brink of making another successful comeback, a dramatic turnaround for someone who had long been viewed as an opponent to Pakistan's powerful military.\n\"He's a top candidate to be the next premier not because he's wildly popular - he certainly is not - but more so because he's played his cards right,\" says analyst Michael Kugelman, the South Asia Director at the Wilson Center think tank.\nMr Sharif's arch-rival and former prime minister Imran Khan - previously backed by the military - is now the one locked up in jail, his popular party restricted across the country.\nWhat's his story?\nOne might say that Mr Sharif is the king of comebacks. He's certainly done it before.\nOusted from his second term in a 1999 military coup, he returned in the 2013 parliamentary elections, staging a triumphant comeback to become prime minister for a record third term.\nThat was a historic moment for the country, as it was the first transition from one democratically elected government to another since independence in 1947.\nBut Nawaz Sharif's last period in office was marred by upheavals - starting with a six-month opposition blockade of the capital Islamabad, and ending with court proceedings over corruption allegations which eventually led to the Supreme Court disqualifying him in July 2017. He resigned shortly afterwards.\nIn July 2018 he was found guilty of corruption by a court in Pakistan and given a 10-year sentence. But he was released two months later when the court suspended the sentences, pending a final judgement.\nBy December 2018 however, he was jailed for corruption again, this time for seven years, in relation to his family's ownership of steel mills in Saudi Arabia.\nHe then fought for bail arguing he needed medical treatment in the UK . This was granted in 2019, allowing him to flee to London where he lived in a luxury flat in exile for four years until his return last October.\nEven in absentia though, he has been one of the country's leading politicians for the past 35 years.\nEarly years\nNawaz Sharif was born into the family of a prominent Lahore industrialist in 1949 and made his mark in politics representing an urban constituency.\nA prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 of military leader Gen Zia ul-Haq - who ruled Pakistan from 1977 to 1988 - Mr Sharif is perhaps best known outside Pakistan for ordering the country's first nuclear tests in 1998.\nHe first came to national prominence during the early days of Gen Zia's martial law, serving as Punjab province's finance and then chief minister from 1985-1990.\nObservers recall him as not being a particularly impressive political figure, but said he nonetheless proved himself an adept administrator. He became prime minister in 1990, but was dismissed in 1993, clearing the way for the then opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto, to form a government.\nOwner of Ittefaq Group, a leading steel mill conglomerate, he is among the country's wealthiest industrialists.\nMilitary coup\nAfter becoming prime minister again in 1997 with a comfortable majority, Mr Sharif appeared to dominate the political landscape and exerted a powerful hold over all the country's major institutions - apart from the army.\nThen, frustrated by opposition in parliament, he tried to pass a constitutional amendment that would have enabled him to enforce Sharia law. He also confronted other power centres - a mob of his supporters ransacked the Supreme Court and he tried to rein in Pakistan's powerful military.\nBut Mr Sharif's overthrowing in 1999 by then army chief Pervez Musharraf showed how dangerous it was for any politician to attempt to curtail the military's influence in Pakistan.\nMr Sharif was arrested, jailed and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of hijacking and terrorism. He was also convicted of corruption and banned for life from political activities.\nBut an alleged deal, brokered by the Saudis, saved him and other family members from being put behind bars. Mr Sharif and 40 members of his family were exiled to Saudi Arabia for what was supposed to be a period of 10 years.\nOwen Bennett-Jones, BBC Islamabad correspondent at the time, recalls that when Mr Sharif was removed from power, many Pakistanis expressed great relief, describing him as corrupt, incompetent and power-hungry.\nCorruption allegations\nMr Sharif's first time in the political wilderness lasted until his triumphal return to Pakistan in 2007 following a deal with the military.\nBack in Pakistan, he patiently bided his time in opposition. His PML-N party won about a quarter of parliamentary seats in the 2008 elect",
    "A 23-year-old man has been arrested after the Manchester United team bus was damaged when a bottle was thrown at it before a Liverpool game.\nMerseyside Police said the bus was hit as it made its way along Anfield Road near the Tia Hotel on 17 December.\nThe bottle caused a hairline crack to the side window but nobody was injured, the force said.\nThe arrested man, from Everton, has been released under investigation.

    "Residents are being urged to have their say on a proposed tax hike across the county.\nA consultation on Lincolnshire County Council's budget plans for the financial year 2024/2025 is due to end on Tuesday.\nThe Conservative-led authority is proposing a 4.99% increase to council tax, which equates to an extra \u00c2\u00a31.44 per week for a Band D property.\nIt would raise an extra \u00c2\u00a318m, council bosses said.\nLeader Martin Hill said the authority had managed to find savings of about \u00c2\u00a39m by \"streamlining operations\" but now faced additional cost pressures of \u00c2\u00a361m due to rising prices and increased demand for services.\nMr Hill said the authority, which takes about three quarters of the money households pay in council tax, expected to spend almost \u00c2\u00a3650m in 2024/25, including \u00c2\u00a3305m on adult care, \u00c2\u00a3114m on children's services and \u00c2\u00a349m on highways.\nAn additional \u00c2\u00a34m is earmarked for longer-term flood prevention schemes.\nMr Hill said flooding was \"a real concern for residents\", brought to the fore by the damage caused by recent storms.\nHowever, despite the proposed increase, he said the authority remained in \"a stable position\", adding there were no plans to cut services.\n\"Our council tax rate is set to remain one of the lowest in the country for a shire county,\" he said.\nLonger term, he added, councils in Greater Lincolnshire were looking to secure a devolution deal, which would see more local decision-making and funding transferred from the government.\n\"We believe this is the best way available to us to ensure we get the investment we need.\"\nParticipants in the survey have three options to choose from and a summary of their views will be shared with the executive on 6 February, where they will consider the final budget for recommendation to full council on 23 February.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram .

    "Plans to stop the legal requirement to publish notices of council tax charges in newspapers could have \"catastrophic unintended consequences\", a Senedd committee has heard.\nMedia organisations have warned of \"damage\" to Welsh journalism and ultimately to democracy in Wales.\nThe change would \"disproportionately impact older people\" the Older People's Commissioner has said.\nBut another news outlet said the law is \"archaic\" and needs reform.\nThe Welsh government's consultation on the Local Government Finance (Wales) Bill includes proposals such as increasing the frequency of revaluations of the non-domestic rates system to three-yearly.\nThe proposals also suggest establishing a five-yearly cycle of revaluations of the council tax system.\nThere is also a clause to replace the current requirement to publish information of the council tax charges in newspapers with a requirement to publish a notice on the local authority's website, and \"put suitable alternative arrangements in place to ensure that such information is accessible to citizens who have difficulty accessing online facilities\".\nThe Welsh Local Government Association has told the Senedd's local government committee that local authorities across Wales spend around \u00c2\u00a333,000 a year on the tax notices.\nSome media organisations are concerned there could be future changes to lucrative notice requirements in other areas, such as planning and transport.\nGavin Thompson, regional editor at Newsquest - which has local newspapers in Wales including the Leader in Wrexham, the Rhyl Journal, the Western Telegraph in Pembrokeshire and the South Wales Argus - told the committee the clause \"would have catastrophic unintended consequences for the local newspaper sector in Wales\".\nWhile acknowledging that this Bill deals specifically with notices on council tax changes, he said these proposals would \"set a direction of travel\" for other areas, such as planning and transport.\nHe said six out of the ten Newquest local papers would have been loss-making last year without public notice revenue.\n\"As a business, we would not be able to continue printing loss-making titles,\" he warned.\n\"It would mean fewer journalists and fewer journalists in Wales. It would also mean that Wales has a worse climate for local news than England.\"\n'Even more challenging'\nSpeaking on behalf of Reach, the editor of WalesOnline, Steffan Rhys, said statutory public notices were an important source of income for news publishers at a time when their revenue is under \"extreme pressure\".\nThe proposed changes would make \"a challenging situation even more challenging\".\nMr Rhys said: \"If you remove the requirement to put public notices in print titles, you are removing that information from a certain part of the public - there's no two ways about it.\n\"You're also removing revenue from publishers, that means publishers are able to do less journalism and that means the public is even less informed, so it's almost a circular effect.\"\nHowever Rob Taylor from independent news outlet Wrexham.com, said the current law was \"archaic\" and welcomed the Welsh government's proposals.\n\"Back in the day, yes, circulations were huge and points of reference for many, many people - but the landscape has changed and it's a bad law, it's an out-of-date law.\"\nHe said the current law is \"anti competitive along with restricting startup, or growth, of entities such as ourselves\".\nRachel Bowen, director of policy at the office of the older people's commissioner for Wales, told the committee the proposals were further evidence of a \"creep towards digitalisation and increasing exclusion\".\nShe said the Welsh government's promise of \"suitable alternative arrangements\" was also an ambiguous replacement to the more specific requirement to publish in newspapers, and risked being an inadequate alternative.",
    "Republican governors in half of the US have backed Texas in an intensifying standoff with the federal government over illegal immigration.\nThe Supreme Court ruled this week against Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who has strung razor wire along miles of the frontier with Mexico.\nBut the Republican has vowed to add more razor wire to crack down on what he calls an invasion.\nA record 300,000-plus illegal migrants crossed the border in December alone.\nOn Thursday, 25 Republican governors released a joint statement of solidarity with Mr Abbott for \"stepping up to protect American citizens from historic levels of illegal immigrants, deadly drugs like fentanyl, and terrorists entering our country\".\nThe latest border flashpoint focuses on a small stretch of the Rio Grande River that has become one of the busiest spots for migrants crossing illegally from Mexico.\nAs part of his Operation Lone Star, Mr Abbott has sought to block or deter entry into his state, including by installing about 30 miles (48km) of razor wire barriers along the city of Eagle Pass.\nOn Monday the Supreme Court handed a victory to the administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in its standoff with Texas.\nThe justices ruled by 5-4 that US Border Patrol, a federal agency, could cut or clear out the concertina wire set up by the Texas National Guard.\nThe justice department had argued the fencing hampers the work of Border Patrol agents in that it poses a danger to both migrants and law enforcement. Some of the illegal migrants have cut themselves on the wire.\nAppearing on Fox News on Thursday, Mr Abbott said: \"Because the Biden administration has really, truly abdicated its responsibility to secure the border and enforce the laws, Texas, very simply, is securing the border.\"\nHe has posted photos of the Texas National Guard laying down new razor wire along the river.\nThe move does not appear to violate the Supreme Court order, which granted permission for the removal of existing wire, while saying nothing about adding new barriers.\nDemocrats are urging the president to take a tougher stance against Texas.\n\"Governor Greg Abbott is using the Texas National Guard to obstruct and create chaos at the border,\" congressman Joaquin Castro wrote on X, calling for federal control over the guardsmen.\nGovernor Abbott is also facing legal challenges from the Biden White House over his orders to install floating barriers in the Rio Grande and to jail thousands of migrants on trespassing charges.\nAnd, as the governor continues to bus migrants to Democratic cities and states, pressure is mounting on Mr Biden to take drastic action to stem the flow of arrivals.\nLast week, Mr Biden said he was \"ready to act\", but argued lawmakers on Capitol Hill must first agree on significant policy reforms.\nThe prospects of a grand bargain, however, in either chamber of Congress, let alone both, appear slim.\nRepublicans in the US House of Representatives are currently leading an effort to impeach and remove the president's top border official, Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nAn emerging bipartisan border deal in the US Senate meanwhile faces objections from right and left.\nFormer President Donald Trump, the Republican White House frontrunner, has reportedly pressured allies to kill the bill to avoid giving Mr Biden a win in an election year.\nImmigration is a central issue ahead of the November 2024 general election, with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire delivering primary victories to Mr Trump in part due to their concerns over the border.",

    "Broadband and mobile phone firms should ditch plans for \"grossly unfair\" bill increases this spring, argues Which?.\nConsumers are still facing price rises linked to inflation plus an extra charge, the consumer group says.\nThat is despite new rules that are expected to come into force later this year that will ban this approach.\nBT said it had been \"clear and transparent\" over its rises. Shell Energy Broadband said it was keeping rises below those of its rivals.\nOther phone and broadband companies declined to comment on Which?'s figures, which suggested some customers could be paying up to \u00c2\u00a335 more for their broadband over the next year and up to \u00c2\u00a327 more for a Sim-only phone contract, after prices rise in April.\nThe alternative - paying a fee to exit the contract early - was often much more costly, as much as \u00c2\u00a3339 for some Vodafone customers, Which? said.\nRocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy for the consumer group, said it was \"outrageous\" that firms were forcing their customers to accept big price hikes, or face punitive exit fees.\n\"Telecoms providers must do the right thing by halting unfair price hikes immediately, rather than piling more misery on their customers,\" he said.\nAccess to the internet is increasingly being seen as a basic necessity, akin to a utility such as electricity and gas.\nShopping, education, entertainment, socialising and accessing key government services and information rely on internet access, prompting a campaign from Which? for clearer and fairer pricing for telecoms customers.\nLast spring, many broadband and phone customers were shocked by steep price increases.\nThat is because in 2022 the cost of living rose sharply and phone and broadband providers currently calculate bill rises based on inflation - using either the CPI index or the typically higher RPI index  -  then add on an additional 3.9% or similar figure.\nIn the wake of those price rises last year the regulator Ofcom produced a report that found this way of presenting mid-contract bill rises caused \"substantial consumer harm\" because it was less transparent and made it harder to shop around for the best deal.\nOfcom is now consulting on new rules , likely to come into force later this year, that will require firms to show future bill rises \"in pounds and pence\" rather than as an inflation-linked formula.\nWhich? says phone and broadband providers who are still putting up prices this April according to the old system, or who are tying new customers into 12 or 24 month contracts using the old methods, are cynically cashing in before the rules change.\nBy Which?'s calculations EE mobile customers face a price hike of \u00c2\u00a324.84 over the coming year from April. But leaving the contract would incur a \u00c2\u00a3289.64 exit fee. Other firms put their customers in a similar \"trap\", Which? said.\nCustomers who have BT broadband will pay \u00c2\u00a335.92 extra in the coming year. If they wanted to switch to another provider they would face an exit fee of \u00c2\u00a3218.64, Which? said, assuming they are a typical customer with 12 months left to run on the contract.\nBroadband customers of Vodafone, EE or TalkTalk would see slightly lower price rises, but also faced exit fees that dwarfed the price rises, in the case of a Vodafone Sim-only mobile contract, the exit fee could be as high as \u00c2\u00a3339.71, Which? said.\nBT, which also owns EE and Plusnet, said its upcoming 31 March increase, calculated using CPI measure of inflation, which was 4% in December, plus an additional 3.9%, would amount to around \u00c2\u00a33 per month for most customers.\nThat reflected the \"considerable investments\" being made in the network and support for customers facing financial hardship, including through the social tariff that it offers qualifying customers, BT said.\nThe firm added that it already plans to switch to a new pricing model moving away from the old inflation-linked calculation \"in early summer\", before Ofcom's new ruling is implemented.\nOfcom expects its new rules to come into effect in the autumn.\nA spokesperson for Shell Energy Broadband said the firm had experienced \"the same inflationary cost pressures as everyone else\" resulting in the need for price rises. However 2024 price increase would be lower than their terms and conditions allowed for, they said.\nTalkTalk disputed Which?'s calculations. Three and Vodafone declined to comment when approached by Which?.",

    "Former Tory MP Nadine Dorries says she will return \u00c2\u00a316,876 in severance pay she mistakenly received for being a cabinet minister.\nGovernment accounts show she received the exit payout from her tenure as culture secretary under Boris Johnson.\nBut the rules say she should not have received it, because she had reached the age of 65 when she left office.\nMs Dorries said she only received an email about the admin error on Friday.\nSpeaking to BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the ex-minister said she would repay the money \"on Monday morning\".\nShe added that she was \"gutted\" to find out, joking that the mix-up \"means now everybody knows I'm not 49\".\nFormer ministers are entitled to receive a severance payment equivalent to three months of their annual ministerial salary when they leave office.\nBut only those who are younger than 65 when they leave their post, and are not reappointed as a minister for three weeks, are eligible for the money.\nMs Dorries left her role as culture secretary under former prime minister Mr Johnson in September 2022, around three months after she turned 65.\nHer erroneous exit payment was listed in her old department's latest set of annual accounts, but was first reported by the Times earlier this week.\nSeverance slip-ups\nIt is one of five exit payouts the government appears to have mistakenly made to former ministers aged 65 and over in the course of the last financial year.\nDepartmental accounts show Tory peer Baroness Stedman-Scott was paid \u00c2\u00a317,742 after leaving as a pensions minister in December 2022.\nFormer Tory MP Peter Bone, who was ousted by local voters as the MP for Wellingborough in December, was paid \u00c2\u00a35,593 for his three months as deputy Commons leader in 2022.\nFormer health minister Maggie Throup received the same amount, while former whip Sir David Evennett was paid \u00c2\u00a34,497.\nMs Throup told the BBC she has been in contact with the health department and is \"now waiting for further details as to how to repay\".\nOn Thursday, the Cabinet Office said relevant departments would be contacting those who erroneously received payments to recover them.\nSir David told the Times he had repaid the money he had mistakenly received after being alerted to the error this week.\nIt is understood that Baroness Stedman-Scott has contacted her old department about repaying her mistaken severance pay, and was unaware of the error until it was reported in the press.\nThe BBC has contacted Mr Bone for a comment.\nMs Dorries said there were \"no details\" in the email she received about how she could repay the money, but she was sure she would \"find out\".

    "The NHS should sell anonymised medical records to harness a new biotechnology \"industrial revolution\", Sir Tony Blair and Lord Hague have said.\nThe former Labour PM and ex Tory leader said the NHS' wealth of data could give the UK an advantage in new technologies shaping the future economy.\nSpeaking to the BBC, the former rivals said selling NHS data could help boost public services and research.\nThe NHS has repeatedly faced lawsuits over sharing data with tech firms.\nSir Tony and Lord Hague have jointly published a new report calling for \"a new national purpose\" focussed on harnessing a revolution in biotechnology and AI.\nSpeaking on BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, Sir Tony said: \"How do you achieve higher economic growth? Well, you're going to have to build the business sectors for the future. And this is bioscience, artificial intelligence.\"\nSir Tony added there was a unique \"opportunity in Britain with the NHS because it's a single payer system, and you have got data that is of immense value to creating your bioscience industry into and to letting it flourish\".\nThe NHS has already experimented with training AIs using NHS data.\nUniversity College London academics have developed an AI system that has the potential to predict heart attacks, stroke and Parkinson's disease in patients. The tool evolved from a 2016 collaboration between Moorfields Eye Hospital in London and Google company DeepMind.\nData could also be harnessed to help create personalised \"AI doctors\" for every person in Britain, according to the report published via the Tony Blair Institute.\nUltimately AI could monitor all NHS patients via smart watches and mobile phones, alerting doctors to issues, the report said.\n'Redesign government'\nPrevious NHS data-sharing schemes have provoked controversy.\nFollowing a court case, the Information Commissioner in 2017 said the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust did not adequately safeguard 1.6 million people's private medical records, accessed by Google's DeepMind.\nDeepMind insisted that the patient records were being used to help create a life-saving app, and the lawsuit brought by patients was eventually thrown out.\nMedia platform openDemocracy took the NHS to court in 2021 over a \u00c2\u00a323m contract with the firm US tech giant Palantir , known for supplying data-sifting software to government agencies.\nSir Tony and Lord Hague are campaigning for an overhaul of how the NHS handles data - giving patients more control over how their data is used.\nTheir joint report calls for the creation of an NHS Data Trust (NHSDT) - an arm's length body with a controlling stake owned by the NHS - to oversee and distribute anonymized NHS data for profit.\nGovernments will \"need the expertise of the private sector\" to make the most of the data, Lord Hague argued, and should be allowed to \"earn a return\" on their work.\nPeople already give away personal data through \"their mobile phone to many private companies, without particularly getting any benefit from it\", Lord Hague said.\nCreating a system where patients can \"control\" their personal data was \"actually a better way of thinking about it than the current chaotic system, where our own data ends up all over the world without us knowing where it's gone,\" he argued.\nAn overhaul of how government works may also be necessary, Lord Hague said.\nHe told the BBC: \"Unless you are at the forefront of this change and redesign government for these purposes, you are not going to be able to pursue it, you are just going to be stuck with low productivity.\"\nYou can listen to Political Thinking: The Blair and Hague One on BBC Sounds",

There are only statements by Russia, of a political and propagandist nature,\" he said. \"Who or what was on board needs to be clarified.\"\nMr Yusov, who is the first Ukrainian official interviewed by the BBC since the incident on Wednesday, accused Moscow of \"hiding\" information, with limited images from the crash site - including of any dead.\nRussia says 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war died when the IL-76 plane was shot down by a Ukrainian missile.\nIts investigative committee released a short video this evening, showing blood on the snow, plane wreckage and a large blackened area of ground.\nThere are some human body parts - but the footage and what it reveals is very limited.\nAsked whether it was possible Ukraine had shot down the military plane, Mr Yusov said: \"We do not confirm such information.\"\nHe said both sides were using drones that day over Belgorod: \"There were Ukrainian reconnaissance drones and Russia was launching attack drones.\"\n\"Russian air defence was working against them. Belgorod is also potentially within the range of Ukrainian air defence systems.\"\nWhen pushed, he said again there was \"no confirmed information\" that Ukraine had fired at the plane.\nHe also suggested that what he called a \"friendly fire\" incident by Russia - hitting its own plane - was \"one of the possible scenarios\" that needed looking into.\nMr Yusov said Ukraine had launched a criminal case on the plane incident that would look into all the possibilities.\nHe stressed the need for an international investigation, with full access to the crash site in Russia and any fragments of plane or any missile - \"in order to rule out all possibilities\".\nThe intelligence officer did claim that the specific Il-76 aircraft which crashed had been used previously to deliver ammunition and \"missiles for S-300 and S-400 systems\" to the Belgorod region.\nWe haven't been able to check that.\nBut such missiles are used in regular deadly strikes on Ukraine, particularly the Kharkiv region near the Russian border.

But it was meant to take place in the Sumy region, west of Belgorod.\nMr Yusov refuted Russia's claim that it had warned Ukraine its PoWs would be brought by military plane to the Belgorod region.\nHe said the two sides implemented a ceasefire in Sumy, as agreed. \"Unfortunately, the exchange did not happen.\"\nThe Ukrainian official said the two sides usually communicate about the routes they will use for prisoner swaps, to ensure safety.\nOn 3 January, during the previous swap, he said Ukraine was informed that Russia would use a plane.\nOn Thursday, Ukraine's Air Forces chief stressed that the country had the right to defend itself against attack by Russia and would continue to do so.",

    "A care home in Leicestershire has been judged to be unsafe for a second time.\nInspectors from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) raised the overall rating for Saffron House, in Barwell, near Hinckley, but found continued failings around safety.\nA report , released on Friday, said they found medication unattended, as well as issues with how staff cared for residents.\nThe home's owners said improvements would be made \"as soon as possible\".\nThe home was placed in special measures in July after residents were left sleeping on soiled mattresses and areas were found to be visibly dirty.\nThe CQC re-inspected the home in November and said improvements to cleanliness had been made between their visits, leading them to raise its overall rating from \"inadequate\" to \"requires improvement\".\nHowever, the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said it remained rated \"inadequate\" for safety.\n'Risk of choking'\nThe CQC report said that, during the latest visit, inspectors watched a member of staff leave the medicine trolley unobserved for nearly a minute, creating a risk that people at the home might be able to get their hands on drugs that were not theirs.\nA \"significant number of unidentified tablets\" had also been left in a container, which should have been used for the safe disposal of sharp objects, the CQC added.\nThe watchdog said there were gaps in medicine records but confirmed a manager had taken steps to improve medication management after the inspection.\nThe CQC also said the home, which cares for adults with physical disabilities and dementia, did not have a strategy to deal with a resident who was seen to be \"walking in and out of people's rooms without any support or intervention\".\nStaff said \"the person was agitated and better left alone,\" the CQC said.\nInspectors were also concerned a resident was left in distress and at risk of choking when he was being fed by staff and had to use their fingers to remove excess food from their mouth.\nA spokesman for Minster Care Group, which owns the home, said: \"We are disappointed that we have not yet achieved all of the improvements required by the CQC following its previous inspection.\n\"Significant progress has been made since then - which the CQC has acknowledged - but we have provided additional head office support for the team at the home and put in place an accelerated action plan to ensure all remaining quality improvements are implemented as quickly as possible.\n\"Ongoing staff training is being undertaken to ensure our processes and procedures are followed at all times and further refurbishment work on the building is under way.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "\"Pure evil\" is the headline on the front page of The Daily Mirror , which carries pictures of Brianna Ghey's teenage killers Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, after a judge ruled they could be publicly identified. The Daily Express' front page is similar - it calls them \"evil monsters\" and \"sadistic young killers\" .\nThe Guardian picks out a quote from the judge that the 16 year-olds were \"exceptionally brutal\" and adds that the Crown Prosecution Service said it was \"one of the most disturbing cases\" its lawyers had ever dealt with. The Daily Mail focuses on comments from the victim's mother, that Ratcliffe stabbed Brianna Ghey because he \"hated trans people\", and that Jenkinson did it \"for fun\" . The Daily Telegraph says Scarlett Jenkinson was obsessed with serial killers and a \"lust for fame\" that led to murder.\nThe Times leads on what it calls the \"outcry\" that the man wanted for an attack with a corrosive substance in London was given asylum , despite a conviction for sexual assault. Abdul Ezedi had claimed to have converted to Christianity, but people who knew him have told the paper he was a \"good Muslim\" who said he wanted to return to Afghanistan to find a wife, and who regularly shopped for halal meat.\nThe i leads on a poll which, it says, puts pressure on the Chancellor to cut income tax in the Spring Budget to ease the cost of living crisis. Its BMG Research survey of more than 1,500 people found the majority of voters believe they pay too much tax, with almost half wanting help for lower earners. The poll also suggests Labour's lead over the Conservatives has narrowed by two points to 15 per cent since November, but Sir Keir Starmer's personal ratings increased slightly.\nThe Royal Navy has abandoned major warship patrols around the Falkland Islands according to The Daily Telegraph. It says, despite an official policy to patrol the south Atlantic, no large British warship has visited the area for almost seven years due to shortages. The paper understands that the defence of the islands is now down to a small patrol vessel and four Typhoon fighter jets. It reports that Rishi Sunak is facing calls to review security after Argentina's new government announced a package of military spending. A Ministry of Defence source tells the paper it will always defend the Falkland Islanders' rights to self-determination.\nThe FT reports that the owner of Range Rover, JLR, is so worried about vehicle thefts it's been spending its own money on police operations at UK ports . The company's boss, Adrian Mardell, has called on the government to delay tax cuts and hire more police to stop stolen vehicles being taken abroad by criminal gangs. The FT says the business has been plagued by thefts of its luxury vehicles and has seen a huge rise in insurance costs.\nAnd The Daily Star's front page is devoted to new research about how much people spend to keep romance alive in a relationship.

    "A court has heard that Run-DMC star Jam Master Jay was shot dead more than two decades ago by his godson as revenge for being cut out of a drug deal.\nKarl Jordan Jr, 40, and another man, Ronald Washington, 59, have gone on trial in New York accused of murder.\nIn their opening statements on Monday, prosecutors claimed the pair carried out an \"execution\" that was \"motivated by greed and by revenge\".\nHowever, their lawyers told the jury they did not kill the pioneering DJ.\nJam Master Jay, real name Jason Mizell, was 37 when he was shot in the head at his recording studio in Queens, New York, in October 2002.\nHe was one third of Run-DMC, the influential hip-hop group known for 1980s tracks such as It's Tricky, It's Like That and Aerosmith collaboration Walk This Way.\nThey spoke against drug culture, even recording a \"Just Say No\" public service announcement in 1988. But prosecutors said Mizell had become involved as a middle man in cocaine deals to support his lifestyle and those of others close to him as the group's music career faded.\nThey said Mr Jordan, who was 18 at the time, and Mr Washington, a friend who was staying with Mizell's sister, thought they would be part of a deal worth nearly $200,000, and were angered when they were cut out.\nThey plotted to kill him after being \"left with nothing\", New York prosecutor Miranda Gonzalez told the jury, according to the Reuters news agency.\nAnother man, Jay Bryant, will face a separate trial in 2026. He is accused of entering the studio through the front door and letting Mr Jordan and Mr Washington in through a locked back fire exit, before Mr Jordan allegedly shot Mizell with a handgun.\n\"He would be murdered in his own music studio, by people he knew,\" Ms Gonzalez told the court, the AFP news agency reported.\n'No clue who did it'\nBut defence lawyer Ezra Spilke called the prosecution's account of events \"one version of many\", and said the accused pair \"have no clue who did it\".\nThere is no forensic evidence connecting his client, Mr Washington, to the murder, only \"ageing memories\", he said.\nMr Washington was an alcoholic and relied on Mizell to keep a roof over his head. \"Why bite the hand that feeds you?\" Mr Spilke said. \"Why kill the person you depend on?\"\nHe told the jury: \"Mizell was a beloved artist, but convicting the wrong person... does not solve the tragedy. It just adds another one to it.\"\nMr Jordan's lawyer John Diaz noted how \"the narrative has changed over time\" and that some prosecution witnesses had co-operated with federal investigators in exchange for leniency in their own criminal cases.\nThe trial is expected to last four weeks.",
    "Two teenagers have been found guilty of murdering an 18-year-old who was fatally stabbed in front of shoppers in a town centre.\nRaymond James Quigley, known as James, of Wymondham, Norfolk, was stabbed to death in Ipswich a year ago.\nJoshua Howell, 18, and Alfie Hammett, 19, both from the Ipswich area, were also found guilty of possession of an offensive weapon.\nNeither reacted as the verdicts were read out at Ipswich Crown Court.\nThe jury heard the attack, which took place in Westgate Street at about 15:30 GMT on 17 January last year, was gang-related.\nAddressing Hammett and Howell, Judge Martyn Levett said: \"The sentence I have to pass is mandatory detention for life.\"\nSentencing will not take place until 11 March while the court waits for reports.\nThe judge told Hammett: \"I'm so much in the dark about your background and the consequences.\"\nAddressing Howell, he said: \"The jury have rejected your account. I also think it's important I learn more about you.\"\nThe judge said the pair would be remanded in custody \"because there is a high propensity of you carrying a weapon\".\nHe warned them against choosing to not come to court for the sentencing.\nMr Quigley was attacked in the pedestrianised street, outside the former Debenhams building.\nHe ran into a card shop to seek help but died from stab wounds to his torso, back and chest.\nThe jury heard Hammett delivered the fatal blows while Howell threatened Mr Quigley's friends with a machete.\n'Gang links'\nThe prosecution said the victim was associated with a Norfolk gang known as Only The Money.\nThe court heard Hammett, of Larkhill Rise, Rushmere St Andrew, Suffolk, had links to another Norfolk gang called Third Side.\nHowell, of Wellington Street, Ipswich, had connections to the Nacton gang in east Ipswich, the jury was told.\nBefore the verdict was read out, Howell's mother waved at her son in the dock.\nShe had been supporting him throughout the trial, which started on 12 December.\nThe jury had been deliberating since Wednesday.\nThe prosecution alleged that the defendants were called on the day of the attack to work together to kill Mr Quigley.\nThe court heard that Hammett delivered the fatal blows.\nHowell told the court earlier that he had started selling cannabis in Ipswich a month before the killing, and had armed himself when strangers contacted him to meet up.\nHe said: \"As you've heard, I had incidents in the past and I kept the knife on me to make me feel safer - especially if I didn't know who I was meeting.\"\nThe jury heard from Lasharne Beaton who said she was with a friend in the nearby Starbucks when two people ran past.\n'He was still'\nReferring to Mr Quigley, she said: \"He went into the shop because he couldn't run any more, before bending over the counter and passing out backwards.\"\nHis top was \"completely saturated with blood\", she said.\n\"He stopped breathing and I tried to find a pulse. He was still. I started to panic and that's when I started to give him CPR.\"\nEarlier in the trial, the court heard Howell had transferred \u00c2\u00a31,000 to an account and bought a one-way plane ticket to Nairobi.\nThe prosecution said he did not have a phone when he was arrested four days after the stabbing, while Hammett had returned his to its factory settings.\nCCTV showed Howell held a machete and chased Mr Quigley's friend into a sports store, the court heard.\nProsecutor Andrew Jackson said Howell provided \"an intimidating presence\" and \"prevented Mr Quigley's friends from intervening to help\".\nAs Howell and Hammett were taken away, Howell's mother strained her neck to catch her son's eye but the blurred glass that separates the public gallery from the dock blocked her view.\nShe tutted and looked away.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A third of women in Sheffield miss vital checks to help prevent cervical cancer, a charity has warned.\nYorkshire Cancer Research said thousands of women invited for cervical screening each year had never attended an appointment, with the number missing free NHS tests increasing.\nScreening helps identify those at risk of developing cervical cancer, followed up with tests and treatment if needed.\nCervical cancer is \"almost completely preventable\", the charity said.\nChief Executive Dr Kathryn Scott said cervical screening may be awkward for some but it saved lives.\n\"It is vitally important that women come to their cervical screening when invited,\" she said.\n\"Screening helps detect changes in cells, so pre-cancerous cells can be treated before they have the chance to develop into cancer.\"\nMany women do not keep cervical screening invitations because of embarrassment, anxiety about the process or fear that it would hurt, the charity said.\nBut there were also practical reasons, such as whether they could book an appointment before or after work.\nThe charity said the age group most likely to miss screenings was 25 to 49-year-olds, who are invited for screenings every three years.\nWomen between 50 and 64 are invited every five years.\nTrans-men and non-binary people with a cervix are also eligible, it said.\nDr Scott said doctors knew attending screening could be daunting but \"the more people who attend their screening appointment, the more cancers that can be prevented and more lives will be saved\".\nShe said 25 to 29-year-olds would be given a tote bag for attending appointments, including a postcard to encourage friends and family to keep their appointments.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

    "Qatar has said it is \"appalled\" by remarks attributed to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he apparently called its role as a mediator in the Gaza war \"problematic\".\nIsraeli TV broadcast what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling the families of hostages held by Hamas that \"you don't hear me thanking Qatar\".\n\"They have leverage... because they finance [Hamas],\" he reportedly adds.\nQatar said the comments, if true, were \"irresponsible\" but \"not surprising\".\nThe tiny Gulf emirate has had high-level contacts with Israel since the 1990s, but they have never officially established diplomatic relations.\nQatar has long championed the Palestinian cause and hosts political leaders of Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and other countries.\nIt has also provided hundreds of millions of dollars of aid for Gaza, which has been subject to a crippling blockade by Israel and Egypt since 2006, when Hamas won legislative elections. The blockade was tightened the following year when Hamas reinforced its power in Gaza by violently ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) forces.\nSince 2018, Israeli governments have allowed Qatar to pay the wages of tens of thousands of civil servants in Gaza's Hamas-run government, financially support the poorest families, and fund fuel deliveries for the territory's sole power plant. Qatar insists the funding was only for civilian and humanitarian purposes.\nThe policy sparked controversy within Israel, with critics warning it was helping Hamas to stay in power and fund its military activities.\nMr Netanyahu - who has been re-elected to office for all but one of the past 15 years - said it was a way to dissuade attacks on Israel and prevent a humanitarian disaster in Gaza .\nFollowing the cross-border attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,300 people were killed and 250 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages, he dismissed as a \"big lie\" accusations that he had also encouraged the payments in order to strengthen Hamas at the expense of the PA.\nIsrael responded to the attacks by launching a large-scale military campaign in Gaza with the aim of destroying Hamas. More than 25,000 people have been killed in the fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nQatar used its ties with Hamas to help broker a week-long pause in the fighting in late November, during which 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed in exchange for some 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.\nThe emirate has for weeks been trying to broker a new ceasefire, with Gaza's humanitarian crisis worsening and with the Israeli government coming under mounting domestic pressure to secure the release of the remaining hostages.\nOn Tuesday, Israel's Channel 12 TV released what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling hostages' families: \"You don't hear me thanking Qatar. Have you noticed?\"\n\"Why? Because for me it is essentially no different from the UN or Red Cross, and in a certain sense is even more problematic - I have no illusions about them.\"\n\"But I'm ready to use any actor right now that helps me bring [the hostages] home,\" he added.\nIsrael has accused the UN and Red Cross of not doing enough to support the hostages or to help get them freed.\nThe prime minister purportedly said the reason Qatar could help was because of \"leverage\" over Hamas.\n\"Why do they have leverage? Because they finance them.\"\nOn Wednesday night, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari wrote on X , formerly Twitter: \"These remarks if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising.\"\n\"For months, and following a successful mediation last year that led to the release of more than 100 hostages, Qatar has been engaged in regular dialogue with the negotiating parties including Israeli institutions, attempting to establish the framework for a new hostage agreement and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\"\nHe added that Mr Netanyahu appeared to be undermining the mediation efforts \"for reasons that appear to serve his political career\".\nIn response, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X : \"Qatar is a country that supports and finances terrorism. It is Hamas's patron and is largely responsible for the massacre of Israeli citizens by Hamas.\"\n\"One thing is certain: Qatar will not have one iota of involvement in Gaza on the day after the war,\" he added.\nThere was no immediate comment from Qatar's foreign ministry.\nMeanwhile US President Biden is sending the director of the CIA to try to broker a new deal on hostages held in Gaza, the BBC's US partner CBS has confirmed.\nWilliam Burns will meet the Qatari PM and directors of Mossad, Israel's secret service, in France.",

    "Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been jailed for 14 years, the second sentence handed to Pakistan's former prime minister in two days.\nThe couple were convicted of illegally profiting from state gifts - just a week before a general election in which he is barred from standing.\nKhan, who was ousted as PM by his opponents in 2022, is already serving a three-year jail term for corruption.\nHe has said the numerous cases against him are politically motivated.\nWednesday's court case revolved around accusations over state gifts that he and his wife received while in office, while Tuesday's case - for which he was sentenced to 10 years - for leaking classified state documents. It is thought the two sentences will run concurrently, although that has not been confirmed.\nThe court has also ordered the couple to pay a fine of about 1.5 billion rupees (\u00c2\u00a34.2m; $5.3m).\nKhan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party also said that the sentencing further bans their leader from future political work: he will be disqualified for 10 years from holding public office.\nKhan's lawyers said they would be launching an appeal to Pakistan's High Court in both cases.\nThe former premier and international cricket star has been detained since last August when he was arrested , serving time mostly at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi.\nHis wife Bushra Bibi, who had been out on remand, surrendered at the jail on Wednesday.\nA government order late on Wednesday said she would be held under house arrest at her residence in Islamabad until further notice.\nBibi has typically kept a low profile during their period in office. The two married in 2018, months before Khan was elected prime minister.\nIn the so-called Toshakhana (state treasury) case, both had strongly denied the accusations brought against them by Pakistan's anti-corruption watchdog that they had sold or kept state gifts received in office for personal profit. Such gifts included a jewellery set from the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\nThe PTI  has described the cases against Khan as bogus, arguing the trials occurred under duress in \"kangaroo courts\", where proceedings have been rushed. His lawyers have said he was not given a chance to defend himself, while reporters at the court said neither Khan nor Bibi - nor their legal team - were in the room when the sentences were handed down.\nIt said Wednesday's case heralded \"another sad day in our judicial system history\", alleging the judiciary was being \"dismantled\" and that the decision was akin to \"a pre-determined process in play\". Pakistan's judiciary maintains it is independent.\nAccording to Dr Farzana Shaikh, an associate fellow at Chatham House's Asia-Pacific programme, the timing of the sentences could be read as the establishment ensuring \"there is absolutely no way Imran Khan can make it out in time for the election\".\n\"He has been in prison, but do remember the first of these sentences [was] imposed on him for corruption and a higher court actually suspended the sentence because it was seen to be full of holes,\" she told the BBC.\nBut it could also be an attempt to demoralise his supporters.\n\"That of course is a big gamble,\" Dr Shaikh added. \"It could galvanise his base and bring his supporters out in force.\"\nKhan himself told his followers on Tuesday to \"take revenge for every injustice with your vote on February 8 while remaining peaceful\" in a statement released on his X (formerly Twitter) account.\nEven before the latest sentences were handed down, many were already questioning the credibility of the election next Thursday given the extent to which Khan and his party have been sidelined.\nThe authorities deny carrying out a crackdown on PTI, but many of its leaders are now behind bars or have defected. Its candidates are standing as independents and many are on the run.\nThousands of the party's supporters were rounded up after protests - at times violent - when Khan was taken into custody last May. The party has also been stripped of its cricket bat symbol, essential in a country with low literacy rates to allow voters to choose where to mark their ballots.\nThe man tipped to win is three-time former PM Nawaz Sharif, who returned from self-imposed exile in the autumn. He was a thorn in the side of the powerful military for much of his long career and was jailed for corruption ahead of the 2018 election that Imran Khan won.\nNow many believe he is currently preferred by the Pakistan military establishment, while Khan - who used to be seen as close to the military - has fallen out of favour.\nAdditional reporting by Flora Drury in London",

    "The attorney general is considering whether judges should review the sentence of killer Valdo Calocane.\nCalocane, 32, killed Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates in Nottingham last June.\nThe attorney general's office has received a referral arguing the sentence was too lenient, after he was found guilty of manslaughter and given an indefinite hospital order.\nNHS England will also investigate his contact with mental health services.\nDuring the sentencing at Nottingham Crown Court on Thursday, Mr Justice Turner said Calocane would \"very probably\" be detained in a high-security hospital for the rest of his life, after he admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.\nThe families of those who died have expressed anger that Calocane was given a hospital order , with Mr Webber's mother saying \"true justice has not been served\".\nShe said the Crown Prosecution Service had, in November, presented her family with a \"fait accompli that the decision had been made to accept manslaughter charges\".\n\"At no point during the previous five and a half months were we given any indication that this could conclude in anything other than murder,\" she said.\nJanine McKinney, from the CPS, said the manslaughter plea was accepted on the basis of \"overwhelming\" expert medical evidence, \"namely that his actions were substantially impaired by psychosis resulting from paranoid schizophrenia\".\nIt said that after three psychiatrists \"agreed that a partial defence to murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility\" was available to Calocane, it took the \"unusual step\" of commissioning a fourth psychiatric expert to review the evidence, who also agreed.\n\"On the basis of this evidence, the CPS concluded that there was no realistic prospect of conviction for murder, so accepted the pleas,\" it said.\nIn his sentencing remarks, Mr Justice Turner said one of the psychiatrists reviewing the evidence had said that Calocane's mental illness \"will never be 'cured'\".\nGiven that Calocane's schizophrenia was resistant to treatment Mr Justice Turner said it was \"very likely\" that he would never be released.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, backed calls for an inquiry into any failings that led to the attacks.\nHe said he was \"very worried by what appear to be a number of points at which action could have been taken that would have prevented this happening\".\nHis comments came after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declined to back calls for a public inquiry, but promised to learn \"any lessons\" from the case.\nSir Robert Buckland, a former justice secretary, said better communication was needed with the victims' families, who said they were first made aware of a limited defence of diminished responsibility when a hearing took place in November.\nSir Robert said the prosecution had commissioned their own report before then, and described the lack of communication with the family as \"a matter of concern\".\n\"I think that everybody should be asking themselves whether or not the family should have been told earlier,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nAfter the sentencing, a spokesman for Attorney General Victoria Prentis confirmed her office had received a referral arguing the sentence administered had been unduly lenient.\nLaw officers now have 28 days to carry out a review and weigh up whether to refer the case to the Court of Appeal to decide whether the sentence was appropriate.\nUnder the Unduly Lenient Sentence Scheme, anyone can ask for a crown court sentence to be reviewed if they think it is too short.\nDuring the trial, the court heard Calocane had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. The Independent Mental Health Homicide Review will examine what lessons can be learned.\nAmong the questions the investigation is likely to examine is whether the killings could have been predicted or prevented.\nAt Calocane's sentencing hearing, it was revealed the former University of Nottingham student believed MI6 was spying on him.\nHe had been detained under the Mental Health Act at a psychiatric unit in Nottingham four times since May 2020 - the final time he was discharged was in February 2022, more than a year before the killings.\nHe was prescribed anti-psychotic medication but stopped taking it, which the prosecution said led to a further decline in his mental health.\nNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs mental health services in the county, said in a statement it had \"robustly\" reviewed its interactions with Calocane.\nChief executive Ifti Majid said \"there are many people who live with severe mental illness issues who do not offend and are supported to live well in the community\".\n\"If a patient no longer engages with our services and support and they do not meet criteria to be detained under the Mental Health Act, they are discharged back to the care of their GP and can be referred back into our services at any time,\" he said.\nSpeaking outside the court Emma We",

You are in denial and say you are not guilty.\"\nThe judge added after the trial, Khan shouted at the jury about corruption and spat at the judge from the dock.\n\"It demonstrated the mild-mannered man is an entirely different person when things are not going his way.\n\"Looking at the facts, the court is driven to the conclusion you are a dangerous offender.\n\"You pose a significant risk of causing serious harm to the public in future.\"\nKhan was also handed a restraining order to not contact the victim, was placed on the sex offenders register for life, barred from working with adults and children and ordered to pay a victim surcharge.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

When we have heavy rain like we've had recently, the sewage infrastructure can't cope.\n\"The obvious question is, didn't they invest to mitigate this over the last 30 years?\"\nIn his letter to Longparish councillors, Mr Gosden said the equipment was set up in January \"as part of testing our contingent readiness for an extreme emergency\".\nThe chief executive wrote: \"It will not happen again... You have my personal assurance that we will not be pumping into the River Test.\"\nHe said the firm had \"invested significantly\" to address the \"growing problem\" of groundwater overloading the sewerage system.\nHampshire had just experienced its wettest winter since records began in 1871, Mr Gosden added.\nOn its website, Southern Water said : \"We've listened to local councillors and other stakeholders and will not be installing overpumping to prevent homes flooding.\n\"Instead, we will rely on tankers to transport excess wastewater away to treatment works.\n\"We're sorry for the noise and disruption this 24-hour operation may cause.\"\nPreviously the firm said overpumping would involve \"transferring screened, filtered and settled, highly dilute wastewater\" to the watercourse.\nThe Test is an internationally renowned chalk stream, flowing 40 miles (64 km) from near Basingstoke to Southampton Water.\nThe stretch between Longparish and Chilbolton is part of a Site of Specific Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is famous for its trout and salmon fishing.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "Police in Washington state say an old rusted rocket found in a local man's garage is an inert nuclear missile.\nOn Wednesday, a military museum in Ohio called police in the city of Bellevue to report an offer of a rather unusual donation.\nThe police then sent a bomb squad to the potential donor's home.\n\"And we think it's gonna be a long, long time before we get another call like this again,\" police said referring to Elton John's iconic song Rocket Man.\nIn a press release, police say the device is \"in fact a Douglas AIR-2 Genie (previous designation MB-1), an unguided air-to-air rocket that is designed to carry a 1.5 kt W25 nuclear warhead\".\nHowever, there was no warhead attached, meaning there was never any danger to the community.\nBellevue Police Department spokesman Seth Tyler, told BBC News on Friday that the device was \"just basically a gas tank for rocket fuel\".\nHe called the event \"not serious at all\".\n\"In fact, our bomb squad member asked me why we were releasing a news release on a rusted piece of metal,\" he said.\nThe call to police came from the National Museum of the US Air Force near Dayton, Ohio.\nThe man, who does not wish to be identified and is \"extremely irritated\" by the media coverage, \"was not expecting a call from us\", Mr Tyler said, saying it seems the museum did not warn him they would be reporting his donation offer.\n\"He was gracious enough to let us have a look at it and we determined that it was safe,\" he said.\nOfficials never suspected that a nuclear warhead might be present, meaning there was no need for mass evacuations in the city of 150,000 people 10 miles (16km) east of Seattle.\nThe man told police that the rocket belonged to a neighbour who had died, and was originally purchased from an estate sale.\nPolice ultimately deemed the item an \"artefact with no explosive hazard\".\n\"Because the item was inert and the military did not request it back, police left the item with the neighbour to be restored for display in a museum.\"\nAccording to the Seattle Times , the rocket was used by the US and Canada during the Cold War.\nThe first and only live firing of the Genie rocket was in 1957, according to the newspaper, and production of it ended in 1962.",
    "More than 800 serving officials in the US and Europe have signed a statement warning that their own governments' policies on the Israel-Gaza war could amount to \"grave violations of international law\".\nThe \"transatlantic statement\", a copy of which was passed to the BBC, says their administrations risk being complicit in \"one of the worst human catastrophes of this century\" but that their expert advice has been sidelined.\nIt is the latest sign of significant levels of dissent within the governments of some of Israel's key Western allies.\nOne signatory to the statement, a US government official with more than 25 years' national security experience, told the BBC of the \"continued dismissal\" of their concerns.\n\"The voices of those who understand the region and the dynamics were not listened to,\" said the official.\n\"What's really different here is we're not failing to prevent something, we're actively complicit. That is fundamentally different from any other situation I can recall,\" added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe statement is signed by civil servants from the US, the EU and 11 European countries including the UK, France and Germany.\nIt says Israel has shown \"no boundaries\" in its military operations in Gaza, \"which has resulted in tens of thousands of preventable civilian deaths; and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the deliberate blocking of aid\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 putting thousands of civilians at risk of starvation and slow death.\"\n\"There is a plausible risk that our governments' policies are contributing to grave violations of international law, war crimes and even ethnic cleansing or genocide,\" it said.\nThe identities of those who signed or endorsed the statement have not been made public and the BBC has not seen a list of names, but understands that nearly half are officials who each have at least a decade of experience in government.\nOne retired US ambassador told the BBC that the coordination by dissenting civil servants in multiple governments was unprecedented.\n\"It's unique in my experience watching foreign policy in the last 40 years,\" said Robert Ford, a former American ambassador to Algeria and Syria.\nHe likened it to concerns within the US administration in 2003 over faulty intelligence leading up to the invasion of Iraq, but said this time many officials with reservations did not want to remain silent.\n\"[Then there were] people who knew better, who knew that intelligence was being cherry-picked, who knew that there wasn't a plan for the day after, but nobody said anything publicly. And that turned out to be a serious problem,\" he said.\n\"The problems with the Gaza war are so serious and the implications are so serious that they feel compelled to go public,\" he said.\nThe officials argue the current nature of their governments' military, political or diplomatic support for Israel \"without real conditions or accountability\" not only risks further Palestinian deaths, but also endangers the lives of hostages held by Hamas, as well as Israel's own security and regional stability.\n\"Israel's military operations have disregarded all important counterterrorism expertise gained since 9/11\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the [military] operation has not contributed to Israel's goal of defeating Hamas and has instead strengthened the appeal of Hamas, Hezbollah and other negative actors\".\nThe officials say they have expressed their professional concerns internally but have been \"overruled by political and ideological considerations\".\nOne senior British official who has endorsed the statement told the BBC of \"growing disquiet\" among civil servants.\nThe official referred to the fallout from last week's preliminary ruling by the UN's International Court of Justice in a case brought by South Africa which required Israel to do all it can to prevent acts of genocide.\n\"The dismissal of South Africa's case as 'unhelpful' by our Foreign Secretary puts [the international rules-based] order in peril.\"\n\"We have heard ministers dismiss allegations against the Israeli Government seemingly without having received proper and well-evidenced legal advice. Our current approach does not appear to be in the best interests of the UK, the region or the global order,\" said the official who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn response to the statement, the UK Foreign Office said it wanted to see an end to the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible.\n\"As the Foreign Secretary says, Israel has committed to act within international humanitarian law and has the ability to do so, but we are also deeply concerned about the impact on the civilian population in Gaza,\" said a spokesperson.\nThe European Union Commission said it was \"looking into\" the statement. The US State Department has been approached for comment.\nThe statement suggests that while Israel's military operation has caused unprecedented destruction of lives and property in Gaza, there appears to be no workable strategy to effectively remove Hamas as a threat, nor for a political solution to ensure Israel's security in the ",
    "Almost 15 years ago, when the UK was in the foothills of a prolonged period of near-zero interest rates, one of the top bosses at the Bank of England told me that savers might deal with low returns by eating into their financial nest eggs.\nAt that time the Bank was inundated with letters from angry savers, who could no longer live off the interest returns of their savings pots.\nNow, I hear, the opposite is true. The Bank's post room is full of correspondence from savers delighted at their bumper returns, following the rapid increase in interest rates to above 5%.\nNone of this should matter to where rates are now heading. But the decision-makers at the Bank of England know they are having to navigate some tricky waters with the public, politics and the financial markets over the coming year.\nThe big question of 2024 for the Bank is: when exactly will it start to cut rates? The first decision is on Thursday, and few expect there will be any changes from the current rate of 5.25%.\nThe crux of the situation is that the headline rate of inflation - the rate at which prices rise - may fall very rapidly, even below the 2% target by spring, alongside actual falls in domestic energy prices. But interest rates are not expected to fall so fast.\nThe Bank will be watching other measures of underlying inflation, such as core inflation which strips out the impact of food and energy prices.\nIt is yet to be convinced, in particular, that wages and prices have shaken off the period of above-average increases. Some economists argue that the Bank will wait until it gets firmer data on, for example, whether annual wage bargains remain well above 2% by the time of its May decision.\nThere will be a presentational difficulty in resisting rate cuts should inflation be well below 2%, and if the economy is not growing or even in a technical recession.\nThere will be business pressure for cuts, and in an election year there could be political pressure, if not from the government itself.\nThe Bank will have the opportunity on Thursday to explain more of its thinking than normal. It is releasing its quarterly assessment of the state of the UK economy, and forecasts for inflation.\nIt is also doing an annual assessment of the health of the supply side of the economy - the size of the workforce, the impact of supply chain challenges, and post-Brexit policy changes.\nThe Bank's record is also under review from a former head of the US central bank, Ben Bernanke. In addition, MPs are poring over its reversal of quantitative easing - the stimulus measure that the Bank originally introduced in 2009 to support the economy in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis.\nThe Bank will also have to consider some signs of resilience in the UK economy, for example in the housing market. The Bank can now anonymously track every single mortgage in the UK. Its understanding of how changes in interest rates affect consumer demand is far more sophisticated than in similar historic episodes, say in 1992.\nThe patterns of voting of the nine members of the committee who decide interests rates will be very interesting. In a volatile election year, where the sitting government would dearly love a series of rate cuts to underline a \"turning point\", it also faces one of the biggest tests of its independence.\nSo there won't be a rate cut this Thursday, but the Bank may shift away from existing language that rates could yet rise.\nHow are interest rates affecting you?

    "The UN's top court is to decide whether to issue emergency measures ordering Israel to halt its operations in Gaza.\nThe session of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Friday is part of a case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel is committing genocide.\nBoth countries testified when the case opened two weeks ago. Israel has vehemently rejected the allegation.\nA ruling against Israel is not enforceable by the court but would be politically significant.\nMore than 25,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed and tens of thousands injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, since Israel began its offensive, triggered by an unprecedented attack on Israel by the group.\nThe Hamas attack on 7 October killed about 1,300 people, mainly civilians. The attackers also took about 250 people back to Gaza as hostages.\nSouth Africa, which strongly supports the Palestinians, asked the court to issue nine provisional measures, including a halt to military activity by Israel, while it considers the accusation of genocide. A ruling on the latter is not expected for a long time, possibly years.\nIsrael reacted with outrage to the genocide allegation, accusing South Africa of distorting the truth. It said it had a right to defend itself and was targeting Hamas fighters, not Palestinian civilians.\nIt asked the judges to dismiss South Africa's request which it said was based on \"grossly distorted\" and baseless allegations of a non-existent genocide.\nIn reaching a ruling on Friday, the 17 judges - 15 permanent justices, plus one each from South Africa and Israel - must answer two questions:\nAlso, the judges are not limited to South Africa's specific requests. The panel could simply instruct Israel to ensure its actions comply with international law and to ensure that it does not do anything to impede deliveries of food, water or medicines.\nThe ICJ, though, only has the power to issue advisory opinions. And while its rulings are in theory legally binding, they are not enforceable by the court. If Friday's ruling go against Israel, it is almost certain to be ignored.\nIt would, however, place additional political pressure on Israel to work towards a ceasefire, and will intensify pressure on Israel's strongest international allies to do what they can behind the scenes to find a resolution and guarantee humanitarian assistance gets to where it is needed.",

    "New restrictions on XL bully dogs are being introduced in Scotland from 23 February.\nIt will be legal to own one of the dogs but they must be muzzled and on a lead in public from that date. Selling or exchanging them will be banned.\nAnd from 31 July it will be an offence to own an XL bully without an exemption certificate.\nThe regulations mirror those in England and Wales but certificates will be required there from Thursday.\nCommunity Safety Minister Siobhian Brown urged owners to prepare for the first stage of the new legislation coming into effect.\nShe said: \"These new rules are intended to prevent risks to public safety and animal welfare and keep our communities safe.\n\"The second stage of legal safeguards will provide owners seeking an exemption an appropriate length of time to decide how to prepare for the forthcoming change in the law ahead of the 31 July deadline.\"\nMs Brown added that the vast majority of dog owners were \"responsible animal lovers\".\nPenalties for breaching the new safeguards are up to six months imprisonment and or a fine up to \u00c2\u00a35,000.\nThe minister outlined the restrictions in a letter to Holyrood's criminal justice committee.\nDue to rising concerns over attacks and even deaths, the breed was initially banned by the UK government in England and Wales.\nThe Scottish government followed suit after an increasing number of the animals were being rehomed in the country from across the border, creating what First Minister Humza Yousaf described as a \"flow\" of the dogs.\nEarlier this month Mr Yousaf said the decision was made to \"ensure public safety\".\nBut the RSPCA has warned thousands of owners could breach new laws banning the dogs.\nJamie Greene, the Scottish Conservative MSP, said the SNP's \"failure to act swiftly\" had created an influx of the dogs in Scotland.\nHe added: \"The SNP were repeatedly warned of the consequences in delaying this sensible ban and unfortunately their embarrassing u-turn has come far later than it should have.\"\nOwners registering to keep their XL bully must comply with restrictions to ensure they are not a danger to the public, including being microchipped, kept on a lead, muzzled in public and neutered to ensure they cannot continue breeding.\nFurther details regarding what date applications for an exemption certificate will open in Scotland, how to apply and available support will be announced over the coming weeks.\nAre you an XL Bully owner worried about the deadline?

However, as the air mass then reaches the tops of the hills, it then descends and in doing so will dry out and subsequently warm by 1 degree Celsius per 100m.\n\"This results in higher temperatures being recorded on the downwind side compared with the windward side on the mountains.\"\nHe said southerly winds were also drawing up a very mild air mass across Scotland, leading to unusually warm conditions.\nThe village of Kinlochewe in Wester Ross lies at the head of Loch Maree. The area is known for its spectacular mountain views, especially the Torridon Hills.\nWhile enjoying mild temperatures the village was also subject to a yellow wind warn on Sunday, with gusts in excess of 40mph forecast.

    "Since its creation in 1918, the parliamentary seat of Rother Valley had always returned a Labour MP, but all that changed when the so-called red wall crumbled in 2019.\nWith another election due later in 2024, the BBC asked voters in the constituency whether time had changed their voting intentions.\nA rainy Monday night in South Yorkshire may not be where you expect to find the flame of rock 'n' roll burning brightly.\nBut the dancefloor of the Rotherham Titans rugby club bar is packed with couples attempting to preserve that fire.\nThey meet every week for a boogie to classic songs, but the twists aren't just restricted to the dance floor - politically, there's been a few about-turns too.\nRother Valley was a Labour heartland built on coal, but when two weeks before the 2019 general election Channel 4 reporters visited this very same dance club, the journalists were told Labour would not be their choice.\nAs the music whirled, one of those talking to a camera crew was Dave Smith, a former Labour Party member and Orgreave colliery union rep.\nIn short, he sounds like the least likely person to vote Conservative - but he turned blue and plumped for the Tories and Boris Johnson.\n'I feel adrift'\n\"I didn't vote Labour in the last election, I just did not like Corbyn at all, he wasn't good for the Labour Party and he certainly wasn't good for the country,\" he said.\n\"I'm almost 80 years old and it was the first time I've ever voted for the Conservatives.\n\"Brexit played a part as well.

No. We had Levelling Up and that's never happened, not to the degree that they said it was going to.\n\"I don't know how I'm going to vote in the next general election. I don't like Keir Starmer.\n\"The Conservatives have had many years in power and still not improved things.\n\"I feel adrift, I have no idea who to vote for.\"\nIn 2019, the Conservatives thought Rother Valley was unwinnable as the seat had been in the hands of Labour since its inception.\nBut Europe played heavily on the mind of Rotherham voters as 68% voted Leave, and their dislike of Jeremy Corbyn made them sway even further towards the Tories.\nThe Brexit Party, now Reform, received more than 12% of the vote, with the Lib Dems recording 5.2% of ballots cast.\nConservative candidate Alexander Stafford overturned a majority of just under 4,000 to canter to victory with 6,318 more votes than Labour in second.\nBoris Johnson rode into Downing Street on the crest of a wave after lifelong Labour supporters like Dave switched to the Conservatives.\nBut parts of the constituency are within the most deprived 6% of England and \u00c2\u00a312m of Levelling Up money for Dinnington high street has yet to translate into actual buildings.\nNow it's the Conservative voters who are unhappy.\n\"I've always voted Conservative but they've not delivered this time around, the country's in a bit of a mess\" said Rhoda Kitchen.\n\"All they seem to do is argue in Parliament and discuss things that don't matter to the country.\n\"I wanted to come out of Brexit but I didn't know enough about it, you tend to sometimes follow the crowd, don't you? I think we should have been told more about it.\n\"I know I'm not voting Conservative, I might have to study the others.\"\nPeter Thirlwall is a former councillor who has fallen in and out of love with the Labour Party over the years but is now firmly supporting them.\n\"Last time there was so many things at play,\" he said.\n\"There was Jeremy Corbyn who wasn't particularly popular and the alternative was Boris Johnson, who was a buffoon, then Brexit came into play so it was difficult, but I did finish up voting Labour.\n\"This time it's a lot simpler, all the personalities have gone. Things are substantially different, it's about policies, it's about competence and the Conservative Party have been in chaos for years.\n\"Brexit hasn't turned out to be the Shangri La that everybody thought it was going to be.

    "The Northern Ireland Housing Executive is increasing rents by almost 8% from the start of April 2024.\nThe Housing Executive, which is Northern Ireland's public housing authority, owns about 83,000 homes.\nAlmost 80% of tenants will be protected from the impact of the rent increase because they receive housing benefit or universal credit.\nTenants who are not on those benefits will face a 7.7% rise, meaning an average increase of \u00c2\u00a35.72 a week.\nThe increase is almost double the UK's rate of inflation which stood at 4% in December.\nPart of the reason for that is the Housing Executive uses September as its reference month for rent reviews when inflation was higher.\nLast year rents were increased by 7% , which at the time was below the rate of inflation.\nHousing Executive rents have also been frozen for five of the last eight years.\nChief Executive Housing Executive Grainia Long said rent increases were necessary to fund essential maintenance and an ongoing investment programme.\nShe said that the period of rent freezes had led to under-investment in the organisation's housing stock.\nThe rent rise is expected to increase Housing Executive income by \u00c2\u00a324m to \u00c2\u00a3345m.\nIt expects to spend about \u00c2\u00a3280m on maintenance and investment in the coming year, including around \u00c2\u00a345m on energy efficiency measures.\nNormally, a decision on Housing Executive rents would be taken by Stormont's communities minister.\nIn the absence of a minister, the decision was taken by the Department for Communities' senior official, under powers granted by the Executive Formation Act.",

    "Japan's Moon lander has resumed operations after being shut down for a week due to a power supply issue .\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) said it re-established contact with the lander on Sunday, indicating that the glitch had been fixed.\nIts solar cells are working again after a shift in lighting conditions allowed it to catch sunlight, the agency said.\nIt could not generate power when it landed on 20 January as the solar cells pointed away from the Sun.\nWith the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (Slim) spacecraft, Japan became only the fifth country to achieve a soft touchdown on the Moon after the US, the former Soviet Union, China and India.\nThe spacecraft ran on battery power for several hours before authorities decided to turn it off to allow for a possible recovery of electricity when the angle of sunlight changed.\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Jaxa shared a photograph taken by Slim of a nearby rock that it nicknamed a \"toy poodle\".\nThe lander will analyse the composition of rocks in its search for clues about the origin of the moon, Jaxa said.\nSlim landed at the edge of an equatorial crater known as Shioli, within 55m (180 ft) of its targeted touchdown location. Jaxa described it as an \"unprecedented pinpoint landing\".\nThe landing technology could allow future exploration of hilly Moon poles seen as a potential source of fuel, water and oxygen, the agency said.\nThe Slim mission came after earlier attempts by Japan failed, including one by the start-up iSpace, which saw its lunar lander crash when its onboard computer became confused about its altitude above the Moon.\nJaxa could not immediately say until when Slim will operate on the Moon. It has previously said the lander was not designed to survive a lunar night. A lunar night, which is when the surface of the Moon is not exposed to the Sun, lasts about 14 days.\nStatistically, it has proven very hard to land on the Moon. Only about half of all attempts have succeeded.\nPrior to Japan, India was the most recent nation to join the elite club of countries that have achieved this. Its Chandrayaan-3's rover touched down near the lunar south pole in August 2023 - an area on the Moon's surface that no human had reached before.\nEarlier this month, a US spacecraft launched by a private operator ended its lunar mission in flames over the Pacific.

A problem that Hitler saw clearly.\"\nHe went to describe the Nazi leader as \"the most slandered man\" and said he wanted to \"rehabilitate\" National Socialism.\nFor Reynouard it was argued that the videos did not threaten serious disturbance to the community and did not constitute a call to action and that to extradite him would be disproportionate.",

    "Serious concerns about maternity services at an NHS trust have been revealed by BBC Panorama.\nMidwives say a poor culture and staff shortages at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust have led to baby deaths that could have been avoided.\nA newborn baby died after the trust failed to take action against two staff, the BBC has been told.\nThe trust says it is sorry for its failings and is determined to learn when things go wrong.\nConcerns about two staff members, both midwives, had been raised by colleagues at the Cheltenham Birth Centre after another baby died 11 months earlier.\nThe birth centre allowed women with low-risk pregnancies the choice of giving birth there under the care of midwives - there were no emergency facilities in the centre.\nIn the event of complications, women should have been transferred to the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, which is part of the same trust and about a 30-minute drive away.\nBut on both occasions, the two midwives did not get their patients transferred quickly enough.\nJasper White died in July 2019 and Margot Bowtell died in May 2020.\nThe two midwives on duty for both deaths are now being investigated by their regulator, the Nursing and Midwifery Council.\nOne is suspended and the other has interim restrictions on her practice. We wrote to both midwives, but they did not respond.\nTen per cent of maternity units in England are now rated inadequate for safety by the Care Quality Commission, including at the Gloucestershire trust.\nMidwives are often reluctant to speak out, but BBC Panorama has been talking to former and current maternity staff at the Gloucestershire trust for more than a year.\nThey say the situation is \"desperate\", and a dangerous lack of staff was something they repeatedly raised with managers.\nBBC Panorama has also found:\nThe mothers of Margot and Jasper spoke to the BBC about the deaths of their babies.\nLaura Harvey and her partner Craig arrived at the Cheltenham Birth Centre in May 2020, excited and nervous at the prospect of meeting their first child.\nDuring the night while in labour, Laura had experienced two episodes of bleeding, but says she was reassured by the midwife looking after her that it was nothing to worry about.\nThe midwife didn't tell the next midwife on shift about the bleeding.\nAfter six hours in labour, Laura thought something could be wrong.\nShe twice asked for an ambulance to transfer her to the obstetrics unit at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. By lunchtime - on her third request - paramedics arrived.\nLaura remembers by then there was \"a bit of commotion in the room\" and they could not locate the baby's heart rate.\nShe says: \"I remember the midwife looking at me and the terror in her face filled me with terror.\"\nA third midwife, Michelle, a whistleblower who spoke to the BBC, was called into the room to help.\n\"I was beginning to get a real sick feeling in my stomach by this time that something was really, really wrong,\" she says.\nMichelle says when Margot was eventually born, she was white and not breathing.\nBaby Margot was then rushed to the neonatal unit at the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.\nHours later, the baby was taken to Bristol, 35 miles away, to receive more specialist care.\nThree days later, Margot's life support was removed. Her parents spent 90 minutes with their baby before she took her last breath.\n\"Then we drove home with an empty baby seat in the back of the car.\"\nAn independent investigation by the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) took place into Margot's death.\nIt found that the bleeding in labour meant Laura should have been transferred to the obstetrics unit at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital - and that if this had happened sooner it could have changed the outcome for her baby.\nEleven months earlier, the same two midwives who delivered Margot had also not called an ambulance soon enough for baby Jasper.\nJasper's health had deteriorated within minutes of being born at the Cheltenham Birth Centre, but his mother Laura White says the midwives did not seem concerned.\nOne of the midwives gave him air but Laura says she wasn't panicking and \"quite happily passed him back to me\".\nBut baby Jasper needed urgent medical attention and there was a 50-minute delay in transferring him to the neonatal unit in Gloucester.\nHe died just 11 hours after being born.\nMidwives under Pressure\nThe Care Quality Commission has said that maternity services at a trust in Gloucestershire are inadequate.\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or watch on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 29 January (20:30 in Northern Ireland and 22:40 in Wales)\nAn HSIB investigation into his death found a total delay of almost 90 minutes between him becoming unwell and arriving at the hospital. However, it could not be sure if the delay had contributed to his death.\n\"We got Jasper dressed in an outfit that we'd chosen to bring him home in,\" recalls Laura tearfully.\nThe whistleblower, midwife Michelle, says she had reported her concerns about the two midwives to ",

    "Washington now finds itself facing a dilemma.\nPresident Joe Biden has promised a strong response to Sunday's deadly attack on a US military base in Jordan . But the challenge for the US is to find the right balance between deterrence and escalation.\nFail to act decisively and it risks sending a message of weakness that will only encourage more attacks. Act too forcefully and it could trigger an escalatory response from Iran and its allies.\nSo what are the options? And how does this work?\nThe US will already have a number of \"on-the-shelf\" military options to choose from. These have been drawn up by the US Department of Defense with intelligence input from the CIA and the National Security Agency. They are then presented to the US National Security Council and policymakers, with the president making the final decision and signing off on the chosen course.\nOption 1: Strike Iran-allied bases and commanders\nThis is the most obvious choice and one that has been used in the past.\nThere are a large number of bases, weapons stores and training depots across Iraq and Syria belonging to the myriad of Iran-backed militias. These militias are trained, equipped and funded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, but not necessarily directed by them.\nThe US knows who they are and where they are. It could easily carry out more precision-guided missile strikes on these bases - but this has so far failed to deter the militias, who have launched more than 170 attacks on US bases in the region since 7 October.\nResponsibility for the attack has been claimed by a group calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq.\nThis is an umbrella term for a number of Iran-backed militias, some of which, ironically, have previously fought on the same side as the US against their common enemy in the region: Islamic State. They share common aims with Iran, namely to drive the US military from Iraq and Syria and to punish the US for its military support of Israel.\nOption 2: Strike Iran\nThis would be a massive escalation and not something the US would consider lightly.\nIt is highly unlikely, although not inconceivable, that the US retaliation would include hitting targets on Iranian sovereign territory.\nNeither Washington nor Tehran want to get into a full-scale war and both have said so. Iran's response could well include attempting to close the economically vital Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil and gas flow. This would have a devastating effect on world economies, driving up prices and almost certainly damaging President Biden's chances of re-election in November.\nOne alternative is to go after senior IRGC commanders in Iraq or Syria.\nThere is a precedent for this, the most notable being four years ago when then-President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed the IRGC Quds Force commander Qassim Suleimani in Baghdad in 2020. But this too would be seen as an escalation, and could well trigger a dangerous response from Tehran.\nOption 3: Don't respond\nThere are those in the US establishment who argue that, given the current tensions in the Middle East, it would be irresponsible for Washington to hit Iranian interests now, especially in an election year.\nCENTCOM, the part of the US Department of Defense that covers the Middle East, already has its hands full combatting the Houthis' attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. It will also be listening to pleas from US allies around the region not to trigger a wider Middle East conflict.\nBut this view is likely to be outweighed by those who say that the US policy of deterrence to date has failed, and that Washington's reluctance to hit back hard at those who attack its bases has only encouraged them to step up their attacks.\nThere is a time factor in all of this - some would argue that a radical uptick in US military responses may not be necessary or worthwhile in the long term.\nFirst, attacks by Iran-backed militias pre-date the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza - but they have dramatically increased since 7 October. Once Israel's assault on Gaza concludes then tensions in the region may well subside, although Israel warns this could still be months away.\nSecondly, there are loud calls by some in Washington for the US to decrease its military footprint in the Middle East. President Trump, when he was in office, had to be persuaded by his military and intelligence chiefs not to pull out all US forces from Syria, where they were helping Kurdish forces stop ISIS from returning.\nThere is a strong possibility that should Trump return to the White House in a year's time, then Iran will get its way anyhow, if he decides to draw down the US presence in Iraq and Syria.",
    "The family of a man paralysed after a scuffle outside a nightclub has agreed a \u00c2\u00a31.2m settlement with a police force whose officers lied about the incident.\nJulian Cole was taken to ground by officers outside Elements nightclub in Bedford on 6 May 2013.\nThe then 19-year-old had been trying to get back into the venue after being refused a refund when he was ejected.\nMr Cole, now 30, was left with a broken neck and damage to his spinal cord, which caused brain damage.\nHis family agreed an out-of-court deal with Bedfordshire Police, in which the force did not accept liability, and it has been approved at the High Court in London.\nMr Justice Martin Spencer said he had \"no hesitation whatever\" in approving the settlement.\n\"The matter was compounded by a concerted attempt on behalf of the police officers involved to falsify their account of events,\" he said.\nFirst-year University of Bedfordshire student Mr Cole had gone to the nightclub on the Sunday with friends, but was ejected through a side door in the early hours of Monday.\nWhen he was arrested he had been trying to get back into the venue after being refused a refund.\nIn 2018, a police misconduct hearing found three officers lied in their statements about Mr Cole's condition during his arrest.\nThey had claimed Mr Cole had been able to walk and get into the police van, but CCTV showed he had to be carried, with his legs dragging on the ground and head hanging down.\nThe officers were sacked for lying about what happened , but did not face criminal charges.\nMr Cole's mother, Claudia, wept during the High Court hearing, which she attended with his brother, Claude.\nAngus McCullough KC, representing the family, said the settlement represented \"a substantial top-up in terms of additional care, therapies and equipment\".\nThe judge said that a representative for the chief constable of Bedfordshire Police had \"expressed his regret and apology\" at a meeting in 2020.\nChief Constable Trevor Rodenhurst said: \"This case is an absolute tragedy which has had a devastating effect on a young man's life.\n\"While independent reviews have not been able to conclusively determine how he suffered his injuries, what is clear is that the actions of some of those attending fell well short of the standards I, and the public, expect.\n\"We have apologised to his [Mr Cole's] family for the conduct of the three officers who were rightly dismissed in 2018 for their dishonesty regarding Mr Cole's condition following his arrest.\n\"Our thoughts remain with Mr Cole and his loved ones.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "India's financial crimes agency has arrested a top opposition leader, hours after he resigned from the position of the chief minister of Jharkhand state.\nHemant Soren, of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) party, has been accused of corruption. He denies the allegations.\nHe was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday evening after seven hours of questioning.\nHis party has named transport minister Champai Soren as the next chief minister of the eastern state.\nMr Soren has challenged his arrest in India's Supreme Court, calling it politically motivated. The matter will be heard on Friday.\nHe is the latest in a long list of opposition leaders who are facing high-profile investigations led by India's central agencies.\nThe case against Mr Soren relates to a piece of land he allegedly owns in Ranchi city, the capital of Jharkhand.\nThe ED claims he bought the property through \"proceeds of crime\" by illegally selling land owned by the Indian army.\nMr Soren denies the charge and claims the property was \"wrongfully alleged to be owned\" by him.\nThe ED officials reportedly sent multiple summons to Mr Soren but he refused to appear for questioning.\nOn Monday, officials reached Mr Soren's residence in capital Delhi but found he was \"missing\". The agency said it seized 3.6m rupees ($43,381; \u00c2\u00a334,202) and a car from the house.\nA day later, Mr Soren surfaced in Ranchi and said he would record his statement before the agency on Wednesday.\nA curfew was imposed within a 100-metre radius of the chief minister's residence and the ED office in Ranchi on Wednesday evening.\nFew hours later, Mr Soren submitted his resignation, following which his loyalist Champai Soren was announced as the next chief minister. Hemant Soren was arrested later in the night.\nThe JMM has called the investigation against Mr Soren a politically motivated \"witch-hunt\".\nThe party accused the federal government, which is led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), of using central agencies to target opposition leaders ahead of the general elections. The BJP, meanwhile, denies allegations of political interference.\nIndia's main opposition Congress party also condemned Mr Soren's arrest, calling it a \"blow to federalism\". The JMM is a part of INDIA, the Congress-led coalition of opposition parties that is seeking to take on the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in the elections.\n\"The BJP, which is steeped in corruption, is running a campaign to destroy democracy,\" Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\nSeveral other chief ministers and opposition leaders are facing corruption allegations.\nIn November, the ED had summoned Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in connection with a case related to a now-scrapped liquor policy in the state. His party leaders Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh have already been arrested in the case.\nThe ED is also investigating money laundering allegations against the chief ministers of three southern states - Telangana, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. All the leaders have denied the charges against them.\nRead more India stories from the BBC:",
    "A walker has been stretchered to safety after spraining their ankle near a well-known Peak District site.\nGlossop Mountain Rescue Team and two paramedics went to help the walker near the Bleaklow Bomber site in Derbyshire at about 13:15 GMT on Saturday.\nThey were carried about two miles (3km) to the A57 before going to hospital.\nAt the same time, a second mountain rescue team went to two walkers who needed help on the Kinder Scout path, about eight miles (13km) to the south.\nA Kinder Mountain Rescue Team representative said they were called out at about 14:30 to the pair, who had been following a route which took them up Red Brook on to the Kinder Edge path, but had \"reached a point where they couldn't go up or down\".\nThey said one of them had aggravated a knee injury and he was \"struggling to walk\".\n\"We deployed Kinder 1 to assess the walkers and their situation, while the rest of the team prepared the rope rescue equipment,\" they said.\nHowever, they said a passing group, who were scrambling up Red Brook, came across the pair and helped them to a path using their rope.\nThey added that the injured man was given pain relief and both were \"escorted on an easy route\" back to Edale Cross, before being given a lift back to their vehicle at Bowden Bridge.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has presented its last budget before the country heads for general elections in the coming months.\nThe interim budget - or a stop-gap financial plan - will come into effect from 1 April until a new government presents a full-fledged budget after coming to power.\nNot surprisingly, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has continued to fund infrastructure building - which has been a major driver of India's economic growth. Over $130b has been allocated to build physical assets like roads and ports this year - a 11% jump from last year - but below the nearly three-fold trendline annual increases India has been seeing since 2019.\nMs Sitharaman said the government would build 20 million affordable houses in the next five years in addition to the nearly 30 million houses built already.\n\"This will provide obvious impetus to the rural economy both in terms of job creation and construction, while also fulfilling the government's socio-economic agenda,\" said Shubhada Rao, an economist and founder of QuantEco Research.\nHigh public spending is expected to help keep India's GDP growth at about 7%. The rapid expansion has allowed the government to collect higher taxes, and curb its fiscal deficit - the gap between what it earns and spends - by half a percent to 5.1% this year.\nThis would mean lower market borrowings, which has led to a rally in India's bond markets. \"The finance minister has laid the path for a 4.5% fiscal deficit target by 2026,\" Ms Rao said.\nThere were no new tax relief measures announced for the salaried middle class and Mr Modi's pre-election spending plan also refrained from announcing big increases in social schemes - barring a programme to provide free electricity through rooftop solar projects to 10 million households - to lure voters.\nIndia has already extended a free food programme, which was implemented during Covid-19, for the next five years to 800 million people.\nThe ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is widely expected to retain power going by its wins in three provincial elections last year and Mr Modi's high popularity ratings.\nWhile this has reduced the government's populist impulse, criticism over inadequate spending on health and education has been mounting.\nAlongside an emphasis on building physical capital, there has not been enough attention paid to creating \"human capital\" in India, Dr Raghuram Rajan, the former governor of India's central bank RBI, told the BBC. This was a worry given India's unemployment crisis.\n\"We are flying blind\" without credible data on jobs, Dr Rajan added. He also said malnutrition levels in parts of India are higher than many countries in sub-Saharan Africa which was \"unacceptable\" for an economy that was outpacing most others.\nEconomists have also expressed concern about private investment not picking up pace, and India's consumption story painting a picture of uneven growth - with the urban rich getting richer and buying more premium products, while those at the bottom of the pyramid in the rural hinterland continuing to cutback on spending.\nRead more India stories from the BBC:",
    "\"I've always wanted to tap dance, and in my dotage perhaps it's something I could take up,\" said Queen Camilla, when she met Johannes Radebe from the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing show.\nThe dancer gave the Queen a pair of tap shoes on a visit to Cambridge.\nThe Queen and the Strictly star attended a community centre which holds dance classes for beginners.\n\"We all watch it.

I thought when that happened: this isn't bad.\"\n'A truly remarkable contribution'\nThe university's president and vice-chancellor, Prof Sir Ian Greer, said both men had made a truly remarkable contribution to journalism for more than 40 years.\n\"Ken and Stephen will be the first recipients from their profession to receive the Queen's University Chancellor Medals and I can think of no more deserving individuals to break this new ground,\" he said.\n\"The Troubles saw some world-class journalism emanate from [Northern Ireland] and they provided a vital public service during the dark days of fear and uncertainty.\"\nMr Grimason, originally from Lurgan, Co Armagh, and Mr Reid, who is from Belfast, first met while working as young journalists at former newspaper the Belfast News.\nThey continued to work as colleagues at the News Letter before working as political correspondents at BBC Northern Ireland and UTV.\nRecently both men have spoken of their battles with cancer.",

    "In an exhibition hall opposite the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin walks onto a stage.\nThere's rapturous applause, a standing ovation.\nNo surprise there. The invited guests - many of them Russian celebrities - are officially supporting Mr Putin's candidacy in the presidential election in March.\nThe Kremlin leader is running for a fifth term in office. The audience here is only too pleased.\n\"[Putin's] an extraordinary leader, the most courageous and wise person,\" gushes filmmaker Andrei Konchalovsky.\n\"The Russian people have never been so united in their support for their president,\" claims singer Nadezhda Babkina. \"And anyone who tries to prevent that will fail.\"\nThe idea behind the event (and this high-profile celebrity support) seems to be to show that candidate Putin is in a league of his own: Premier League Putin.\nKeep in mind, though: this is a league he created and of which he's in charge. Russia's political system is Mr Putin's political system; his rules of the game; his election. Mr Putin's most vocal critics have long been relegated. They're either in exile or in prison.\nWhich makes elections here rather predictable.\nThat wasn't always the case.\nThirty years ago in Moscow I remember watching one of Russian TV's first ever election night results programmes - it was for a parliamentary election. No-one had a clue who was going to win.\nI'll never forget the astrologer they had on to make a political forecast. Quite appropriate really, because three decades ago, Russians had stars in their eyes about democracy, freedom, and their country's future.\nFor a Russian election today you don't need astrologers or crystal balls. I can tell you now how the 2024 presidential election will end: with a Vladimir Putin landslide.\nThe reasons for such confidence?\nFirst, although his will not be the only name on the ballot, Mr Putin's challengers will not include arch-rivals like jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Putin v Navalny? Matches like that just aren't allowed to happen in the Putin Premier League.\nTrue, another Kremlin critic, Boris Nadezhdin, is pushing to be on the ballot. But Mr Nadezhdin is not Mr Navalny. He carefully calibrates his criticisms of Mr Putin. He's also believed to have connections within the presidential administration.\nIf he does end up running, it will be because the Kremlin has decided it's in Mr Putin's interests to face a more critical challenger.\nSecond, in Russia the Kremlin controls television. Mr Putin receives vast amounts of airtime during which he's much praised and rarely criticised: handy when you're seeking re-election.\nAnd there's another reason Mr Putin will do well.\n\"We all support your decision to run in the election. Because you've been in power as long as I can remember,\" said Alexander, a young Russian TV reporter at Mr Putin's end of year press conference.\nI've met many Russians like Alexander who cannot imagine anyone else in the Kremlin. Not because they idolise Mr Putin. They just see no alternative.\nI've often heard people say: \"Well, if not Putin, who then?\"\nThe Kremlin has engineered that. It has cleared the political landscape removing any potential challengers to the man who has ruled Russia, as president or prime minister, for nearly a quarter of a century. By doing so, it has ensured that little question - \"who then?\" - is left unanswered.\nWhen I talk to people in the town of Rzhev, 140 miles (225km) from Moscow, about their hopes for the election, many seem to want change - without changing the leader.\n\"I hope things change for the better because there's stagnation now,\" says a young man called Ilya. \"But if you elect someone new, that person might not cope with the burden of government. Someone experienced like Putin can develop the country even in the difficult situation we're in now.\"\n\"I have big hopes for the election,\" says pensioner Lidiya. \"I hope that the war will end and the economy will improve. But I do respect Putin.\"\n\"Is there no-one else who could do his job?\" I ask.\n\"Not right now,\" Lidiya replies. \"Maybe Putin will find someone later. But I think he'll be in power for a long time to come.\"\nEven the war in Ukraine and significant Russian military losses don't appear to have sparked widespread disillusionment in Russia's president and Commander-in-Chief.\nIt was Mr Putin's decision to launch the full-scale invasion. But some Russians believe that at a time of war it is their duty to back their leader, without questioning his motives or the consequences. Others accept the official narrative/alternative reality that it's the West, not Russia, that started the war.\nI meet one woman in Rzhev who does want to see change in the Kremlin. Former TV journalist and regional legislator Yekaterina Duntsova recently tried to run for president herself. She called for peace in Ukraine, the release of political prisoners and a \"humane\" Russia.\nRussia's Central Election Commission refused to accept her nomination, citing errors in her paperwork.\n\"I think the poli",
    "On a cold Saturday night in January more than 1,000 people descended on one of Manchester's most well-known music venues, the historic Ritz.\nIt's hosted big names from The Beatles and the Smiths to the Arctic Monkeys and Kendrick Lamar.\nBut on this night, the bands were not playing their own songs - they were all tribute acts.\nWhile the tributes to well-known names can become household names in their own right, these acts are slightly more niche.\nThe evening is celebrating emo featuring Fell Out Boy (Fall Out Boy) and The Black Charade (My Chemical Romance).\nBut what is the draw of tribute bands - for both the fans and the performers?\nQueuing before the doors open are Shane Tomlinson, Tim Jones and Tim's son McKenzie.\n\"We're all fans of My Chem so we thought why not come down,\" 19-year-old McKenzie said.\n\"It was only \u00c2\u00a325, so why not?\", Shane added.\nTim said: \"[It's the] next best thing to the real thing.\"\nKirsty Finch and Zani Bibey met Elena Turpin in the queue, Elena said she regularly travels to see The Black Charade from Bangor.\n\"We used to listen to these songs in school and we were like 'let's go relive our youth',\" Zani said.\n\"I'm a big My Chemical Romance fan, so it's really cool to see people re-enact their songs,\" Elena added.\nBackstage, The Black Charade are getting their costumes ready.\n\"I feel like if you're going to be a tribute band you've got to look, sound the part,\" singer Chris Greenslade said.\n\"You've got to go all out or otherwise you're just another cover band that should be playing in a pub.\"\nBassist Nick Hughes described playing in a tribute as being the \"the living jukebox of a party that you and everyone else wants to go to\".\n\"It's a nice way of being the centre of attention and a big singalong,\" he said.\nThe band's members are based in London, Bristol and Derby and work it around their day jobs with Nick, for example, an IT technician, and Chris a laser tag technician.\n\"We're boring, 40 year old office job guys,\" laughed Chris.\nThe Ritz has links to the New Jersey band as singer Gerard Way performed at the venue on a solo tour.\n\"There's a couple of venues we've played that the band played and every time it feels surreal,\" Chris said.\nHe added it was \"entirely probable\" My Chemical Romance knew about them.\n\"They probably know we exist by now and so far we haven't had a cease and desist!\"\nFell Out Boy have been playing shows with the Black Charade for the last few years.\n\"We've found when we put two bands together, we can start scaling it to much bigger venues,\" explained singer Bertie Scott.\nGuitarist Scott Baker described it as \"a hobby that went a bit too far\".\nThey formed in 2013 in Southend, originally for one night and they credit it with helping them develop as musicians.\n\"It's an amazing way to learn how to be a band,\" said Bertie.\nThe band have a mix of day jobs from 9-to-5s to music industry roles, with Bertie a songwriter and producer.\nFor Fell Out Boy, the band they impersonate do know they exist and give them tickets to UK shows.\n\"We should probably open for them at some point, playing what they're not going to play,\" said bassist Dan Philpot.\nThey have seen changes in the tribute industry.\n\"To start with, I was just having a great time playing Fall Out Boy songs but I knew nothing about the tribute scene,\" said Scott.\n\"We started playing festivals and it was 8,000, 10,000 people, it was unbelievable.\n\"It was a whole new world I didn't know about.\n\"Now's the time of the tribute band, the tribute band scene is doing very, very well,\" added drummer Antony Yates.\nPaul Winteridge is the president of the Entertainment Agents' Association and said tribute bands \"contribute to the vibrancy\" of the industry.\nHe said there was a growing number of bands from those with a \"niche market\" to \"iconic\" bands and price can be key.\n\"We've got to look at the cost of living,\" he said.\n\"People can't always afford the price for the originals so it's a way for them to enjoy the music for less.\"\nBack at the Ritz, Fell Out Boy take to the stage with an energetic showcase of Fall Out Boy's back catalogue, ending with a rousing performance of Sugar, We're Goin Down.\nA hi-octane performance from the Black Charade followed, with costume changes and dancers as they perform some of My Chemical Romance's best known tracks.\nAfterwards, fans wait to get pictures with Chris while others file out into the cold Manchester night talking about the evening.\nThey might not be the real thing, but for many here, they are the next best thing.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Meta has said it will launch a new safety tool to block children from receiving and discourage them from sending nude images, including in encrypted chats later this year.\nThe tool is likely to be optional and available to adults too on Instagram and Facebook.\nIt follows criticism from government and police after Meta started to encrypt Messenger chats by default.\nThey say encryption will make it harder for the firm to detect child abuse.\nAccording to Meta the new feature is solely designed to protect users, particularly women and teenagers - under-13s are not allowed to use its platforms -  from being sent nude images or being pressured into sending them.\nIt also announced that minors would, by default, be unable to receive messages on Instagram and Messenger from strangers.\nEarlier this month, police chiefs said youngsters sending nude images contributed to a rise in sexual offences committed by children in England and Wales.\nAnd legal filings recently made public as part of a US lawsuit against Meta, allege company documents show an estimated 100,000 teenage users of Facebook and Instagram are sexually harassed online every day. Meta has accused the lawsuit of mischaracterising its work.\nBut on Thursday the tech-giant revealed a planned new feature to help protect teenagers from inappropriate images in their messages.\nThis system will also work in encrypted chats with more details to be revealed later this year.\nMeta's recent decision to protect Facebook Messenger chats by default with end-to-end encryption (e2ee) has been fiercely criticised by government , police and leading children's charities.\nE2ee means only sender and recipient can read messages meaning, critics say, Meta cannot spot and report child abuse material in messages.\nOther messaging apps such as Apple's iMessage, Signal and Meta-owned already WhatsApp use the tech and have strongly defended the technology .\nHowever, some critics say platforms should deploy a technique called client-side scanning to detect child abuse being sent via encrypted apps.\nClient-side scanning refers to systems on a user's device that scan messages for matches with known child abuse images before they are encrypted and sent, and report any that contain suspected illegal content to the company.\nChildren's charity the NSPCC has suggested Meta's new system \"shows that compromises that balance the safety and privacy rights of users in end-to-end encrypted environments are possible\".\nAccording to Meta its new feature is not client-side scanning, which it believes undermines the chief privacy protecting feature of encryption, that only the sender and recipient know about the contents of messages.\nIt will use machine learning only to identify nudity and will work entirely on device, the BBC understands.  According to Meta, using machine learning to identify child abuse is much harder and there would be a serious risk of errors if this was attempted across its billions of users with the potential of innocent people being reported with grave consequences..\nInstead a range of systems are used to protect children, which according to Meta do not undermine privacy including:\nNew tools\nMeta argues it has introduced over 30 tools and resources to help keep children safe and on Thursday it also revealed a number of new child safety features.\nBy default children will be unable to receive messages on Instagram or Facebook Messenger from people they do not follow or are not connected to, it announced.\nMeta policy already stops adults from messaging teenagers who do not follow them.\n\"Under this new default setting, teens can only be messaged or added to group chats by people they already follow or are connected\", Meta blogged.\nThe parental supervision tools will now also give parents the ability to deny a teenagers' requests to change their default safety settings - such as who can direct message them or whether they can view more sensitive content.

    "A police force spent more than \u00c2\u00a31m dealing with protests outside a hotel which was set to house more than 200 asylum seekers.\nThe protests outside Stradey Park Hotel in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, started in early July last year.\nFires broke out near the site and about 40 arrests were made between mid August and early October.\nThe Home Office scrapped the controversial plans in October .\nFollowing a Freedom of Information request by BBC Wales to Dyfed-Powys Police, the Police and Crime Commissioner in the area said the situation had cost the force money and its good relationship with the local community.\nDafydd Llywelyn said he wrote to the Home Office at the time, calling for the plans to be reversed as \"a matter of urgency\".\nThe Home Office said it had confirmed a police funding settlement with Dyfed-Powys Police.\nThe hotel in Llanelli was set to house up to 241 people as part of UK government plans to reduce asylum costs.\nConcerns over suitability and lack of information were raised by local people, the local authority and politicians.\nAfter the announcement was made, crowds gathered outside the hotel and a makeshift base for protesters was set up.\nLabour councillor Martyn Palfreman said it was \"an episode in the history of the area that nobody really anticipated\".\n\"It was a litany, really of tension, of understandable anxiety\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a really intense time,\" he added.\nIn October, Dyfed-Powys Police's Supt Ross Evans said the behaviour \"of some individuals has gone far beyond what we would expect from a lawful protest\".\nMr Llywelyn previously said he would ask for a \u00c2\u00a3300,000 reimbursement for policing costs of the protest.\nThe new figure of more than \u00c2\u00a31,165,000 shows that the total cost for the force is three times what was expected.\nMr Llywelyn said he was not shocked by the final figure, adding there were \"several operational and organisational pressures that have impacted in the current financial year\", including Operation Cambrian, which covered the response to the Stradey Park Hotel protests.\nHe said he wrote \"several letters\" to the home secretary at the time of the protests, urging the government to reconsider its use of the hotel as \"tensions around the site had been growing on a daily basis for weeks\".\n\"How much did the Home Office themselves spend on the site? I have asked the home secretary to provide a clear explanation for the position we found ourselves in, and the significant pressure which were being placed on local service providers in Carmarthenshire and beyond,\" he said.\nDame Nia Griffith, Labour MP for Llanelli, said the plans had been \"a disaster from start to finish\" and \"were brought about by incompetence, mismanagement and a damaging lack of respect for local people\".\n\"The fact they spent over a million pounds on policing something completely unwanted and wholly unnecessary is a scandal,\" she said.\n\"That money could and should have been spent on frontline policing in the area, making our streets and communities safer, not on propping up a failing, misguided idea dreamt up by out of touch, arrogant ministers.\"\n'Lessons will be learned'\nFormer racial equality commissioner Aled Edwards said there were lessons to be learned.\n\"The force has integrity, it did its job,\" he said.\n\"Lessons will be learned, they always are in these instances.\n\"We've got to remember here in Wales we've got a good model with the Afghan scheme, the Ukranian scheme, both of those schemes have worked very well.\"\nA Home Office spokesperson said the government was \"making significant progress with moving asylum seekers out of hotels\", which cost UK taxpayers \u00c2\u00a38.2m a day.\n\"We are committed to ensuring the police have the tools they need to public safe and have confirmed a total police funding settlement of up to \u00c2\u00a318.4bn in 2024-25 - including up to \u00c2\u00a3148.0m for Dyfed-Powys Police,\" they said.\n\"Decisions about how funding and resources are utilised is a matter for individual police and crime commissioners.\"\nAdditional reporting by Elen Davies and Peter Gillibrand.",

It is justice.\"\nWhat was historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland?\nMr McGuinness's case is the latest to emerge from abuse carried out at children's homes in Northern Ireland.\nThe Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) Inquiry studied allegations of abuse in 22 homes and other residential institutions between 1922 to 1995.\nThese were facilities run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children's charity Barnardo's.\nThe public inquiry, led by the late Sir Anthony Hart, found that there was widespread abuse and mistreatment of young residents across the institutions.",

The name means \"nervous, excitable or flurried\" in Orcadian dialect and their mission as well as making energetic Scottish roots music was to promote gender diversity.\nIn 2021 they released their self-titled debut album, which was entirely created, produced and promoted by women. But having struggled to find engineers, producers and videographers, they decided to set up their own mentoring programme ahead of their second album.\nBetween March and November last year, they offered six female or non binary applicants the chance to be mentored in studio recording, marketing, sound production, business and instrumental. The scheme has the support of Creative Scotland.\nMusic student Amber Blake was one of their first mentees.\n\"I saw them at the Skye Live festival a couple of years ago and thought they were just so amazing,\" she says.\n\"And the energy that they have on stage is unreal.\"\nShe's been working with Heisk's newest member Isla Callister, a fiddle player from the Isle of Man.\n\"We've covered, so much and I've learned so much\" says Amber.\n\"We've done composition. I've written a few tunes and we wrote a wee tune together which was so amazing, to be working with Isla Callister.\"\nIsla, who came to Scotland to study at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, plays in another band in which she's the only woman but she says it's her role in the all woman line-up which attracts most attention.\n\"We're not alone on the scene\", she says.\n\"There's the fantastic Kinnaris Quintet, the Shee, and of course the Poozies, who have always been an inspiration.\"\n\"But you do get people coming up to us after gigs and saying they've never seen a band that big - six piece and all of them women.\"\n\"It's not just about female empowerment. Gender diversity is important to us and that can look like many different things.\"\nCatrina was involved in establishing the Bit Collective, a campaign and support group addressing inequality in the traditional music sector.\nAccording to research carried out last year, only 33% of performers at folk festivals in Scotland last year were women.\n\"It's not just the traditional music scene which has these issues,\" she says.\n\"It's right across the music industry. So I think it's possible that some of our mentees will go on to work across the music industry in Scotland which is exciting.\"\n\"We're really lucky in that the traditional music scene is so small and quite supportive so we are really able to make big changes in a reasonable timeframe. In the six years we've been together as a band, there's been a real change. There have been so many more women in line-ups and on the scene.\"\nFor a band born out of this festival, it's always going to be an important place. This year, as well as launching their new album, Heisk are performing a number of gigs including an education concert for hundreds of nursery and primary school children.\n\"I think the thought of two thousand young people being able to just come and see folk having fun on stage will hopefully be a big inspiration,\" says Catriona.\n\"It may encourage them to get into music but might also just normalise the idea of having women having a nice time on stage playing loud music with sequins and glitter.\"\n\"And everyone's welcome. You don't have to be a woman to come along and enjoy our music.\"\nHeadstrong, the new album by Heisk is out now via The Bothy Society.",
    "A man who fled the Nazis on the last peacetime boat to leave Germany for England, when he was three, has said he owes his life to an embassy official.\nDanny Herman, who now lives in Greater Manchester, said he arrived in England a day before World War Two started.\nMr Herman, who lost more than 20 Jewish relatives in the Holocaust, said his mother's passport was stamped with one of the last visas issued.\nHe said the Holocaust should never be forgotten.\n\"We don't want it to be confined to one line in history - so that it doesn't happen again,\" he said.\nMr Herman, who is originally from Konigsberg, East Prussia, and now lives in Bowdon, told BBC North West Tonight he often thought of the members of his family who died.\nNow 88, he said this included his grandparents.\n\"They ended up in Sobibor,\" he said. \"It was an extermination camp rather than a concentration camp.\"\nHe said his aunt and uncle were also killed.\nThey \"perished\" in the Auschwitz labour camp, he said.\nUnwilling to leave his family, Mr Herman's father stayed but only avoided capture by hiding from the soldiers upstairs.\nMr Herman said his father, who was originally from Germany, escaped to England the next day after the organisation he volunteered for told him the soldiers were going to come again for him and take him away to a concentration camp.\nHis mother resolved to follow him, too, but having already sent off for a visa, her passport was inside the British Embassy in Berlin.\nHe and his mother set off for Berlin, which he said was an 800-mile trip.\n\"She had a friend in Berlin so we stayed with the friend and first thing the next morning she went to the embassy,\" he said.\n\"When she got there, there were hundreds of people, and an official came out of the embassy and said, 'I'm sorry, folks. That's it'.\n\"So my mother literally put her foot in the door and said, 'Well, you've got my passport. I've applied for a visa so at least give it me back'.\nHe added: \"So the official pulled her in, sat her down in the entrance hall of the embassy and said, 'Wait there. I'll see what I can do'.\n\"Half an hour later, he came back with the passport and to her great delight, she had this visa stamped in the passport.\"\nThey arrived in Kent on the eve of World War Two.\nMr Herman said they joined his father in Kitchener Camp, the pre-war transit camp set up for Jewish refugees on the outskirts of Sandwich, Kent.\nThe family spent the war in Liverpool where his father worked building aircraft for the RAF before they moved to Manchester and became British citizens.\nMr Herman qualified as an accountant and was also an international sprinter - and even spent several years helping to train Manchester City.\nIn recent times he has shared his story in talks to schoolchildren about the Holocaust.\nHe said having a Holocaust Memorial Day \"keeps it in the public eye\".\n\"Otherwise it just descends into one line in a history book. It's too important for that.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook , X and Instagram ? You can also send story ideas to northwest.newsonline@bbc.co.uk",

    "A group of scientists is urging people to stop vandalising its equipment left on beaches to monitor coastal changes.\nThe Coastsnap monitoring stations are part of a global citizen science project and have been placed at 18 beaches around Devon and Cornwall.\nThey allow people to take photos and send them in to South West Coastal Monitoring, to help them see how the beaches look in different conditions.\nKit has been vandalised at beaches in Newquay, Godrevy and Penzance.\nThe team based at Plymouth University wants to reassure the public the monitoring stations are part of an ongoing study into the changing shape of beaches, and not a way of harvesting personal information.\nNo personal details are taken when photos are submitted using a QR code.\nThe stations consist of a camera cradle and a signpost with information that tries to attract members of the public to take a photo so they track any changes over time.\nJoseff Saunders, a coastal process scientist involved with the project said the equipment had been \"damaged, or defaced or ripped off entirely\" soon after it had been installed.\nHe said: \"We tend to get about one or two photos submitted a day depending on the site, so we may not get any for these sites for a couple of months while we get around to replacing them.\n\"It's an inconvenience from a needles piece of vandalism. It is frustrating.\"\nIt is hoped the stations will remain for at least ten years so it will build a significant catalogue of images for the beaches involved.\nMr Saunders said: \"For such a reasonably priced bit of kit all the way around the coast, it really helps us build a picture of daily interactions occurring at some of these vulnerable sites that are changing quickly.\n\"It changes so drastically day to day and the pictures really help keep an eye on what is happening over time.\"\nFollow BBC News South West on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

    "Sri Lanka's draconian law to regulate online content has come into force, in a move rights groups say is aimed at stifling freedom of speech.\nThe Online Safety Act gives a government commission broad powers to assess and remove \"prohibited\" content.\nAuthorities said it would help fight cybercrime, but critics say it suppresses dissent ahead of elections.\nSocial media had a key role in protests during an economic crisis in 2022, which ousted the then president.\nThe act was passed on 24 January by 108-62 votes - sparking protests outside parliament - and came into effect on Thursday after the Speaker endorsed it.\nThe wide-ranging law prohibit \"false statements about incidents in Sri Lanka\", statements with \"an express intention of hurting religious feelings\" and the misuse of bots, among other things.\nA five-member commission appointed by the president will be given powers to assess these statements, to direct their removal, and to impose penalties on the people who made those statements.\nThe legislation will also make social media platforms liable for messages on their platforms.\nPublic Security Minister Tiran Alles, who introduced the draft legislation in parliament, said it was necessary to tackle offences associated with online fraud and statements that threaten national stability.\nMore than 8,000 complaints related to cybercrimes were filed last year, he noted.\nA Sri Lankan pro-democracy group said on Thursday that the government's \"adamant pursuit\" of the legislation was a \"clear indication of its intention to silent dissent and suppress civic activism\" as the country was still reeling from the consequences of its worst economic crisis.\nFood prices and inflation have reached record levels since the country declared bankruptcy in April 2022 with more than $83bn in debt. Then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to step down and leave the country after thousands of anti-government protesters stormed into his residence.\n\"While the citizens silently suffer amidst escalating cost of living and unmanageable hunger, it is crucial for the rulers to recognise that this silence does not equate to obedience... It is the precursor to a major backlash against the government's coercive rule,\" said the group known as the March 12 Movement.\nRights group Amnesty International said the act's broad provisions and vague wording would restrict people's rights to freedom of expression and privacy online.\n\"[It] is the newest weapon in the government's arsenal of tools that could be used to undermine freedom of expression and suppress dissent,\" said Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, the group's regional researcher for South Asia.\nLast October, the UN's human rights office raised concerns against the draft law saying that it would give authorities \"unfettered discretion to label and restrict expressions they disagree with as 'false statements'\",\nSri Lanka's next presidential elections are expected to be held later this year or early next year.",

    "Fifteen-year-old Zoe Rainey has big ambitions - to present the world's longest-running children's TV programme, CBBC's Blue Peter.\nWhile the bright lights of the studio may be a few years away yet, Zoe has already made a strong impression on the show.\nThe Belfast teenager has earned eight coveted Blue Peter badges since 2020.\nThey were awarded for achievements in sport, reading, environmentalism, music and art.\nZoe has spina bifida, hydrocephalus, epilepsy and associated complications, which have required her to undergo 11 brain surgeries.\n\"I'm so proud of myself, I'm really happy and it just goes to show people even if you have a disability, anything is possible when you believe in yourself and you have a great mindset,\" she told BBC News NI.\nAs a fan of Londonderry-born presenter Adam B, Zoe started watching him on Blue Peter during the Covid pandemic.\n\"From that episode, she was totally hooked and she hasn't missed a single episode since,\" Zoe's mum Kirsty explained.\nAs the family were shielding at home, Zoe focused on learning how to cook and bake, and she was inspired to write to the programme to earn her first badge.\nBlue badges are awarded for sending in interesting letters, stories, craft creations and ideas.\n\"So she she sat down with her iPad, typed her own letter, added her photos and then asked us if we could post it for her,\" Kirsty said.\n\"And that was the start of it once she got her first badge back. She was so excited. She was straight back on the website, and it was 'which one can I go for next?',\" she added.\n'I just kept on going'\nKirsty said the family try to focus on Zoe's abilities, rather than her disabilities, and she is eager to try as many new activities as possible.\n\"She's a happy, easy-going child and she loves a challenge,\" Kirsty explained.\n\"She will always give something a try, she really is a determined young lady... we'll always encourage her to take part in things that are appropriate for her and find a way for her to have the experiences.\"\nOne of Zoe's biggest achievements earned her a sports badge when she raised over \u00c2\u00a36,000 for charity as part of the Mary Peters Trust's Pass the Torch campaign.\nWith a new hand cycle attachment for her wheelchair, and little practice beforehand, Zoe completed 11 laps (approximately 4km) of Belfast's Mary Peters Track in August 2021.\nOlympic gold medallist Lady Mary even joined Zoe for a lap or two.\n\"It was just amazing, it was brilliant, I had a lot of fun and I did it all without having any breaks, no stopping, I just kept on going and - boom - did it,\" Zoe said.\nZoe was then awarded \"fundraiser of the year\" for her efforts and was invited to join Lady Mary at an awards dinner that December.\nA second Blue Peter sports badge was earned for surfing and ice skating - opportunities made possible through the May Murray Foundation.\n\"She loved [the surfing] because she can also do that with her sister, we can all do things together, and it's just life as it should be, all getting out,\" Kirsty said.\n\"One of Zoe's mottos is 'never give up'. She sets a great example to us all. When she gets an idea about something that she wants to do, she finds a way to do it.\n\"Whatever it is, Zoe's up for the adventure.\"\nHer favourite badge is a colourful, limited edition music emblem designed by Ed Sheeran , which was awarded for her participation in the peace proms as well as for learning piano.\nA green badge, made from a recycled yoghurt pot, puts Zoe alongside Sir David Attenborough - who was awarded one in 2019 - for her environmentalism efforts and ideas to encourage families to reduce their screen time.\nZoe's purple fan club badge was awarded for suggesting the programme should introduce a presenter who requires a wheelchair - an idea that was implemented last year when Abby Cook was chosen as the 42nd Blue Peter presenter.\n'Very inspirational'\nZoe recently led an assembly at her school, Fleming Fulton, with the aim of inspiring her classmates to undertake their own challenges.\n\"She did a whole presentation herself, prepared and delivered it,\" her form tutor Ms Murphy said.\n\"She's so kind and just wanted to make that opportunity known to all the other pupils.\"\nMs Murphy said the school is delighted by how much the Year 11 pupil has achieved to date.\n\"I think it's a real testament to how much you can do if you put your mind to it... she's just very inspirational,\" she added.\nSo what's next for Zoe and her badges?\nShe's only missing two of them - an orange one, which is awarded to competition winners, and the highly-coveted gold.\nThat badge is the show's highest accolade and famous recipients include Mary Berry, Paul McCartney, King Charles and Queen Camilla.\nOnly a small number of gold badges are awarded each year, to people who have inspired a nation, saved a life or who have shown bravery and courage.\nThey are also commonly awarded to former presenters - which is Zoe's masterplan, \"hopefully\", she said.\n\"It doesn't really matter if you have a disability.

    "A newborn baby found in east London has been discharged from hospital and is in foster care, a court has heard.\nBaby Elsa was discovered by a dog walker last Thursday, wrapped in a towel inside a bag in Newham in sub-zero temperatures.\nEast London Family Court heard Elsa's parents had not come forward and there was no information about her identity.\nJudge Carol Atkinson issued an interim care order for the baby, requested by Newham Borough Council.\nPolice are still appealing to Elsa's mother to come forward and urge her to get in touch by phone, or walk into a hospital or police station.\nCourt documents suggest the baby was very cold when she was found - it was three hours before doctors could record her temperature.\nHowever, she was crying and responsive the whole time and, later that night, staff reported she was feeding well and named her.\nThe documents show Elsa was born approximately an hour before she was abandoned and still had her umbilical cord.\nDoctors believe she was a full-term baby and weighed 6lbs 6oz (2.9kg) when she was found, the documents say.\nElsa is now medically fit and, on Tuesday, was discharged to foster parents who had been visiting her in hospital.\nThe interim care order will give the local authority parental responsibility for Elsa while further information is gathered about her identity and, in future hearings, the court will decide where her permanent home will be.\nName change request\nDuring the hearing on Thursday, Elsa's court-appointed guardian asked to change her name.\nShe said it appeared to be a reference to the baby being found during the very cold spell, as Elsa was the main character in the Frozen series of Disney films.\nThe guardian's barrister explained the reasoning behind the request, telling the court her name could have an impact on her when older as it might be seen as \"gimmicky\".\nHowever, Judge Carol Atkinson disagreed and said the court needed to consider the position of a child who had lost everything, adding the name they were given when found could be \"something they can hang on to\".\nVery few babies are recorded as abandoned at birth in England and Wales.\nThe Office of National Statistics (ONS) published data until 2015, and that showed no babies were registered as abandoned for the previous three years, with just one logged as abandoned in 2011.\nThere will be a second hearing at East London Family Court in a few weeks' time.\nFamily Courts usually hold hearings in private, but the BBC was given permission to report under a transparency order issued by the judge.\nThis is part of a wider initiative allowing journalists to report family court hearings - which from 29 January will apply to almost half the Family Courts in England and Wales.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "The decision to accept triple killer Valdo Calocane's manslaughter pleas and to give him a hospital order were appropriate, a former chief crown prosecutor has said.\nNazir Afzal said a review, ordered by the attorney general , was raising expectations that will not be met.\nThe victims' families have raised concerns over how the case was handled.\nBut Mr Afzal said accepting Calocane's pleas was \"probably the right decision\".\n\"As I understand it there were five psychiatric reports that all said this man was suffering from mental impairment, so it's appropriate in those circumstances to decide that that's the charge that they would prefer,\" said Mr Afzal, former chief crown prosecutor for North West England.\n\"I'm afraid as a matter of law it was probably the right decision.\"\nCalocane, who has paranoid schizophrenia, stabbed to death 19-year-old students Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, and 65-year-old school caretaker Ian Coates, in killings on 13 June.\nHe was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility in November.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) did not accept these guilty pleas at the time, but did so at a hearing on 23 January.\nMr Afzal told BBC Breakfast: \"Murder would have been the original charge, but if there is a partial defence, and the partial defence in this case would be diminished responsibility - namely that the person who carried out these terrible killings was suffering a mental impairment at the time - then the option becomes available as to whether or not to charge manslaughter.\"\nHowever, Barnaby Webber's mother Emma said the decision to accept the pleas had left them \"horrified\", with her claiming they had been \"railroaded\" by the CPS.\n\"At no point during the previous five and a half months were we given any indication that this could conclude in anything other than murder,\" she said.\nFollowing this, Attorney General Victoria Prentis said she had ordered an \"urgent review\" of the CPS's handling of the case.\nMr Azfal, the former chief executive of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners and current chancellor of the University of Manchester, said he felt the review would make no difference to the outcome.\nHe said: \"All that review will do is to provide some scrutiny as to how they came about that decision, whether they had appropriate meetings with the families, what was said, but it will not change the decision.\n\"I think people need to be clear about that. The government, by using language like 'urgent review', undoubtedly are raising expectations which unfortunately are not going to be met.\"\nIn response to the family's concerns, the CPS said: \"Our thoughts and sympathies are with the families of the victims at this incredibly difficult time.\n\"Engagement with those who have been left bereaved is one of our highest priorities and in all cases we continue to liaise with victims' families throughout the legal process.\"\nThe attorney general is also considering whether or not Court of Appeal judges should review Calocane's sentence, after he was given an indefinite hospital order.\nBaroness Louise Casey told Radio 5 Live that she thought the judge had \"got it wrong\" and suggested a hybrid order would be more appropriate.\nBut Mr Afzal said reviewing the judge's decision was unlikely to achieve anything either, as he said an indefinite hospital order was the equivalent of a life sentence.\n\"It probably will make no difference, but it's important for her to consider it appropriately given the valid concerns that the families have about the way that they've been communicated with throughout the whole process,\" he said.\nWhen Calocane was sentenced, the judge told him: \"I will say at the outset that the sentence I am about to pass upon you will result in you being detained in a high security hospital, very probably for the rest of your life.\"\nThe victims' families have called for assurances that Calocane would never be released, but Mr Afzal said this was very unlikely.\n\"There is the smallest possibility that he would recover from this illness that he's currently suffering from,\" he said.\n\"I think the judge made it clear that it was very unlikely.\n\"There's no 100% guarantee here, which undoubtedly is what's causing the families' concern, but historically and from previous cases I've dealt with, when somebody gets an indefinite hospital order, that's the last time you ever see them.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "When Ipswich Town host Maidstone United in the FA Cup on Saturday, few people will be watching with more interest than Darren Oxbrow. The former Town defender went on to make a record number of league appearances for the Stones before forging a new career as a police officer.\n\"Devastating.\" That is how Oxbrow remembers the news back in 1989 that he was being released by Ipswich Town , the club he had supported since he was a boy.\nBut his career was soon back on track with Maidstone United , newly promoted to the Fourth Division of the Football League.\nPlaying for his hometown club had been a lifelong dream for the Ipswich-born centre-half, who stood on a milk crate at Portman Road to watch his first match, and cheered on the likes of George Burley, Mick Mills, Terry Butcher, Russell Osman and Paul Mariner through the Blues' late-70s and early-80s heyday.\nSigning schoolboy forms as a 14-year-old, he trained with the club twice a week before playing for the Town youth team.\n\"I remember playing for them away at Portsmouth, and that was my first experience of playing for the Town - putting the shirt on... going to the game with the rest of the players,\" remembers Oxbrow, now 54.\n\"I remember coming on, playing right midfield... had a half-decent game, came back and thought that was it, I'm going to be a professional footballer.\n\"I was still in school, but eventually got offered a two-year apprenticeship with the club, which obviously I took up, and had two great years with the club as a young lad.\"\nHe signed a professional contract, but with players such as Chris O'Donnell, Mich d'Avray, Ian Atkins and Ian Cranson ahead of him in the pecking order, was unable to break into the first team.\n\"For me, all I wanted to do was just make one first-team appearance, but unfortunately that wasn't to be,\" he says.\nNevertheless, he has fond memories of playing for the reserves at grounds including Highbury, White Hart Lane and Stamford Bridge.\nWhen his first professional contract with Ipswich was ending, then-manager Bobby Ferguson watched him in a reserves match and was impressed.\nOxbrow was told he would be offered a new contract.\n\"But unfortunately, Mr Ferguson got the sack a few weeks later and so the Town job was up for grabs, and the two candidates that went for it were John Duncan and Keith Peacock, an ex-Charlton man,\" he says.\n\"John Duncan got the job, went through the playing staff and made the decision he was going to let me go.\n\"From having that euphoria, thinking 'I've got another year's contract' to then being released, it was devastating.\"\nSoon after, however, Peacock became manager of Maidstone United. His first signing was Oxbrow, who turned down Leyton Orient and Burnley to sign for the Kent side.\nOxbrow made his Maidstone debut on 7 October 1989, holding his place as they made it to the play-offs in their first season in the Football League.\nThey lost in extra-time in the second leg of the semi-final against Cambridge United - and an incident from that match still rankles with Oxbrow.\n\"It was alleged that I brought down Dion Dublin for the penalty... and they converted it and went through, unfortunately,\" he says.\n\"I dispute it to this day. I definitely got the ball, cleared the ball and Dublin threw himself to the floor and got a penalty.\n\"I've never got the opportunity to talk to him about it, but he went on to great things.\"\nOxbrow, named Maidstone's young player of the year, became a fixture in the side, and his 85 league appearances, before financial pressures forced the club to fold in 1992, remain a Stones record.\n\"That won't get broken, I think, for quite a while,\" says Oxbrow.\nHe has happy memories of his time with the club, which after it folded, was reborn as Maidstone Invicta 10 tiers down the league pyramid before readopting the United name in 1995 and battling back up again.\nThe reformed club now plays in the Vanarama National League South.\n\"It was fantastic. They had such a great bunch of players as well - some real characters in the team that had obviously come up from the Conference with them,\" he says.\nHis contemporaries included Warren Barton, who went on to play for Wimbledon, Newcastle United and England, and Mark Beeney, who later played in goal for Brighton and Leeds United.\nThe club's collapse was another blow for newly-married Oxbrow, who moved back to Ipswich and signed for Colchester United.\nHe made 24 appearances for the U's, scoring four goals, but fell out with legendary player-manager \"Red Card Roy\" McDonough.\n\"It started off OK, but I wasn't his kind of player,\" Oxbrow says.\n\"I had different priorities at the time.

    "A man extradited from Scotland to America after faking his death to avoid rape charges could be forced to attend court, a judge has ruled.\nNicholas Rossi has now refused to appear at two hearings at separate courts in Utah on rape charges.\nThe 36-year-old spent more than two years fighting the case claiming to be an Irish orphan called Arthur Knight.\nThe judge set a new date of 8 March and granted an order to use reasonable force to compel Rossi to attend.\nAfter calling the case on Friday, Judge Barry Lawrence of Utah's Third District Court was told that Rossi had refused to appear by video link from prison.\nThe hearing was over an allegation of rape in Salt Lake County.\nNicholas Rossi's lawyer Sam Duggan told the court that she was unaware of why he was refusing to appear, but said he suffers from \"a variety of fairly serious medical issues that I have heard about from his other attorney.\"\nShe told the judge that she did not know as much about his back story as she would like but added that he \"goes by Arthur Knight\".\nRepresentatives from the state asked the judge to issue an order to use reasonable force to ensure Rossi attends.\nThe judge agreed but said the order could be removed if his lawyer provides the court with a reason for why the order should not apply.\nThis followed a separate hearing on Monday in Utah's Fourth District Court over a rape allegation Rossi faces in Utah County.\nJudge Derek Pullan of Utah's Fourth District Court was told Rossi would not appear by video link from prison.\nA new date of 6 February was set for his appearance. Judge Pullan also told the court that if Rossi was not ill then he would \"authorise reasonable force to compel his attendance\".\n'Mistaken identity'\nRossi was arrested under an international arrest warrant in December 2021 after being admitted to hospital in Glasgow with Covid.\nHe claimed to have been the victim of mistaken identity and insisted his name was Arthur Knight.\nBut in November 2022 a sheriff in Edinburgh ruled that he was Nicholas Rossi after hearing that his tattoos and fingerprints matched.\nHe lost his final appeal against extradition on 14 December last year.\nProsecutors in Utah said he was charged with raping a 21-year-old woman in 2008.\nRossi was not identified as a suspect until about a decade later due to a backlog of DNA test kits at the state's crime lab.\nDuring the previous hearing, he denied being Nicholas Rossi and said his name was Arthur Knight Brown.",
    "It is a deal that was kept as a closely-guarded secret between the UK government and leadership of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nThe DUP had demanded changes to the way Northern Ireland trades with Great Britain to ease its concerns over post-Brexit rules and the Irish Sea border.\nOn Wednesday the 76-page agreement was published by the government.\nIt lays out several new measures aimed at simplifying domestic imports and encouraging trade between GB and NI.\nEntitled Safeguarding the Union , the command paper was presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris.\nWhat will it mean for Irish Sea border goods checks?\nMost significantly, the DUP's deal with the government will reduce checks and paperwork on goods moving from the rest of the UK into Northern Ireland.\nIt means there would no longer be \"routine\" checks on GB goods which are sent to Northern Ireland with the intention of staying there.\nThose changes involve the maximum flexibility allowed under a previous EU/UK deal.\nIt is understood the move will be acceptable to the EU.\nOn Tuesday the UK and EU Joint Committee reached agreement to make changes to that previous deal to allow Northern Ireland to benefit from UK Free Trade Agreements.\nThe UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation to guarantee Northern Ireland goods can be sold in GB in all circumstances and to affirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK.\nNo more 'Not available in Northern Ireland'?\nThe DUP deal includes the establishment of a new body, Intertrade UK, to promote trade within the UK.\nIt is modelled on Intertrade Ireland , a body jointly funded by Stormont and the Irish government to help small businesses develop cross-border markets on the island of Ireland.\nIntertrade UK's remit will be to provide advice aimed at boosting trade between the UK's constituent parts.\nThat will include tackling the 'Not available in Northern Ireland' issue which can afflict online shoppers when they are trying to buy goods from other parts of the UK.\nThe issue pre-dates Brexit and is a regular annoyance to Northern Ireland consumers.\nGB businesses will not be forced to sell to Northern Ireland, but they will be helped to tackle barriers making them to reluctant to send good across the Irish Sea.\nScottish border control post plan scrapped\nThe government has also confirmed it will not build a border control post at Cairnryan.\nThe Scottish port is the main access point of Northern Ireland goods entering Great Britain.\nA border control post had been planned in order to check Republic of Ireland goods being sent to Scotland via Northern Ireland ports.\nThat was politically controversial as it raised the prospect of Northern Ireland goods also being caught up in the checks.\nThe border control post plan has now been scrapped, but lorries from the Republic of Ireland will still be subject to spot checks.\nNew UK legislation to be screened for effects on NI\nThe complications posed by Brexit include how goods should be traded in cases where UK production techniques vary from EU standards.\nAlthough there is little divergence at present, production rules could diverge significantly in the future.\nThe deal states that when UK government ministers are introducing new legislation, they will be compelled to tell Parliament if their Bill will have \"significant adverse implications for Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market\".\nIf their Bill is expected to cause problems for trade between NI and GB, the UK government will then set out any measures it proposes to take to protect the internal market.\nThe government will also require public authorities to include \"an explicit Internal Market Assessment\" as part of their usual regulatory checks to identify any adverse impact on the UK's internal market.\nIt said guidance would make it clear that this could include \"incentives for trade diversion or barriers to businesses placing goods on the market in any part of the UK\".\nWhy did the DUP ask for these changes?\nThe DUP is the biggest unionist party at Stormont and believes Northern Ireland should remain an integral part of the UK.\nBut as Northern Ireland shares a land border with an EU member state - the Republic of Ireland - Brexit has complicated trading relationships.\nNorthern Ireland's Brexit deal, the Windsor Framework , keeps it inside the EU's single market for goods.\nThat prevented a post-Brexit trade border having to be erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nHowever it has meant the introduction of checks and controls at Northern Ireland's ports on goods imported from GB - creating a trade border in the Irish Sea.\nThat angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing government for the past two years.\nOn Monday night, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson won the support of his party's executive to return to Stormont on the basis of the deal, subject to the legislation being passed at Westminster.",
    "Boeing faces a \"serious challenge\" and uncertain outlook as it seeks to restore confidence, its boss Dave Calhoun admitted, announcing the firm's latest financial results on Wednesday.\nTrust in the firm has been shaken since a panel of one of its 737 Max 9 jets broke off in mid-air.\nThe incident has renewed questions five years after two fatal accidents on another version of its planes.\nMr Calhoun has been trying to show the firm is taking the situation seriously.\nOn a call with financial analysts, he apologised and said the company took responsibility, no matter what the ongoing formal investigation into what caused it concluded.\n\"We caused the problem and we understand that,\" he said. \"We simply must do better.\"\nThe quarterly update to investors is the company's first since the accident on the Alaska Airlines flight, which terrified passengers and forced an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport that occurred without serious injury.\nMr Calhoun has previously blamed it on a \"quality escape\".\nReports suggest that the panel was improperly installed when the plane left Boeing's factory.\nIt has prompted new scrutiny of the company's manufacturing record, which critics say has suffered as the firm pushed to cut costs and speed deliveries.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched an investigation of Boeing's manufacturing process and barred the firm from expanding production of its popular 737 Max planes.\nSome of the company's biggest airline customers have also expressed concerns, noting that the issues may delay approval of new versions of the 737 Max plane, the Max 7 and Max 10, that are in the works.\nMr Calhoun said the company would defer to regulators.\n\"I know these moments that can impact delivery schedules can frustrate our customers and investors but quality and safety must come before all else,\" he said.\n\"We are going to go slow to go fast and we will encourage and reward employees for speaking up to slow things down if that's what needed,\" he said.\nOn the call with investors, Mr Calhoun limited his prepared remarks to the company's response to the Alaska Airlines emergency.\nThe company also said it would not offer formal financial guidance for the 2024 year.\n\"While we often use this time of year to share or update our financial and operational objectives, now is not the time for that,\" Mr Calhoun wrote in a letter to staff that accompanied the results.\nAnalysts pressed Mr Calhoun about what the turmoil would mean for the company in the years ahead, with one questioning how the lapse could have occurred after the spotlight that was cast on the company after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving another version of its 737 Max plane killed 346 people.\nThe issues have hit the company's shares which tumbled 20% at one point.\nThe Rhode Island treasurer on Tuesday filed a proposed class-action lawsuit on behalf of shareholders, accusing the company of continuing to prioritise \"profits over safety\" after those accidents, despite public promises to the contrary.\nBoeing declined to comment on the lawsuit.\nAmong airline safety campaigners, the emergency has sparked calls for new leadership and the ouster of Mr Calhoun, who has served on the board since 2009 and was installed as chief executive after the earlier crashes.\n\"They had their chance. They failed. They are unable or unwilling to do the task and should leave,\" said Michael Stumo, whose daughter was killed in the Ethiopia Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 crash and has now become a vocal airline safety advocate.\nThe investor update for the September to December period showed the manufacturing giant was currently producing 737 planes at a rate of 38 a month.\nRevenue rose 10% to $22bn, while the company's losses in the quarter narrowed to $283m.",

She provided a video message to Essex residents.\nMr Harris, who is based near Southend-on-Sea, also runs a parenting blog and gained an online following by targeting Conservative politicians and policies in a series of internet stunts.\nWhen asked why its own communications team was not involved in the social media campaigns, an Essex County Council spokesperson said this activity was being brought back in house from March.\n\"Before the pandemic, we commissioned work to develop a network of online digital communities via social media, building relationships and connections with existing groups to support public health messaging and behaviour change,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"This work was vital in getting to the heart of communities in Essex and was particularly important during an exceptional period of national emergency.\"\nMuch of the spending came from central government grants, the spokesperson said.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A former US tax worker has been sentenced to five years in prison over the unauthorised leak of Donald Trump's personal tax records to media outlets.\nCharles Littlejohn, 38, must also spend three years under supervised release and pay a $5,000 fine for his actions.\nLittlejohn stole tax data from thousands of wealthy Americans while working as a contractor for the US-wide Internal Revenue Service.\nHis sentence was the statutory maximum penalty that could have been imposed.\nLittlejohn's offence was \"an attack on our constitutional democracy\", federal District Judge Ana Reyes said before sentencing him on Monday.\n\"He targeted the sitting president of the United States of America, and that is exceptional by any measure,\" she added. \"It cannot be open season on our elected officials.\"\nIn a brief statement to the court, Littlejohn acknowledged his crime and said he had been aware of its potential consequences at the time but claimed he was driven by a desire for transparency.\n\"I made my decision with full knowledge that I would likely end up in a courtroom to answer for my serious crime,\" he said.\n\"I used my skills to systematically violate the privacy of thousands of people.\"\nHis legal team argued in a court filing that Littlejohn had acted \"out of a deep, moral belief that the American people had a right to know the information and sharing it was the only way to effect change\".\n\"He did what he thought was right at the time, but now fully acknowledges that he was wrong,\" his lawyers added.\nThat explanation did not appear to sway Judge Reyes in her sentencing decision.\nShe said imposing the maximum penalty would ensure nobody could view Littlejohn's conduct as \"acceptable or justifiable or worth the trade-off\".\n\"The fact that he did what he did and he is facing one felony count, I have no words for,\" the judge said.\nLittlejohn pleaded guilty in October to one count of disclosing tax return information.\nAlthough charging records did not name Mr Trump as the government official victimised by his conduct, the ex-contractor identified him aloud in court as he admitted to the crime.\nHe also said that he had given information about Mr Trump's taxes to two US media outlets, the New York Times and ProPublica. Neither organisation is accused of wrongdoing.\nLawyers representing the government told the court on Monday that Littlejohn \"sought to influence an election and reshape the nation's political discourse\" in one of the \"most serious\" crimes in IRS history.\nThey alleged that, over a two-year period at the tax agency, Littlejohn \"abused his position\" and \"weaponised his access to unmasked taxpayer data to further his own personal, political agenda\".\nSome of the other tax returns he admitted to acquiring dated as far back as 15 years, they claimed in a court filing.\nThe New York Times published an extensive report on Mr Trump's tax returns in September 2020, revealing he paid only $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency and no taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years.\nIn an editor's note, the paper's then-editor affirmed the press's right \"to publish newsworthy information that was legally obtained by reporters\".\nProPublica meanwhile is said to have received a storage device from Littlejohn that contained tax returns and sensitive information for thousands of other wealthy people.\nFollowing his sentencing on Monday, Littlejohn was ordered to turn himself in by 30 April.",

Registered dogs must be kept on a lead and muzzled in public.\nThe government says it received more than 35,000 applications for exemption.\nAnyone choosing not to keep their XL bully had to take it to a registered vet to be euthanised by 31 January 2024 and could claim up to \u00c2\u00a3200 compensation.\nThe government says more than 150 compensation claims have been received.\nPolice can seize unregistered prohibited dogs, and owners face a criminal record and an unlimited fine.\nAre American XL bullies banned in Scotland and Northern Ireland?\nScotland will introduce similar restrictions on 23 February with exemption certificates needed from 31 July.\nThere had been an influx of dogs being rehomed north of the border ahead of the English ban.\nA decision on whether to ban the dogs in Northern Ireland is expected shortly.\nHow could owners register to exempt their American XL bully?\nPrior to 1 February 2024, owners over the age of 16 could apply for a certificate of exemption.\nThey had to acquire insurance, microchip their dog and pay a \u00c2\u00a392.40 application fee per animal.\nOlder dogs must also be neutered by 30 June, or the end of 2024 if the dog is younger than one.\nExempt dogs must be kept in a secure place.\nHow dangerous is the American XL bully and how many attacks have there been?\nThere are no official statistics on attacks by individual dog breeds in the UK.\nAccording to data collected by BBC News from 37 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, the number of recorded dog attacks in general has risen by more than a third in five years.\nIn 2022, there were nearly 22,000 cases, up from just over 16,000 in 2018.\nThe government says 23 deaths have been caused by dog attacks since the start of 2021, \"with the XL bully being disproportionately involved\".\nIn several cases, XL bullies have killed their owners or bystanders, including 55-year-old Ian Langley, 52-year-old Ian Price, 65-year-old Ann Dunn, 17-month-old Bella-Rae Birch and 10-year-old Jack Lis.\nNHS consultant Richard Baker told BBC News that the dogs' powerful jaws inflict more damaging wounds than other breeds, resulting in broken bones, shredded skin and damaged nerves.\n\"It's a crushing or a tearing injury,\" he said. \"Once they grip, they don't let go.\"\nWhy do some charities oppose the American XL bully ban?\nBreed-specific bans do not work and are unfair on responsible owners and their animals, according to the Dog Control Coalition.\nThe group includes the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, the Dogs Trust, the Kennel Club, the RSPCA and the British Veterinary Association.\nIt is calling for a complete overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act, including tougher penalties for owners who fail to control their dogs.\nWhich other breeds are banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act?\nFour other breeds are banned in the UK under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 :\nHave you encountered or do you own an American bully XL?

    "\"I hope it's nearly as impactful for the rest of my community as it was for me to play this character.\"\nAvantika Vandanapu plays the role of \"bimbo\" Karen Shetty in the new Mean Girls musical and feels it's a chance to change perceptions around South Asians in the film industry.\nThe ditzy character was originally played by Amanda Seyfried in the 2004 film, but Avantika joins a new cast and thinks it can \"break stereotypes\".\n\"Of what we encourage women to be and what we encourage women to think like,\" she tells BBC Asian Network.\nIn the original film, teen royalty Karen is a character who arguably doesn't think much, whether it's putting her whole fist in her mouth, having a \"fifth sense\" or crushing on a cousin.\nBut for Avantika, hearing the line \"God Karen, you're so stupid\" was actually pretty empowering.\n\"Karen feels like somebody who embraces being a bimbo and embraces being someone who's sexual.\n\"I think playing that kind of character, especially as a South Asian woman is really, really crazy,\" the 19-year-old says.\n'Joy of musical numbers'\nThe musical, like the film, has been written by Tina Fey, and Avantika praises the team \"for casting someone who visually also feels antithetical to someone who was like that\".\nShe says it's important for her as an actress to \"not spend my entire life in this industry forever being perceived as someone who can only play the shy nerd\".\n\"And that people see me as something different.\n\"It's validated this feeling that I can truly play different characters and embody different people.\"\nThe film has debuted to mixed reviews, but Avantika was praised by some critics for \"knockout comic timing\".\nMean Girls isn't Avantika's first role in a Hollywood production - she's also appeared in TV series The Sex Lives of College Girls.\nAnd before that, she was acting in Indian films, which she feels were more \"male-dominated\".\n\"I think even now films and stories feel very hero-centric.\n\"But the industry has moved in a way where it feels like we're like honouring the female perspective a little more. Which I think has been really nice to see.\"\nAnother difference, she says, is that working on set is less intense in Hollywood.\nShe describes \"getting a timed break and being able to do school while filming\" as a \"really big luxury for me\".\n\"The film industries [in India] are a different beast. It was much, much more difficult, like we just work more hours there and it's a little bit more of a hustle.\"\nBut Avantika says both \"industries have their pluses and minuses\".\n\"The joy of doing Indian musical numbers and working with people who speak the same language as you.\n\"And working with people who look like you in a country where everyone's brown, there's no stereotype to fall back into.\n\"I think that's incredibly liberating,\" she says.\nListen to Ankur Desai's show on BBC Asian Network live from 15:00-18:00 Monday to Thursday - or listen back here .",

    "The Supreme Court has refused to grant a last-minute reprieve to an Alabama death row inmate facing the first ever US execution by nitrogen inhalation.\nThe justices have twice declined, along with a federal appeals court, to block what Kenneth Eugene Smith's lawyers call a \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\nOpponents say using nitrogen gas could cause unnecessary suffering, and a leak could harm people present in the room.\nSmith, 58, was convicted in 1989 of murdering Elizabeth Sennett.\nAlabama's death warrant expires early on Friday morning.\nSmith, who has been on death row since 1996, told the BBC earlier this week that the wait felt like torture.\nHe will be the first person to be put to death by this method in the US and, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, anywhere in the world.\nBreathing pure nitrogen without oxygen causes the cells to break down and leads to death. Alabama said in a court filing that they expect him to lose consciousness within seconds and die in a matter of minutes.\nBut its use has been denounced by some medical professionals, who warn it could cause a range of catastrophic mishaps, ranging from violent convulsions to survival in a vegetative state.\nAlabama and two other US states have approved the use of nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative method of execution because the drugs used in lethal injections have become more difficult to find, contributing to a fall in the number of executions nationally.\nAlabama already tried to execute Smith by lethal injection two years ago but were unable to raise a vein before the state's death warrant expired.\nSmith was one of two men convicted of murdering Mrs Sennett in a $1,000 (\u00c2\u00a3790) killing-for-hire in  March 1988.\nThe 45-year-old was beaten with a fireplace implement and stabbed in the chest and neck, and her death was staged to look like a home invasion and burglary.\nHer husband Charles Sennett, a debt-ridden preacher, had orchestrated the scheme to collect insurance money. He killed himself as investigators closed in.\nSmith's fellow hitman, John Forrest Parker, was executed in 2010.\nAt his trial Smith admitted to being present when the victim was killed, but said he did not take part in the attack.\nThe UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights has said gassing Smith could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and called for a halt.\nSmith's lawyers lodged a challenge with the Supreme Court, arguing that putting convicts through multiple execution attempts violates the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects against \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\nOn Wednesday, the justices declined to hear the appeal and denied his request to halt the execution. No justice publicly dissented from the ruling.\nSmith also made a separate legal challenge to the lower 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, where he contested the legality of Alabama's nitrogen gas protocol.\nBut that court also rejected the inmate's request for an injunction in a ruling on Wednesday evening.\nA final appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected again on Thursday, with three liberal justices noting public dissents this time.\nSmith's legal team argues the nitrogen gas method is \"recently released and untested\", leaving him at risk of choking on his own vomit.\nState Attorney General Steve Marshall previously called it \"perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised\".\nSmith's spiritual adviser, Reverend Jeff Hood, will be present in the room when the execution happens. He told the BBC he believes he will be in danger if the nitrogen leaks.\nOn Wednesday, prison officials escorted Rev Hood for a \"walk-through\" of the execution chamber, as required by Alabama's execution protocol.\nHe told the BBC afterwards that he saw oxygen-level meters unplugged on a ledge inside the room, which he described as \"unbelievably disturbing, it feels like you are at the centre of evil\".\n\"I asked 'what's the safety plan?' and they said they didn't want to get into it, they couldn't get into it,\" he said.\n\"Once again we're back at this place of having to rely on these people who have botched three executions in the last [few] years, he said. \"It's absolutely a terrifying thing to think that your life hangs in the balance with these guys\".\nRev Hood said he had requested that Alabama's Governor Kay Ivey be present in the chamber during the execution to demonstrate her confidence in its safety, but had not received a response.\n\"We have somebody who is championing this type of execution in the governor and yet she is unwilling to get her hands dirty,\" he said.\nThe BBC has approached Ms Ivey's office for comment regarding this and the latest accusations over safety.\nAlabama has one of the highest per capita execution rates in the US and has 165 people currently on death row.\nSince 2018, the state has been responsible for three botched attempts at lethal injection in which the condemned inmates survived.\nThe failures led to an internal review that largely placed ",

There has been a distinct paucity of research into this disease, compared to other long-term conditions, which means that ME is still without a cure.\n\"As a result, we remind people to only take medical advice from appropriately qualified healthcare professionals and to ensure that any treatment decisions are evidence-based and fully informed.\"\nThe letter also said broadcasters must make \"every effort to ensure that content is accurate and does not contain misleading and potentially dangerous information\".\nAction for ME said on social media that it had also written to BBC director-general Tim Davie to voice its concerns about the episode.",

I will keep on pushing to ensure that our county gets the level of funding it needs, so that residents are not left to pick up an increasing amount of the cost of policing in future years.\"\nThe proposed increase for the fire service would amount to an extra \u00c2\u00a32.19 a year for the average Band D household.\nMr Mold said Northamptonshire's fire service is one of the \"lowest funded in the country, with the second lowest precept levels\".\n\"The service has worked hard to reach a stable financial position - it is efficient and effective and keeps people safe.\n\"Thanks to that, we can manage within the budget and invest in some improvements - but future years look more challenging,\" he added.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A baby whose body was found in a shed spent much of her life being carried in a Lidl \"bag for life\" while her parents lived \"off-grid\", a court has heard.\nConstance Marten, 36, and Mark Gordon, 49, are on trial for the manslaughter of newborn Victoria, whose body was discovered in March 2023 after a weeks-long search for the family.\nProsecutors said the baby would still be alive if it were not for the \"reckless\" behaviour of the defendants.\nThe pair deny the charges.\nOutlining the case against the defendants, prosecutor Tom Little KC told jurors the couple previously had four other children, all of whom had been taken into care after extensive involvement from social services.\nHe said the couple \"essentially went off-grid\" and lived outside to avoid social services removing their new baby, concealing the pregnancy from family and the health service.\nThe Old Bailey heard that only the defendants knew the precise date the baby was born, but the prosecution said she appeared to have been born after 28 December 2022.\nOn 5 January, a car the family had allegedly been travelling in was discovered on fire on a road in Greater Manchester. When it was searched a placenta wrapped in a towel was found inside.\nThe couple had left before police arrived and a high-risk missing persons inquiry was launched.\nTwo days later, Mr Little KC told jurors they dumped a buggy in London and \"the child was transferred and carried in a Lidl 'bag for life' where it would appear it spent much of its life before it died\".\nJurors were told the couple lived in a tent alongside their baby in \"freezing and obviously dangerous conditions\" - conditions which prosecutors allege ultimately led to her death.\nMr Little KC told jurors Ms Marten and Mr Gordon spent hundreds of pounds on taxi journeys while classed as missing people rather than putting it towards a \"roof over their heads and warmth and safety\".\nHe said that by the middle of February 2023 they had been \"living rough for over a month\", sometimes in \"freezing cold, windy and wet\" weather, and at one stage the couple were scavenging for food from bins.\nThe jury was told Ms Marten - who was not in court to hear the prosecution's opening - did not have a \"deprived upbringing\" and had \"potential access to the money and whatever help she needed\".\nThere was a sighting of Victoria as late as 19 February but the baby was not with Ms Marten and Mr Gordon when they were arrested on 27 February. When officers detained the couple, Ms Marten had what appeared to be stuffing from furniture inside her clothing, and Mr Gordon was still wearing a Christmas jumper.\nOn 1 March, prosecutors say baby Victoria's body was found in a shed in Brighton in the same Lidl bag she had been seen being carried in, covered in rubbish.\nPathologists have been unable to establish a cause of death.\nIn a police interview after the body was found, Ms Marten gave conflicting dates for Victoria's death, but said she had fallen asleep sitting up holding the baby in her jacket and awoke to find her dead.\nShe told officers she kept the body because she wanted an autopsy to be performed, adding: \"I've been carrying her around not knowing what to do.\"\nMs Marten also told police she and Mr Gordon had planned to buy a flat but were recognised when they travelled to London to find one.\nShe continued: \"In order to save [the baby] from the services, then we would have to probably remove ourselves from society till we could find a house\"\nMr Gordon told police their situation went \"really down really quickly\" after their car caught fire with possessions inside.\nMs Marten said in an interview they considered turning themselves in and insisted the baby had adequate clothing to survive outdoors, which the prosecution disputes.\nMr Little KC said the couple had put their relationship and \"view of life\" above the baby's safety, adding Victoria \"would still be alive... if it was not for the reckless, utterly selfish, callous, cruel, arrogant and ultimately grossly negligent conduct of these two defendants\".\nMs Marten and Mr Gordon are charged with manslaughter by gross negligence of their baby between 4 January 2023 and 27 February 2023.\nThe couple are also accused of four other offences : cruelty to their baby; concealment of the baby's birth; causing or allowing her death; and perverting the course of justice by concealing the body.\nThe trial continues.",

His bank account was overdrawn.\"\nBear's OnlyFans account had 1,061 subscribers when he uploaded the video on 8 November 2020, Ms Mackenzie added.\nThis number increased by 822 after a month of the video being published which could be viewed for $9.99 (\u00c2\u00a37.95), she continued.\nBear, from Loughton, was jailed for 21 months in March 2023 after a jury found him guilty of voyeurism and disclosing private, sexual photographs and films.\nHe was released from HMP Brixton , in London, earlier this month.\n'Dancing in shadows'\nMs Mackenzie said she calculated the \u00c2\u00a322,305.46 based on fees paid by viewers and based on the amount of subscribers he gained.\nThe prosecution said Bear had \"refused to provide information he was required to\".\n\"The Twitter billionaire is not prepared to stand in the witness box but instead stays in the dock,\" Mr Bousfield said.\n\"What he is really doing is dancing in the shadows here. He is not prepared to show how much he earned from OnlyFans.\"\nGemma Rose, mitigating, said it was hard to prove what a \"regular amount\" of subscriber growth Bear would have had in the month after he published the video.\nJudge Morgan, however, agreed with the prosecution's calculation.\nHe said Bear had increased the cost of his subscription fee and how much people had to pay to view the video.\n\"That is made up from monies obtained from the video payment wall [and] monies obtained from the subscription increase, applying changes in value of money in both,\" the judge added.\nBear, who was supported by members of his family, appeared in court wearing a black suit.\nIn an earlier civil case, he was ordered to pay Ms Harrison more than \u00c2\u00a3200,000 in damages , however, the court heard none of that had yet been paid.\nHis criminal trial heard that although the sex was consensual, Ms Harrison was unaware the footage, shot in Bear's garden, was being shared more widely.\nThe hearing was adjourned until 4 March.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A \"rare\" Mr Fish tie bought for 99p in a charity shop has gone on display in a fashion exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands.\nThe tie was purchased by charity shop enthusiast Janneke van der Wal.\nCreated by designer Michael Fish, it is a \"Kipper tie\", known for its unusually wide shape.\nMs van der Wal, 65, said after buying the tie in an AgeUK shop in Southampton she looked up the designer and decided to contact the museum to donate it.\nShe said: \"I'm not in the habit of buying ties at all, but I saw it out of the corner of my eye and there was just something about it: the vibrant colours and the width. It reminded me of the seventies.\n\"I had absolutely no use for it, but thought perhaps it would come in handy if there ever was a fancy dress party.\"\nMs van der Wal added: \"Once home, I noticed the Mr Fish label which sounded kinda zany, so decided to search the internet to see if I could find out a little more about it.\n\"I didn't get very far, but far enough to realise that maybe a museum might be interested in it.\n\"It just goes to show, you never know what you might find - I'm thrilled to see the tie is now part of this fantastic exhibition.\"\nMichael Fish was known for rejecting the concept of gendered clothing and revitalising menswear staples, and his use of bold colours and luxurious fabrics made him popular with A-list celebrities in the 1960s.\nThe museum said the menswear founder was a key figure of the 1960s and 1970s counterculture movement called the peacock revolution, and would go on to launch his own business called Mr Fish.\nDuring the era he dressed the likes of Mick Jagger, Michael Caine and Muhammad Ali, and also designed David Bowie's dress worn on the album cover of \"The Man Who Sold the World\".\nThe museum described the tie found by Ms van der Wal as \"rare\" and said it was now part of its Fashion City exhibition, which tells the story of Jewish designers, makers and retailers who gave London its sharp fashion reputation.\nOther second-hand pieces featured in the exhibition include an Alexon coat bought from a charity shop for EastEnders character Dot Cotton and a leopard-print hat by famous milliner Otto Lucas, purchased from eBay.\nMr Lucas' hats featured on the covers of Vogue and were worn by clients including Wallis Simpson and film star Greta Garbo.\nLucie Whitmore, curator of Fashion City, said the team were \"delighted\" to have \"iconic pieces of London fashion in our collection and on display in the exhibition\".\n\"Given the strong connection between Jewish makers and second-hand fashions, there is a wonderful symmetry to them finding a home at the museum this way,\" she said.\nFashion City: How Jewish Londoners Shaped Global Style is due to run until April.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "India is home to 718 snow leopards, according to the first-ever survey of the animal in the country, the federal environment ministry has said.\nThis means that Indian snow leopards account for roughly 10-15% of the big cat's global population.\nThe snow leopard is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nIts numbers in the wild face multiple threats - from habitat loss and poaching to infrastructure development.\nThe survey - Snow Leopard Population Assessment in India (SPAI) Program - was done from 2019 to 2023.\nIt was conducted as part of the Population Assessment of the World's Snow Leopards (Paws), a global effort to determine the snow leopard's numbers.\nThe survey in India covered roughly 120,000 sq km (46,332 sq miles) of the animal's habitat across the trans-Himalayan region.\n\"Until recent years, the snow leopard range in India was undefined due to a lack of extensive nationwide assessments for this vulnerable species,\" the environment ministry said in a statement.\nThe survey covered 70% of the potential snow leopard habitat in the country, including the regions of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir, the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand in northern India, and  Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh in the northeast.\nAfter camera traps identified 214 individual snow leopards, surveyors analysed leopard trails and other data to estimate the animal's population at 718.\nThe report says that understanding the precise population of the animal is important because of its role as the apex predator in the Himalayan ecosystem.\nThe snow leopard population can indicate health of the ecosystem as well as help identify potential threats to its habitat and shifts caused by climate change, it adds.\n\"The integrity of these high-altitude habitats is intertwined with the socio-cultural fabric of local communities and the economic sustenance of populations residing downstream.\"\nThe report says that 70% of the land used by the animal is unprotected and provides critical habitat for wildlife.\nThe animal will need consistent monitoring to ensure its long-term survival, it adds.\nRead more India stories from the BBC:",
    "The EU announced on Thursday that all its leaders agreed a \u00e2\u0082\u00ac50bn aid package for Ukraine, including Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who had previously blocked the agreement.\nEuropean leaders celebrated and Ukraine breathed a sigh of relief. Some saw the deal as proof that Hungary capitulated.\nBut Mr Orban returned to Budapest proclaiming victory too.\n\"We fought it out! They can't give Hungarian money to the Ukrainians!\" Mr Orban posted on Facebook.\n\"We will not take part in the war, we will not send weapons, we remain on the side of peace!\"\nIn fact, the deal represents a major climbdown.\nMr Orban insisted until now that the money for Ukraine should not come from the main 2021-2027 EU budget. He wanted the money divided into four tranches, with an annual meeting at which he or others could veto it.\nInstead, there will be an annual debate, without the right to veto, and a bi-annual review.\nMr Orban's claim that \"they can't give Hungarian money to the Ukrainians\" is dubious, as the EU budget from which the \u00e2\u0082\u00ac50bn ($55bn; \u00c2\u00a343bn) will be paid includes Hungarian contributions.\nAnother detail of the deal which is important to him is that payments to Ukraine will be dependent on respect for the Hungarian minority.\nThis is an important issue for the Hungarian government, which demands that the rights of some 75,000 ethnic Hungarians in Ukraine to study in their own language be restored to the 2015 level.\nHungarian and other minority languages were collateral damage in Ukrainian attempts to reduce the use of Russian in a series of laws implemented from 2016 onwards.\nBut in the end, confronted with a stark choice - to be with the EU or Russia, as put to him by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk - Mr Orban backed down, and chose the EU.\nMr Orban shifted swiftly from one battle he could not win - funds for Ukraine - to another which he would like to be associated with: the current wave of protests by European farmers over slashed subsidies and budgetary support. That could influence the outcome of European elections in June.\nAhead of the summit, Mr Orban made time to meet protesting farmers outside the EU institution buildings.\n\"It's a European mistake that the voice of people is not taken seriously,\" he told Hungarian RTL television in Brussels - a channel he doesn't usually speak to, because it is critical of his government.\n\"Not just relevant to the farmers but to the ordinary people. They are not taken seriously by the leaders,\" he said.\nOne accusation he levels at what he calls the \"Brussels bureaucrats\" is that, in their rush to support Ukraine, they have allowed cheap, allegedly poor quality Ukrainian grain to flood EU markets.\n\"The European Commission should represent the interest of the European farmers vis-a-vis Ukraine and not represent the interest of Ukrainian farmers against the European ones,\" Mr Orban told RTL.\nThis is vintage Orban. He issues a rallying call to his troops - usually hinted at in advance by one of his lieutenants - then the slogan is repeated constantly by his ministers and his media, until the public have learnt it by heart.\nEarlier this week, his former Justice Minister Judit Varga, who will lead his Fidesz party's list for the European elections, posted on X: \"Let's learn to drive tractors!\"\nMr Orban and his Fidesz government hope that like-minded parties in Europe will make spectacular gains in the June elections, and Donald Trump will return to the White House in November. That will change the playing field for funds for Ukraine, despite Thursday's decision.",
    "The suspect in an alkali attack in south London was convicted of a sex offence in 2018 and was later granted asylum after three attempts.\nPolice are looking for Abdul Shokoor Ezedi, 35, who was last seen in north London on Wednesday evening.\nA mother and her three-year-old daughter hurt by the corrosive substance could have suffered \"life-changing\" injuries in the attack.\nPolice have warned people not to approach Ezedi and to instead call 999.\nThe 31-year-old woman and her daughter remain in hospital, along with her older daughter, eight.\nFive police officers were injured as they responded, as were four members of the public who tried to help.\nThe attack took place near Clapham Common at about 19:25 on Wednesday.\nThe suspect attempted to escape the scene in a car but crashed into a stationary vehicle, then ran.\nOne witness described seeing the suspect lift a young child over his head and throw her onto the ground like a \"ragdoll\", telling the BBC the incident was like a \"horror movie\".\nA community worker who knows Ezedi has appealed for him to give himself up, and to get medical help for his injuries.\nAzad, who helps refugees in Newcastle where Ezedi lives, described the 35-year-old as polite and respectful.\nIn 2018, Ezedi was convicted of one charge of sexual assault and one of exposure, before being granted asylum in 2020.\nHe received a nine-week jail term suspended for two years for the sexual assault and, for the exposure, 36 weeks' imprisonment to be served consecutively, also suspended for two years.\nThe Met Police earlier issued an image of him showing facial injuries.\nIt was taken at a Tesco Express shop on Caledonian Road, north London, at 20:48 GMT on Wednesday - about 5.4 miles (8.7 km) away from the alkali attack on Lessar Avenue in Clapham.\nBBC News understands that Ezedi arrived in the UK by lorry in 2016, having travelled from Afghanistan.\nHis suspended prison sentence for the sexual offence, passed down at Newcastle Crown Court, included an unpaid work order.\nOnce that was complete in 2020, Ezedi was discharged from probation supervision.\nEzedi made his first unsuccessful asylum application in 2016. He later tried a second time and said he had converted to Christianity, meaning he would have been at risk if he returned to Afghanistan.\nAfter this second claim was refused, he appealed against the decision and a tribunal overturned it in 2020, having heard from a church witness who said he believed that Ezedi had converted to Christianity.\nThis case is being pointed out by some in the Home Office as an example of the frustration they have with the asylum tribunal system, that people are granted asylum despite having convictions in the UK.\nCurrent rules mean anyone sentenced to more than two years in prison is not eligible for asylum. In 2022, this was decreased to one year.\nHowever, those who work with asylum seekers point out you can still be at risk in your home country - and therefore a genuine refugee - even if you have a conviction in the UK.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesman declined to comment on the suspect's immigration status during a live police investigation.\nBut he told reporters that, more broadly, \"the PM doesn't think that foreign criminals should be able to stay in the country, putting the public at risk\".\nPolice believe Ezedi is known to the family, but said they were not yet clear on their exact relationship.\nAt a news conference, Supt Gabriel Cameron said he had \"no idea\" what Ezedi's motivation may have been, but that he was \"wholeheartedly confident\" he would be caught.\nHe said Ezedi is believed to be from the Newcastle area, and the car left at the scene, a Hyundai, belonged to him.\nSupt Cameron said the suspect was last seen in Caledonian Road.\nThere was a heightened police presence in that area - close to London's King's Cross station - on Thursday afternoon, including unmarked cars with blue lights, and police vans.\nTwelve people in total were hurt in the attack, including five police officers who attended the scene. Out of four members of the public who tried to help, three went to hospital with injuries - two women in their 30s and one in her 50s.\nPolice say they \"bravely came to the aid of the family\" and have now been discharged from hospital.\nThe London Ambulance Service said it sent three ambulance crews to the scene after receiving a call about an incident near Clapham Common just before 19:30.\nA man in his 50s declined medical treatment for minor injuries. Five officers who were injured as they responded to the attack have left hospital after receiving treatment.\nSome of the burns the mother and her daughters suffered in the attack were \"quite substantial\", Met Police chief Sir Mark Rowley told BBC Radio London.\nOne witness earlier said the mother cried \"I can't see, I can't see\" as he tried to help.\nPolice have urged any members of the public who saw what happened to call 101 quoting reference CAD 7790/31Jan.\nOfficers have also asked local reside",
    "The US State Department has approved the potential sale of 31 armed drones, missiles and other equipment to India for nearly $4bn (\u00c2\u00a33.14bn).\nThe MQ-9B Predator drones deal had been announced during PM Narendra Modi's visit to US in June 2023.\nIn December, it was put on hold by a Senate committee pending investigation into an alleged Indian assassination plot on US soil.\nThe deal will now be confirmed after approval from the US Congress.\nIt includes the sale of 31 armed MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones, 170 AGM-114R Hellfire missiles and 310 laser small diameter bombs, communications and surveillance equipment and a precision glide bomb, the Pentagon said. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems will be the principal contractor for the deal.\nAccording to Reuters news agency, Senator Ben Cardin said he had ended his \"hold\" on the agreement for the deal after the US government agreed to fully investigate the assassination plot.\n\"The [Biden] administration has demanded that there be investigation and accountability in regards to the plot here in the United States, and that there is accountability within India against these types of activities,\" Mr Cardin told reporters.\nLast year, the US accused Delhi of plotting to assassinate an American citizen who advocates for Khalistan - an independent Sikh state carved out of India.\nA government spokesperson said the US had \"conveyed our expectations that anyone deemed responsible should be held accountable\".\nIndia's foreign ministry denied anything to do with the murder plot. It also said a high-level inquiry committee had been formed \"to investigate the allegation and address the US government's security concerns\".\nOn Thursday, the Pentagon said the proposed drone deal with India \"will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship\".\nRead more India stories from the BBC:",
    "Judges say the former Justice Secretary Dominic Raab broke the law in the way he increased defence solicitors' pay by less than he had been advised to.\nIn a partial victory for the profession, the High Court said the former deputy prime minister had acted irrationally.\nThe Law Society had argued that Mr Raab had unlawfully ignored an expert recommendation.\nThe Ministry of Justice said it would \"consider the judgement carefully\".\n\"While the claimants were successful on specific narrow grounds, the majority of their arguments were rejected by the court,\" a spokesperson said.\nSolicitors said the cash is essential to protecting criminal justice.\nThe judgment does not formally reverse the government's pay settlement of 11% - but it places huge pressure on Mr Raab's successor Alex Chalk to rethink how much solicitors are paid in the legal aid system.\nLegal Aid pays for lawyers in England and Wales to represent suspects and defendants who cannot afford to pay for the advice themselves.\nIt is a key part of the criminal justice system because it saves court time and generally makes sure that most suspects who should plead guilty to a crime do so.\nAccording to the Law Society, which is the professional body for solicitors in England and Wales, 1,400 duty solicitors have quit since 2017 over long-frozen legal aid rates.\nThat in turn, it says, is leading to \"deserts\" in some parts of the country.\n2022 pay award\nIn 2022, the government awarded solicitors 11% - but that fell short of an independent recommendation that pay should be increased by a \"bare minimum\" of 15%.\nIn a highly detailed and technical judgment, Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Jay said Mr Raab had acted irrationally in failing to ask whether giving solicitors less would still meet the independent review's objectives.\nSecondly, he had not met his legal duty to ensure there had been a proper investigation of all the evidence.\nThe judges said they had received a huge amount of evidence from defence solicitors - material the government had described as \"anecdotal\".\n\"That [description] understates its value,\" ruled the judges. \"The court is being confronted by a mass of convergent evidence from honest, professional people.\n\"What this impressive body of evidence brings home is the women and men working up and down the country, at all hours of the day and night, in difficult and stressful circumstances, carrying out an essential service which depends to a large extent on their goodwill and sense of public duty.\"\nThe judgment does not overturn the legal aid pay settlement, but Nick Emmerson, president of the Law Society, called on the government to act on it.\n\"We are delighted the High Court has recognised that then Lord Chancellor Dominic Raab's decision was irrational,\" he said.\n\"We may have won the court battle but it's the public who will lose out in custody suites and courtrooms across the country unless the government takes immediate action to stop the exodus of duty solicitors from the profession.\n\"This situation will only get worse, with potentially dangerous consequences for society.\"",
    "A police officer who had sex with a woman after she dialled 999 has been convicted of misconduct in a public office.\nJordan Masterson, 28, claimed he was \"powerless\" as the woman was \"in control\" when he was called to her home, Chester Crown Court heard.\nThe former constable, based in Widnes, Cheshire, sobbed in the dock as the jury found him guilty.\nThe judge warned of the \"overwhelming likelihood\" of a custodial sentence.\nThe case was adjourned until 20 March for a pre-sentence report.\nThe trial heard the woman, referred to in court as female G, had been drinking alcohol and was \"emotional\" after reporting a disturbance.\nMasterson turned his body-worn camera off about 15 minutes into his visit to her home, the court heard.\nThe woman, whose children were asleep in the house, told officers the \"atmosphere changed\" when Masterson, of Townsend Avenue, Liverpool, touched her hand.\n'Completely violated'\nGiving evidence from behind a screen, she said: \"How does this happen?\n\"How do you call the police and he ends up taking advantage of you when you're drunk and vulnerable?\"\nMasterson claimed she had touched his hand and said she had left the room while he was on a radio call and returned naked.\nThe former officer, who resigned from Cheshire Constabulary in the summer of 2022, said: \"I remember just being confused, feeling completely numb, like I was glued to the floor.\"\nHe claimed the woman pulled him on top of her on the sofa.\nThe court heard he left after they had sex but later returned to her home, after more emergency calls.\nHe denied \"pleading\" with her not to tell anyone about what had happened.\nWhen he left for a second time, the woman rang police and reported the incident, initially using the word \"rape\" but then saying she had wanted sex.\nAsked in court about why she said she had been raped, the woman said: \"That's the word to describe how I felt.\n\"I felt completely violated.\"\nWhen questioned, Masterson claimed female G had \"been in control and that he was powerless\".\nThe court heard a vulnerable person's assessment form which Masterson completed after visiting the woman warned officers to \"be wary of what this female may do in the future and I urge my colleagues to attend double-crewed\".\nRosemary Ainslie, head of the CPS Special Crime Division, said Masterson's behaviour was \"shameful\" and \"amounted to a serious abuse of the trust which the public rightly have in a police officer not to act in this manner\".\nShe added: \"He knew what he had done was wrong, and then attempted to cast doubt on the woman's account by urging his colleagues to attend her home with at least two officers in future.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Motorists in Edinburgh now face a \u00c2\u00a3100 fine for parking on pavements, as the city council becomes the first in Scotland to implement the ban.\nThe rules are designed to protect pedestrians, especially people in wheelchairs and those pushing buggies.\nBut BBC Scotland News has also spoken to people worried it could lead to problems for bin lorries and emergency service vehicles on narrow streets.\nThe council said pavement parking was a \"persistent issue\" on 500 streets.\nVictoria Watson, 50, who has lived in Regent Street for 17 years with her three children, said she agreed pavements should be clear of vehicles.\nBut she added: \"The council has left us with no solution as to how emergency service vehicles and bin lorries get down the street when cars are parked on both sides of this narrow street.\n\"They have not consulted us or come up with signs or double yellow lines on one side of the road.\n\"They have just slapped this ban on without giving us any suggestions and left us in a bun fight. It is very heavy-handed, ill-thought-out and very irresponsible.\"\nScott Arthur, City of Edinburgh Council's transport and environment convener, said he had faith in motorists realising when they were blocking a road.\n\"Every driver is responsible for parking their vehicles considerately, and where this would not cause an obstruction to the road,\" he added.\n\"If a driver can't park with all four wheels on the road without blocking traffic, we would encourage them to park elsewhere. Neither parking on the footpath nor blocking the road is safe or acceptable.\"\nHowever, he added that officials would be monitoring streets to check if the changes were having a knock-on impact, including traffic displacement or access issues.\n\"If this is the case we could intervene, using available powers, to restrict inconsiderate parking,\" he said.\nWhat are the parking rules?\nCity of Edinburgh Council is the first in Scotland to implement new powers given to it by the Transport (Scotland) Act 2019, which came into effect last month.\nIt begins enforcing the ban on pavement parking on Monday.\nParking at dropped kerbs and double parking will also be banned, with an exemption for delivery drivers.\nNo additional parking staff are being recruited to enforce the rules. Instead, current parking attendants will patrol the problem areas.\nLinda Gariock, 73, said it was not fair for motorists to park on the pavement.\n\"They have to park on the pavement because otherwise no traffic can go down the narrow streets here but I'm very much against it,\" she said.\n\"There should only be parking on one side of the street.\n\"People with buggies and wheelchairs can't get past and they are having to go on the road where they could get knocked down. It is selfish and absolutely ridiculous.\"\nJanis Penman, 74, who travels by mobility scooter, said she felt sorry for motorists and thought more parking areas should be created.\n\"I would not even attempt to go down a street with cars parked on the pavement,\" she added.\n\"I am very careful and look far ahead to make sure I can fit my scooter through.\n\"I find it very difficult to reverse in this as I've never driven a car in my life so I don't want to get stuck.\n\"If I come across a street like Regent Street then I would go along to the next street.\"\nAdam Ramsay, 38, said he has to walk down Regent Street to reach his home in Windsor Place with his young daughters.\n\"My father-in-law lives here and he has days where he can't leave the house because of the vehicles on the pavement as he is in a wheelchair.\n\"It frustrating and not fair on him.\n\"Cars take up a huge amount of the city already and now even take up pedestrian space.\n\"I'm glad they are doing this as it will be much easier for us to get down the street with our children.\"\nTransport convener Scott Arthur said they had already started to see improvements after sending out letters to some of the worst affected streets ahead of the ban.\nBruce McRoberts, 67, who lives in Rankin Road, said his neighbourhood had rallied together to find a solution.\n\"The problem has been terrible here for years but since we received the letters we have a WhatsApp group and only have parking on one side of the street now,\" he said.\n\"It is completely clear now and you wouldn't think there had ever been a terrible problem here.\n\"I used to see people with buggies on the road, it was very dangerous, but not now.

    "A man who illegally dumped 2,400 tonnes of excavation waste on a flood plain has been given a suspended sentence.\nPhillip Taylor, 70, pleaded guilty to operating an illegal waste activity and an illegal flood risk activity at York Magistrates' Court on Friday.\nHe was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to remove the waste to reduce flood risk.\nTaylor, of Scorton, Richmondshire, was also told to pay \u00c2\u00a39,500 in prosecution costs and a \u00c2\u00a3115 victim surcharge.\nAccording to the Environment Agency (EA), waste was transported to land known as the Catterick Complex in Richmondshire from nearby housing developments - unbeknown to the house builders - in 2017 and 2018.\nIt was then tipped beside the River Swale to form unauthorised flood defences to protect commercial fishing lakes owned by Taylor, the agency said, increasing the flood risk.\n'Blatant disregard'\nThe illegal dumping of excavation waste at the Catterick Complex could displace or deflect flood water elsewhere, the EA said.\nThe court heard Taylor had been given \"repeated warnings\" and refused to remove the waste when directed.\nPaul Glasby, EA investigating officer, said: \"Taylor showed a blatant disregard for the law and the community around him.\n\"Building unauthorised flood defences in a flood plain is a serious criminal offence and we are determined to take action to protect flood prone communities and the environment.\"\nThe company which transported the waste to the Catterick Complex was subject to an enforcement undertaking, resulting in a donation of \u00c2\u00a330,000 to the Yorkshire Dales Rivers Trust, it added.\nAn enforcement undertaking is a voluntary offer made by companies or individuals to make amends for their actions.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "The government has scrapped a joint T-level in hair and beauty due to roll out in September.\nIt said it would look at replacing it with a T-level focused just on beauty, which could be introduced \"after 2025\".\nThe Association of Colleges said the announcement was \"a huge shock to colleges who have been enrolling students\", adding that it had caused an \"enormous dent in confidence\" around the wider T-levels programme.\nBTecs and other level-three courses taken by thousands of students after their GCSEs will be defunded from August 2024 to make way for T-levels.\nIt is part of the government's plan to \"streamline further education\" and ultimately introduce the Advanced British Standard, which will eventually replace A-levels and T-levels .\nBut some college principals are worried the removal of alternative courses in the short term will result in a lack of options for students unsuited to T-levels.\nWhat are T-levels?\nT-levels, introduced in 2020, are vocational qualifications aimed at 16-to-19-year-olds , which focus more on practical subjects than academic ones.\nEach course lasts two years and is roughly equivalent to three A-levels.\nThe qualification includes a mixture of both classroom learning and on-the-job experience, with a work placement of at least 315 hours - or about nine weeks - making up roughly 20% of the course.\nT-levels are designed to cater for students who want an alternative to A-levels but do not wish to take an apprenticeship, which usually requires as much as 80% of a student's time to be spent with an employer.\nFinal grades are based on a combination of exams, coursework and completion of the industry placement.\nIn 2023, the overall pass rate for the 3,448 students taking the qualification was 90.5% (3,119) .\nBut figures showed that only two-thirds completed the course (5,210 students began a T-level three years ago).\nThe Department for Education said it was \"quite normal\" for students to switch to different courses after enrolment, and it is working with providers to understand more about what can be done to improve retention.\nWhat T-level courses are available?\nThe number of T-level courses has expanded each academic year since 2020, with a total of eight subjects sat by students in 2023.\nThey include accountancy, digital business, finance, healthcare and manufacturing .\nT-levels in legal services, and agriculture, land management and production rolled out in September.\nThey will be followed in 2024 by animal care and management, as well as two delayed T-levels: craft and design, and media, broadcast and production.\nA third, in catering, has been delayed until \"after 2024\", and a marketing T-level is due to roll out in 2025.\nA T-level in hairdressing, barbering and beauty therapy was due to begin in 2023 but was delayed before being scrapped.\nEducation Minister Robert Halfon said a T-level focused just on beauty could be introduced \"after 2025\".\nHe said feedback from the hair sector was that level-2 or level-3 apprenticeships, or other level-2 qualifications, were \"the best route... for learners to progress\".\nCatherine Sezen, director of education policy at the Association of Colleges, said: \"We have to question why it has taken so long to reach this decision.\"\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan has previously said new courses \"will only be approved for delivery where we are sure they are good enough and can be delivered to a high standard\" .\nWhy were T-levels introduced?\nIn 2020 there were more than 12,000 vocational qualifications at all levels, offered by more than 150 awarding bodies, according to Ofqual, which oversees qualifications.\nThe Department for Education says T-levels were introduced to \"streamline\" post-16 education and make things less confusing for students and employers.\nAs T-levels continue to develop, funding will eventually be withdrawn for some other vocational qualifications.\nBut a report in April 2023 urged the government to delay this plan until T-levels were more established.\nWhen the recent delays were announced, Gillian Keegan said there would be \"at least one year\" between the introduction of a T-level and the removal of funding for similar qualifications.\nUnder previous plans there would have been a two-year overlap.\nOther vocational courses available in the UK include:\nWhat are T-level grades worth?\nT-level qualifications are equivalent to three A-levels.\nStudents get one of four grades, ranging from a distinction* to a pass. Their certificate shows their overall grade and lists their experiences on the course.\nA distinction* is worth 168 Ucas points - the same as three A*s at A-level - and a merit is equivalent to three Bs at A-level.\nFor those wanting to go on to higher education, qualifications are accepted by 134 universities and colleges .\nHave you taken a T-level?

    "Downing Street has said the \"vitriolic hatred\" faced by a Tory MP who has said he will stand down at the next election is an \"attack on British democracy\".\nDeath threats and an alleged arson attack on his constituency office had \"become too much\", Justice Minister Mike Freer told the Daily Mail.\nThe PM's spokesman said no one elected \"deserves to be abused or intimidated\".\nAsked if MPs had enough protection, the spokesman added existing measures were \"robust\" but were \"kept under review\".\nThe prime minister was \"extremely saddened\" that Mr Freer, who has represented Finchley and Golders Green in north London since 2010, \"feels he is no longer able to serve his local community\", the Downing Street spokesman said.\nHe described the abuse the MP had suffered as \"clearly deeply distressing\".\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was saddened to hear Mr Freer was standing down and vowed to do what he could to ensure MPs were safe.\nBut he also called for MPs to \"turn down the heat\" and \"have a nicer politics within the House\" than the \"election frenzy\" he currently saw.\n\"Because in the end don't be shocked if people react in the way that we react to each other,\" he told Sky News.\nEarlier, Sir Lindsay told ITV's Good Morning Britain: \"Politicians want to do the right thing by their constituents, by the country, but we have others who all the time are trying to stop people carrying out the job they were elected to do. It is not acceptable.\n\"I will do whatever I can as Speaker, working with the security, working with the police, working with ministers, to ensure that members are safe, their families are safe, their offices safe.\n\"But that is the big challenge at the moment. It really is a threat. We all get death threats, but Mike really has been targeted,\" he added.\nIn the Commons, MPs from across the House condemned the abuse that had led Mr Freer to make his announcement.\nCommons leader Penny Mordaunt said: \"It is an absolute tragedy that people who come here in good faith to represent their constituencies and do a job they love doing are hounded out of office or have to leave office because of the well-being of their family.\n\"We know that what often encourages others is where they are given permission to demonise members of Parliament, to dehumanise them. Quite often that permission to do serious physical harm and the motivation for it often starts on social media.\"\nIn an interview with GB News, Mr Freer also called for social media firms to take more action against content that incited violence against MPs.\n\"Email and social media have a lot to answer for, because it can be kind of anonymous, certainly social media. Social media companies do very little to just stop it,\" he said.\nLabour's shadow Commons leader Lucy Powell expressed \"profound regret\" that Mr Freer was standing down.\n'Too much'\n\"That any member is forced from office due to intimidation, threats and fear is an attack on all of us and what we represent. It is unacceptable and we must do more to protect our freedoms and democracy, and we stand together.\" she said.\nLabour MP Barry Sheerman said the pressure on MPs was increasing. \"It's going to be a terrible thing if people are afraid to come offer themselves for public office and stand for Parliament.\n\"I recently raised my problems, I haven't had much help or support from the House or even from my own party. We need to do better if we're going to keep this a healthy parliamentary democracy,\" he added.\nIn an interview with the Mail , Mr Freer, who's 63, announced he would not contest the next election, saying: \"There comes a point when the threats to your personal safety become too much.\"\nHe said it was time to \"say enough\" as he could no longer put his family through their anxiety for his safety.\nIn a letter to his local Conservative association , he said it would \"be an enormous wrench to step down\", but the attacks had \"weighed heavily on me and my husband, Angelo\".\nHe said he and his staff had started wearing stab vests after learning he had narrowly avoided being attacked by Ali Harbi Ali, who went on to murder Southend West MP Sir David Amess in 2021 after watching for Mr Freer at his Finchley office.\n\"I was very lucky that actually on the day I was due to be in Finchley, I happened to change my plans and came into Whitehall. Otherwise who knows whether I would have been attacked or survived an attack. He said he came to Finchley to attack me.\"\nHe added that MPs tended to try to \"make light\" of threats, but it remained at the back of his mind that he could have been killed.\n'Kinder campaign'\nHe had also received death threats from a group calling themselves Muslims Against Crusades, and the alleged arson attack on his constituency office on Christmas Eve had been \"the final straw\", he added.\nMr Freer, who has pro-Israel views and represents a constituency with a significant Jewish population, said: \"I don't think we can divorce\" antisemitism from what he had experienced.\nBusiness Secretary K",

It's unbelievable.\"\nFormer Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand described Bradley as \"phenomenal\", while ex-Rangers and Scotland international Ally McCoist described him as \"a breath of fresh air\".\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp also heaped praised on the young right-back, describing Bradley's player of the match performance as \"pretty special\".\nHe joked afterwards in his post-match interview with TNT Sport that a few weeks ago when he was on holiday some Bolton fans had asked if they could have Bradley back.\n\"It's too late,\" he joked.\n'Incredibly proud of him'\nConor's former school, Omagh Christian Brothers School (CBS), took to social media to praise the County Tyrone's native's performance.\nHis former History teacher and Gaelic Football coach at Omagh CBS Pat McNabb told BBC Radio Foyle's Mark Patterson Show he was delighted for his success and he had showed huge talent at an early age.\n\"His attitude, his work rate, his covering of ground on the pitch, his insatiable appetite to get on the ball - everything you see with Liverpool now - was all there then,\" Mr McNabb said.\nMr McNabb said Conor was incredibly humble and even receiving so much praise, would always have his feet on the ground.\n\"I think everyone is incredibly proud of him, a huge amount of credit has to go to his parents and the whole community in Aghyaran.\"\nMr McNabb said Conor Bradley could have undoubtedly made a fantastic addition to Tyrone's senior men's squad.\n\"Undoubtedly he could've made county - he's a loss to Tyrone GAA - but that's life.\"",
    "The Daily Telegraph believes the US is planning to station nuclear weapons in the UK for the first time in 15 years.\nIt says it's seen Pentagon procurement contracts which indicate a new facility will be built at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk. A Pentagon spokesman said the US routinely upgraded military facilities in allied nations and the unclassified budget documents were not intended to disclose any \"specific posture\".\nThe main focus for the i paper is an interview with the former deputy head of MI6, Nigel Inkster. He warns that the so-called \"golden age\" of relations with China, during David Cameron's government, has contributed to the UK lacking the expertise needed to tackle the severe threat from China's intelligence services . He says too few British agents have the level of knowledge or language skills required. \"Russia is the weather, China is the climate,\" he explains, calling China's mass espionage \"strategically far more concerning than anything a country like Russia might do.\"\nThe Financial Times reports that there's a plan to remove first class seating from trains on the new HS2 line as officials look for ways to avoid a drop in passenger capacity. The paper says the planned HS2 trains are smaller than the existing ones that use the West Coast Main Line.

The latter reports her comments that King Charles is \"doing well\" after she visited him following his prostate surgery, while The Daily Mail's headline is: \"the smile that says the King's fine\".\nSeveral of the front pages mark Jurgen Klopp's announcement that he'll be leaving the Liverpool manager's job at the end of the season. \"Jur-gone\" is the headline for The Guardian . The Daily Mirror says fans of the club are reeling after what it calls the \"Klopp shock\".\nThe teenage darts star Luke Littler has given interview to The Guardian in which he quashes the story that he had a kebab after each match in last month's World Championships. The 16 year old, who was beaten in the final by Luke Humphries, tells the paper \"I had a kebab after my first win and didn't have another in two weeks.\"\nFinally, forget mushrooms, tomatoes and baked beans. An expert has suggested the only addition to a full English breakfast should be a slice of pineapple . The Daily Mail, among others, reports on comments from the founder of the English Breakfast Society who says the pineapple was considered a high-status breakfast item in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The paper adds that the group has previously angered some breakfast purists by calling for hash browns to be replaced by bubble and squeak.",

    "A breeder who kept horses in such squalid conditions that 10 had to be put down has been banned from owning more indefinitely.\nJane Moore, 66, of Jemoon Stud Farm in Long Lane, Market Weighton, pleaded guilty to 10 offences of causing unnecessary suffering to 17 horses.\nShe also admitted a charge of failing to meet the needs of 36 horses.\nOn 17 January, Moore was sentenced at Hull Magistrates' Court to 26 weeks' imprisonment, suspended for two years.\nOf the 36 horses kept on the farm, 22 were underweight and most were suffering from dental issues and overgrown hooves, the RSPCA said.\nRSPCA inspector Natalie Hill told how she visited the farm on 14 February 2023 after welfare concerns were raised.\nAn equine vet found one horse to be in such a poor state of health that it was decided to put it down immediately, the RSPCA said. Six other horses were seized.\nIn a statement given to the court, Ms Hill said: \"All the horses were living in extremely dirty stables with little food or water.\n\"Within one stable block there was a very strong smell of urine and the horses' rugs were found to be very dirty and extremely heavy.

    "There is one question Sir Jeffrey Donaldson won't be able to escape now his deal with the government is finally laid bare.\nIt is the question he will be ready for, but will struggle to answer in any convincing way.\nIf he can't sell his deal to many of his MPs, MLAs and lords, how is he going to sell it to the wider unionist electorate?\nIt is now clear he wasn't able to convince almost half of his party officer team.\nJudging by what was said at the executive meeting this week, the officer split remained seven to five.\nLord Dodds, Sammy Wilson and Carla Lockhart are among those within the party who spoke out against the deal.\nEdwin Poots supported the deal, which proved crucial in tipping the balance for the party leader. Executive members were also divided, but we may never know the true extent of the split.\nThey cast their votes in a secret ballot and only a small number of party officers know the result.\nAlthough Sir Jeffrey said he had received a decisive endorsement, he didn't explicitly say the vote was decisive. If it was he would have said, his critics might say.\nBut what is clear is that Sir Jeffrey has the majority of party officers and executive members in his corner, however slim the margin.\nThat means those opposed to the deal have lost the key fight and the party has now moved on.\nFirst impressions matter\nThe battle to convince those outside the party began on Tuesday and Sir Jeffrey had a free run to get his message across.\nIn a clear strategic move, publication of the deal was held back for a day to allow the DUP leader to talk up his wins free from any challenge.\nIt allowed him to stay on the front foot as he toured the TV and radio studios.\nIt also meant his political opponents had no real ammunition to fire at the DUP leader and crucially when it comes to selling, first impressions matter.\nThe DUP will hope that many unionists had already made up their minds before the heavy detail of the deal landed.\nOthers, like the Loyalist Communities Council (LCC), will wait to see the small print.\nThe group was briefed by Sir Jeffrey on Tuesday night and afterwards said it would study the government's command paper before passing its verdict.\nAn endorsement from the LCC could be key if Sir Jeffrey is to win over wider loyalist support; even more crucial will be the support of the Orange Order.\nIts leadership has been fully behind Sir Jeffrey so far, but will that change once the deal is fully digested by the brethren?\nBut the sales pitch from Sir Jeffrey goes beyond what he has negotiated with the government.\nFor him, devolution is the only way to protect the future of the union and unionists should take that on board before judging his deal.\nIt is also clear that the DUP leader views the agreement as the start of a process and not the end, which is evident from the language he is now using.\nHe said the party had \"made progress on the seven tests\" in the agreement, which suggests there is more progress to be made.\nHe also talked about \"banking\" the gains already won in the hope then of getting more.\nThis was the same language used by former DUP leader Peter Robinson when he urged the party to continue the fight against the protocol inside Stormont.\nThat is clearly now the direction of travel for the current DUP leadership.",

I ask the court to take that into account.\"\nSheriff Jennifer Bain KC told Gillman: \"It appears to me that your behaviour was sustained and deliberate.\n\"This is an incredibly serious matter as your actions prevented that significant sum of money from being made available to those with legitimate need.\"\nFiscal depute Sarah Wilkinson told the court that a review of Gillman's benefits was carried out in 2018 and the benefits agency discovered she had been overpaid.\nAn investigation of Gillman's bank account revealed payments from Beaverbrooks alongside the regular benefit payments she was not entitled to.\nMs Wilkinson said it became clear that Gillman - after a short period off work with illness - had returned to work.\nShe said: \"Beaverbrooks confirmed she was employed as a jewellery sales assistant in 2003 and was still employed to do 40 hours per week.\"",

So I knew I needed a wig, and everything changed after that first one,\" Ms Bannister said.\n\"I do have hair now, I just couldn't grow it as fabulous as it is now, so I just love to wear wigs as they are now part of me, part of my identity.\"\nReplies left under a recent social media post include: \"Stupid wig, got something to hide?\" and \"Your wig is a joke\".\n\"I've been online for about 10 years and usually I don't get bad comments, which is why they hurt more when I do, and a lot are about the wigs,\" Ms Bannister said.\n\"They don't know my backstory, they don't know how hard I take those words.\n\"These people do make you feel tiny, they make you feel like you need to stop wearing wigs,\" she added.\nMany people wear wigs while going through chemotherapy treatment for cancer, or after suffering from conditions like alopecia.\nIn Wales, the NHS provides wigs to patients through health boards, which make provision for their supply for people who meet their criteria.

    "Three men drowned off Cornish beaches when no lifeguards were on duty because of the pandemic, an inquest has heard.\nMichael Pender, 63, Jan Kemplar, 30, and Paul Mullen, 56, all drowned between May and August 2020.\nA coroner investigating the sea deaths was told the RNLI was given no warning Covid lockdown rules were going to be relaxed.\nThe Truro inquest heard lifeguards had a moral and social duty but no legal duty.\nThe inquest heard Minister Kelly Tolhurst wrote to the RNLI's chief executive Mark Dowie to say it would be \"notified as far in advance as possible\" of the rules being relaxed - but that did not happen and the RNLI found out at the same time as the rest of the general public.\n'Dangerous environments'\nThe RNLI's lifesaving operations director John Payne said about 1,500 lifeguards were seasonal workers and in 2020 they were not entitled to furlough payments.\nHe said many found other sources of income and they ended up with around 90 full time staff and just 200 lifeguards who were already in training for the start of the season who the charity funded.\nThey were able to provide cover at 15 high risk assessed beaches in Cornwall which expanded to 45 in Cornwall by the end of the 2020 season.\nMr Payne said signage was erected at beaches warning people not to go into the sea if there were no lifeguards on duty, and the charity warned beaches were dangerous environments and people had to take more responsibility for their own families.\nSenior Cornwall coroner Andrew Cox said \"someone needs to take the lead\" in a bid to reduce the number of drownings.\nMr Cox said the beaches where the fatalities happened - Treyarnon Bay, Porthcurno beach and Church Cove - did not have lifeguards on them at the time.\nHe adjourned the inquest to next Wednesday.\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

    "Annual running costs at the Isle of Man's hospice will rise by \u00c2\u00a31m to \u00c2\u00a37.8m by 2026, the organisation has said.\nThe figures feature in a new three-year strategy for the facility, which provides end of life care and supports patients' families.\nThe document highlights aims to expand services, such as increasing staff levels, alongside financial challenges.\nChief executive John Knight said demand for care had risen and funds had become \"increasingly hard to secure\".\n'Careful balance'\nThe strategy covers both Hospice Isle of Man and Rebecca House Children's Hospice and was developed in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders.\nIt said number of adult deaths at the hospice the organisation played a direct caring role in 2023 stood at 427, a rise of 10 from the previous year.\nThe document also detailed how the hospice's annual spend of about \u00c2\u00a36.8m was expected to increase to \u00c2\u00a37.8m over the next three years.\nMr Knight said: \"We live with an ageing population, whilst people are living longer with multiple morbidities, demanding complex care for often longer periods.\"\nOutlining it's future goals, the organisation said it aimed to increase the provision of inpatient beds to 11 in 2024, a number last seen before the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe facility recently returned to offering respite care and reopened its day unit facilities, both of which had been stopped because of the threat of Covid.\nThe new strategy outlines plans for Hospice at Home to be expanded to offer a 24-hour respite care service from next year.\nIt was also hoped an additional team member would be recruited to Rebecca House in 2026, so the service could \"consistently respond to the changing needs of families\", the document said.\nMr Knight said the plan sets out to strike a \"very careful balance between measured service developments, financial sustainability, and a recognition of the changing demographics on the Isle of Man\".\nBut he said growth in the services would be \"carefully planned and launched only as funds are secured\", which reflected the hospice's \"long term commitment to those who have terminal conditions\".\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter ?

    "US safety officials say they have uncovered another problem in cars made by Elon Musk's Tesla: brake warning lights that were too small.\nThe electric carmaker has issued a software update to make the font bigger in a recall affecting nearly 2.2 million cars.\nIt is the latest back and forth between regulators and Tesla.\nOfficials also said they were stepping up their probe of alleged power steering issues.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said there had been thousands of complaints about a loss of steering control, involving 2023 Model 3 sedans and Y SUVs, and one accident tied to the issue.\nThe NHTSA started its investigation last July. It is now going to conduct an engineering analysis, which could lead to a recall over the issue.\nSmall font increases crash risk\nThe font issues were uncovered in a routine audit earlier this month.\nThe voluntary recall for the brake, park and antilock system affects almost every vehicle Tesla has sold in the US. It is free for drivers.\nNo accidents have been associated with the problem, NHTSA said, but \"warning lights with a smaller font size can make critical safety information on the instrument panel difficult to read, increasing the risk of a crash\".\nTesla has faced mounting scrutiny from regulators around the world, as a big jump in production in recent years has put more of its cars on the road.\nIt recalled more than 1.6 million vehicles in China earlier this month over issues with steering software and its door-locking system, while in December it faced a US recall of about 2 million cars related to its autopilot features.\nComplaints about power steering issues have also popped up previously, forcing a recall of about 40,000 cars in the US in 2022.\nTesla has often been able to address issues with remote software updates, unlike traditional recalls which force drivers to return cars to dealerships.\nThe terminology has drawn criticism from Mr Musk, who last year wrote on social media: \"The word 'recall' for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\"",
    "Two teenagers who died after being stabbed in Bristol have been named.\nThe teens, named locally as Max Dixon, 16, and Mason Rist, 15, were attacked by a number of people on Ilminster Avenue in Knowle West at about 23:20 GMT on Saturday. They later died in hospital.\nThe attackers fled from the scene in a car, Avon and Somerset Police said.\nA 44-year-old man and 15-year-old boy have been arrested and remain in custody.\nA vigil was held on Sunday evening where the boys were stabbed, with members of the local community attending to light candles and lay flowers.\nLocal resident Julia O'Reilly was one of the first on the scene after the boys were attacked.\n\"I had Mason's head on my lap telling him to stay with us, you've got help coming,\" she said.\n\"When the police came they told us all to move away which we did, and they tried to sort him out.\"\nShe added: \"I saw this car come down the road. I look back and see Mason, I did not know it was Mason at the time, but I saw a kid get halfway across the road and fall flat.\n\"With that I just grabbed my dressing gown and ran out to be with him. And then everybody started coming.\"\nGoFundMe pages have been set up to help with the funeral costs for the two teenagers, which have raised more than \u00c2\u00a32,000.\nMayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, who attended the vigil, said the whole community had been \"rocked\" and will receive the support it needs.\nSpeaking during a visit to Warrington, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said tackling knife crime requires a \"laser focus\" as he described the incident as \"devastating\".\nHe added: \"We can't carry on with these awful stories of knife crime. We have to roll up our sleeves and do something about it.\"\nBristol Police Commander Supt Mark Runacres said at a press conference on Sunday that a murder investigation has been launched.\n\"There are further suspects that are being sought amongst the group that we believe are responsible,\" he added.\nThe first arrest in connection with the stabbing was made within an hour and a vehicle has been seized.\nSeveral witnesses have been identified and officers are keen to speak to passengers who were on a bus on Ilminster Avenue, at the time the stabbings occurred, Supt Runacres said.\n\"The call was received shortly after 23:15 GMT and within an hour we had the first suspect identified through the linked vehicle and in custody,\" Supt Runacres said.\n\"People had come out of their houses into the streets to try and help the boys, and there are some really heart-wrenching accounts from people on how they sought to achieve that.\"\nFormal identification of the victims has not yet taken place and a forensic post-mortem will be scheduled in due course.\nA police cordon is in place on Ilminster Avenue between Newquay Road and Tavistock Road.\nOfficers will also be attending Oasis Academy John Williams, which both of the victims attended.\nVictoria Boomer-Clark, principal at the academy, said: \"We are all shocked and devastated by the news of the death of two of our young people on Saturday night - lives tragically and needlessly cut short.\n\"Whilst this is not a school-related incident, moments like this impact our whole community, and we are working with our students, and staff to help them process and come to terms with these tragic events.\"\nHigh visibility patrols will also be carried out to provide reassurance to the community while forensic searches and other enquiries are conducted, police said.\nIn a statement, Supt Runacres added: \"[I'm] frustrated that offences like this will take place anywhere. It's demoralising. But it makes me determined to support the community.\n\"[And] it makes me determined to work with the team of police officers we have committed to this to identify those and bring them to justice.\"\nThe neighbourhood policing team will be setting up a mobile police station near the scene and anyone with concerns or questions is encouraged to to speak to any of the officers.\nSupt Runacres said it was extremely important there should be no commentary or sharing of information or images online which could in any way prejudice any future proceedings.\n\"I'd also like to remind people of the impact the sharing of images, footage or even discussing the incident online may have on the families of the two boys,\" he said.\n\"They are already going through the most difficult of times and you may cause them further upset.\"\nA meeting was held on Monday at 12:00 GMT for community members to talk to the police and council.\nAvon and Somerset police and crime commissioner Mark Shelford said he is \"deeply saddened by the shocking and senseless deaths\".\n\"The grief being felt by the families of those boys and the impact it will have on their loved ones, as well as the wider community, is unimaginable,\" he said.\n\"A tragedy such as this, where two young people have lost their lives, is a bleak reminder of the awful consequences of carrying and using knives.\"\nChief constable Sarah Crew said their teams and partner organisations are \"pulling o",
    "Senior politicians from both the Scottish and UK governments gave evidence to the UK Covid inquiry on its third and final week of hearings in Edinburgh. Here are five things we learned.\n1.  Who was playing politics during the pandemic?\nNicola Sturgeon responded robustly to charges that she politicised the pandemic to advance the cause of Scottish independence.\nShe'd never thought about the subject less in her life, she said, than while trying to steer the country through the crisis.\nMs Sturgeon insisted the suggestion she'd seen it as an \"opportunity\" to differentiate her leadership from the UK government's \"just wasn't true\", one of several moments when she appeared tearful.\nThe UK government minister responsible for relations between the two governments at the time, Michael Gove, was also challenged on constitutional matters.\nThe inquiry was shown a paper Mr Gove presented to his colleagues in July 2020, called \"State of the Union\".\nIt contained notes on polling, indicating that voters in Scotland had a more positive view of the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic than they did of the UK government's response.\n\"Absent Covid-19,\" Mr Gove wrote, \"I am firmly of the view that the risk to the Union would be the greatest challenge this government needed to confront.\"\nHe advocated highlighting how being part of the UK benefited people grappling with \"hardship\" brought on by the pandemic.\nTwo days later, the then-prime minister, Boris Johnson, visited Scotland.\nMr Gove, who was a journalist before entering politics, delivered an attention-grabbing line when he observed: \"The political aim of the SNP is to destroy the United Kingdom, and from time to time they will make political points to that end.\"\nBut elsewhere in his evidence, he repeatedly stated his admiration for the professionalism and integrity of Scottish government ministers and his belief that their \"overwhelming motivation\" was to protect the people of Scotland.\nIt seems implausible that Ms Sturgeon, Mr Gove, or the governments they were part of entirely set aside their core political philosophies overnight when the pandemic hit.  The real question for Lady Hallett is whether this made any real-world difference to the decisions they made.\n2. Who was making the decisions in Scotland?\nWas the Scottish cabinet in the driving seat when it came to deciding how to tackle the Covid pandemic or was power concentrated in the hands of a few?\nCabinet minutes dated December 2020 showed that ministers agreed to delegate to Ms Sturgeon the responsibility for finalising proposals to deal with the new Alpha variant of Covid.\nThe cabinet also agreed to give her and her deputy, John Swinney, the responsibility for further decisions if circumstances changed.\nMr Swinney said this was consistent with cabinet having set the direction. He also added said that some decisions during Covid had to be made quickly.\nMr Swinney was also asked whether a message from the national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch, which stated  Nicola Sturgeon wants \"to keep it small\", was an indication that the former first minister in effect expected to take the decisions herself.\n\"The idea of it being a small cast list about who was discussing these points is not one I would accept,\" he said.\nMs Sturgeon also rejected this suggestion, pointing out that cabinet met around 100 times during Covid and that each time detailed minutes would record both the options assessed and decisions reached.\nSo called \"Gold Command\" meetings - involving Nicola Sturgeon, trusted advisers and a smaller revolving group of ministers - which met in the days ahead of cabinet were not, however, minuted, which means it's impossible to know what role \"Gold\" meetings played in decision making.\nMs Sturgeon denied she reached decisions based on her \"instincts\" and rejected suggestions she was given \"carte blanche\" by the Scottish cabinet.\n3. Deleted WhatsApps still dominate discussions\nHow many times did we hear WhatsApp mentioned? The use of the app, what was said in those informal messages, and why they were or were not deleted have been recurring themes.\nFormer Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he deleted his manually. Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, said he had deleted all of his to free up memory on his phone.\nFor Nicola Sturgeon, the question of what happened to hers - after months of press speculation on the subject - eventually came down to one, six-word exchange.\nSenior counsel to this phase of the Inquiry, Jamie Dawson KC, asked the former first minister: \"But did you delete them?\" She replied: \"Yes\".\nShe used WhatsApp with no more than a handful of people, she said, adding that the exchanges were only ever about \"routine\" matters or for \"passing on information\".\nBut the inquiry was also shown messages between her and her senior adviser Liz Lloyd, discussing what Ms Sturgeon should do about what she described as \"a bit of a crisis of decision-making\" on policies affecting the hospitality sec",

    "Republicans have taken another step towards impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his handling of the US-Mexico border.\nA House of Representatives committee voted to recommend impeachment charges against Mr Mayorkas.\nAll Republicans were in favour, while all Democrats voted against. The full House could vote as early as next week.\nIf the move goes forward, Mr Mayorkas will become the first cabinet secretary to be impeached since 1876.\nOpponents of the Biden administration accuse Mr Mayorkas of responsibility for record migrant arrivals.\nMore than 6.3 million migrants have entered the US illegally since 2021.\nOn Tuesday, the Republican-dominated House Committee on Homeland Security met to \"mark up\" articles of impeachment against Mr Mayorkas, a key procedural step taken before a bill advances to the floor of the wider House of Representatives.\nAt the outset of the meeting, committee chairman Mark Green - a Republican from Tennessee - accused Mr Mayorkas of not living up to his oath \"to well and faithfully discharge the duties\" of his office by allegedly failing to properly secure the US-Mexico border.\n\"He has wilfully and systematically refused to comply with the laws passed by Congress, and breached the trust of Congress and the American people,\" he said. \"The results have been catastrophic, and have endangered the lives and livelihoods of all Americans.\"\nMr Mayorkas - who did not attend the hearing - hit back at the accusations.\nIn a seven-page letter released the same day, he said \"false accusations do not rattle me\" and outlined a number of steps taken by the Biden administration to enforce US laws at the border.\n\"The problems with our broken and outdated immigration system are not new,\" he wrote. \"Our immigration laws were simply not built for 21st century migration patterns.\"\nMr Mayorkas also wrote that his parents came to the US from Cuba, which instilled in him a \"reverence for law enforcement\".\nMr Green called the letter \"inadequate and unbecoming of a cabinet secretary\".\nCurrently, Mr Mayorkas is working with the White House and a bipartisan group of senators to tighten border laws, which Republicans have demanded in exchange for agreeing to President Joe Biden's request for more aid for Ukraine and Israel.\nThe deal already looks doomed.\nFollowing criticism from former President Donald Trump, front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, who called the deal a political gift to Democrats, many Republicans have withdrawn support for it.\nEchoing similar Democratic sentiments, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey said Republicans \"know that there's a bill potentially that would give us new law to help us at the southwestern border\".\n\"President Trump and many of the House Republicans are fighting to oppose that because they think it would give President Biden some benefit at the elections at the polling places,\" Mr Ivey said.\nBennie Thompson, the highest ranking Democrat on the committee, accused his Republican colleagues of \"throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks\" by pursuing a \"sham\" impeachment and \"baseless political stunt\".\nIf impeached by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, Mr Mayorkas would be the first cabinet-level official to go through the process since Secretary of War William Balknap in 1876 for his role in a kickback scheme. He was later acquitted by the Senate.\nEven if convicted by the House, Mr Mayorkas is unlikely to be found guilty by the Democrat-controlled Senate.\nWhen asked by reporters on this likely outcome, Mr Green told them it is \"fine, if that's what they [the Senate] choose to do, but I have a duty to do\".\nMr Green has said that the full House vote will happen \"soon\".\nThe controversial move to impeach Mr Mayorkas comes amid rising public concern over US immigration and the government's handling of its southern border.\nA January poll conducted by CBS - the BBC's US partner - suggests that nearly half of Americans view the situation at the border as a crisis, with 63% saying that the administration should adopt \"tougher\" policies.\nImmigration and border security have emerged as a primary electoral issue ahead of the November presidential election, with a Harvard Caps-Harris poll this month suggesting it has overtaken inflation and the economy as the top policy concern among US voters.\nRepublicans, particularly former President Donald Trump, regularly refer to \"chaos\" at the border in election speeches attacking Mr Biden.",
    "For half a century its rusting hulk has risen, whale-like, from the waters of the River Clyde. But what is the story of the \"Sugar Boat\"?\nOn the evening of 27 January 1974 fierce winds were battering Scotland's west coast.\nMoored on the River Clyde, waiting to unload its cargo of raw east African sugar for the Tate & Lyle refinery in Greenock, the MV Captayannis felt the full force of the storm.\nAs gusts of more than 60mph whipped up the river, the Greek-registered cargo vessel dragged its anchor and started to drift.\nThe captain, Theodorakis Ionnis, immediately ordered his crew to start up the engines.\nHis plan was to head for the more sheltered waters of Gare Loch but then disaster struck.\nThe ship drifted into the anchor chains of a BP tanker, British Light, ripping a hole in the hull of the Captayannis below the waterline.\nAs water flooded in, overwhelming the pumps, rescuers set out in small boats to help - among them the tug Labrador and the Clyde Marine Motoring Company's passenger launch MV Rover.\nA Clyde river pilot, Alan Hepburn, bravely scrambled aboard the stricken ship and advised the Greek captain his best hope was to beach it on a nearby sandbar.\nOnce on the mud, the Captayannis listed to port, allowing the the 30-strong Greek and African crew to jump on to the heaving deck of the Rover.\nBut in the morning, as the tide receded, the Captayannis keeled over, never to sail again.\nDisputes over ownership and insurance scuppered any salvage attempts. A plan to blow it up was shelved because of its proximity to the Ardmore Point bird sanctuary.\nThe wreck's location, midway between Greenock and Helensburgh, poses no danger to shipping - so it has simply been left to rust.\nOver the decades, looters have stripped the vessel of its most valuable fittings, but the ship remains stubbornly intact.\nAn attraction for divers and curious kayakers, it is also a haven for fish and seabirds that have colonised its empty hatches.\nIt has become popular as a boat excursion destination, with visitors getting almost within touching distance of the rusting hulk.\nOnce up close, they are often struck by the pungent smell of the bird droppings that have built up over the years.\nThe Captayannis was originally called Norden when it was launched in Denmark in 1946 but for locals it is now known as the \"Sugar Boat\" or \"Sugar Ship\".\nIn Helensburgh, on the northern bank of the Clyde, there is even a hotel and restaurant named after it.\nThe elements are slowly eroding the Sugar Boat but for the foreseeable future, it remains as much a part of the Clyde landscape as the hills that surround it.\nAll images are copyrighted.

    "A skyscraper the same height as The Shard is being planned for London.\nOne Undershaft would reach 74-storeys, according to revised plans submitted to City of London Corporation.\nThe amended proposals include a new stepped design instead of a previous rectangular shape, with the building initially receiving approval in 2016.\nA public consultation has taken place on the proposals, which would see London's highest public viewing gallery at the top of the skyscraper.\nUnder the new plans, developers want to make the building slightly taller, which would make it the capital's joint-highest building at 309.6m (1015.8ft).\nIt would be built between the Gherkin and the Cheesegrater buildings, making it the tallest building in the city's financial district, and it would be constructed following demolition of the existing Aviva Tower.\nThe proposals say it would have an \"elevated podium garden\" on the 11th floor, restaurants and \"flexible cultural spaces\". There would also be two floors of \"education spaces\" curated by the Museum of London.\nSingapore developer Perennial Group and development manager Stanhope submitted a new planning application, having made changes to reflect the decline in office work following the pandemic.\nEric Parry Architects, who are behind the plans, said they had taken an opportunity to reconsider their approach from earlier proposals in response to feedback.\nThe proposed tower had been nicknamed The Trellis for the distinct \"cross-bracing\" pattern on the outside of the building.\nIn a statement, the firm said: \"The new scheme will still be the tallest in the city cluster and retains the upper floors for educational and public access through a collaboration with the Museum of London.\n\"The revised proposals will enable us to deliver a more sustainable building with enhanced urban greening.\"\nIf the amended plans are approved by the City of London in May, completion of the skyscraper is expected by 2030.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Ancient human remains which date back more than 2,000 years have been recovered by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\nThe discovery was made after archaeologists were alerted to human bones on Bellaghy peatland in County Londonderry in October 2023.\nIt is thought the remains could be those of a teenage boy.\nThe PSNI said it is a \"unique archaeological discovery for Northern Ireland\".\nIt explained that the remains had been carbon dated to \"as old as 2,000-2,500 years\".\nDet Insp Nikki Deehan said excavations \"first uncovered a tibia and fibula and a humerus, ulna, and radius bone relating to the lower left leg and right arm respectively\".\n\"Further investigation revealed more bones belonging to the same individual,\" the officer added.\n\"About five metres south of the surface remains, the bones of a lower left arm and a left femur, were located protruding from the ground.\n\"Further examination of the area between the main body and the surface remains located additional finger bones, fingernails, part of the left femur and the breastbone.\n\"A post mortem was carried out by a certified forensic anthropologist and determined that the individual was possibly a male aged between 13 and 17 years old at the time of death.\"\nThe senior officer said this is an \"extraordinary find on a global scale\" due to the body having both bone and skin still intact\".\n'Well preserved'\nInitially police believed the remains could have been more recent as the condition of the bones was so good.\nDet Insp Deehan said that \"little is known so far about the individual's cause of death\" but that, \"unlike some other 'bog bodies', the individual's skeleton was well preserved and also had the presence of partial skin, fingernails of the left hand, toenails and possibly a kidney\".\nThe head of the body is missing - it is not clear if it was removed before or after death.\n\"The well-preserved nature of the body meant radiocarbon dating could be used to ascertain the time of death,\" Det Insp Deehan added.\n\"The radiocarbon dates have placed the time of death between 2,000 and 2,500 years ago.\n\"This is the first time radiocarbon dating has been used on a bog body in Northern Ireland and the only one to still exist, making this a truly unique archaeological discovery for Northern Ireland.\nThe radiocarbon dating was conducted at the 14Chrono Centre, which is part of Queen's University Belfast.\nDr Alastair Ruffell from the university said it conducted two phases of high-resolution, ground-penetrating radar survey at the site.\n\"The remains were discovered at approximately one metre below the current land surface which matches the radiocarbon estimates,\" he added.\n\"In addition, they were amongst a cluster of fossil tree remains suggesting that the body may have died or been buried in a copse or stand of trees, or washed in.\"\n\"This is not only significant because it's Iron Age, but also because of the landscape situation\", Dr Ruffell said.\n\"We are in a series of boglands north of Lough Neagh which are very interesting from where they occur because of how the glaciers moved through here and how humans then arrived.\"\nDr Ruffell also said the location of the find may also have been of huge interest to one of the island of Ireland's greatest ever poets and playwrights who lived not too far from the discovery.\n\"We are in Heaney country, after all,\" he said.\nDr Ruffell said the Seamus Heaney had a real fascination with boglands, writing extensively on the topic and also working in turf cutting for a time.\n\"He would've just been amazed that a few miles up the road from his home that actual remains which he was so fascinated about were coming out of the ground,\" he said.\nJohn Joe O'Boyle, chief executive of Forest Service in NI, said the ancient bog body was discovered on land owned by the Department of Agriculture and it was now working with National Museums NI to transfer it to them so that they can continue with further examination and preservation of the remains.\n\"I hope, in due course, the find will help us all understand better something of our very early history,\" he added.\n\"It certainly adds an important chapter to the historical and cultural significance of this hinterland and archaeological discoveries of bog bodies across Europe.\"\nThis excavation is one of many investigations carried out by the dedicated Body Recovery Team within the PSNI.\nThe team has previously assisted in recovering and examining human remains, including recovering those of missing persons up to almost three decades after the individuals went missing.",
    "The US government has released the names of three troops killed by an enemy drone attack in Jordan on Sunday.\nSgt William Jerome Rivers, 46, Specialist Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Specialist Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23, were killed when a drone hit their housing unit.\nThe US has blamed Iranian-backed groups and the Pentagon said it carried the \"footprints\" of Kataib Hezbollah.\nThe Pentagon also reiterated the US does not want a war with Iran.\n\"We don't seek war, but we will take action, and respond to attacks on our forces,\" said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh.\nCBS News, the BBC's US partner, said it was told by a US official that the drone used in the attack appeared to be Iranian-made.\nThe official indicated it was a \"type of Shahed drone,\" which is a one-way attack drone Iran has been providing to Russia.\nIran has denied US and British accusations that it supported militant groups blamed for the strike.\nThe Pentagon said the three soldiers killed on Sunday morning came from an army reserve unit based in Fort Moore, in the state of Georgia.\nLt Gen Jody Daniels, Chief of Army Reserve and Commanding General US Army Reserve Command, paid tribute to the fallen soldiers.\n\"On behalf of the Army Reserve, I share in the sorrow felt by their friends, family, and loved ones. Their service and sacrifice will not be forgotten, and we are committed to supporting those left behind in the wake of this tragedy\", said Gen Daniels.\nThe drone attack took place in Rukban, north-eastern Jordan, near the Syrian border. The base was later named by US officials as Tower 22.\nMore than 40 military personnel were injured when the unmanned aerial system hit the container housing unit they were in on Sunday morning.\nFeatures of an air defence system were turned off at Tower 22 at the time of the attack, US officials told CBS News, because the enemy drone arrived at the same time as a returning US drone.\nThey added that troops at the air base were still in their sleeping quarters when the drone struck - with little to no warning.\nIran has denied playing a part in supporting groups suspected of being responsible for the strike.\nNasser Kanaani, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, said it was \"not involved in the decision making of resistance groups\" in how they chose to \"defend Palestinians or their own countries\".\nIran's Intelligence Minister Esmail Khatib said that regional armed groups aligned with Iran respond to \"American aggressors\" at their own discretion.\nUS President Joe Biden said the US \"will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing\".\nThe US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said he and Mr Biden would take \"all necessary actions\" following the attack on American forces.\nPentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said the attack was carried out by an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-backed militia and had the \"footprints\" of Iraq-based militant group Kataib Hezbollah.\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed it was behind the attack.\nThe umbrella group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq. It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.\nIn a statement, the group said it had targeted three US bases in Syria - identifying them as Shaddadi, Tanf and Rukban. However, Rukban is on the Jordanian side of the border with Syria. The group also said it targeted an Israeli oil facility in the Mediterranean.\nIt is the first time that a strike has killed US troops in the region since the start of the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.\nThere have been other attacks on US bases in the region, but before Sunday there were no fatalities, according to the US military.\nOfficials said that US sites in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 165 times since 17 October.\nLast month, the US carried out airstrikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US servicemembers were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.\nEarlier in January, one retaliatory US strike in Baghdad killed a militia leader accused of being behind attacks on US personnel.",
    "More than half of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed since Israel launched its retaliation for the Hamas attacks of 7 October, new analysis seen by the BBC reveals.\nDetailed before-and-after imagery also shows how the bombardment of southern and central Gaza has intensified since the start of December, with the city of Khan Younis bearing much of the brunt of Israel's military action.\nIsrael has repeatedly told Gazans to move south for their own safety.\nAcross Gaza, residential areas have been left ruined, previously busy shopping streets reduced to rubble, universities destroyed and farmlands churned up, with tent cities springing up on the southern border to house many thousands of people left homeless.\nAbout 1.7 million people - more than 80% of Gaza's population - are displaced, with nearly half crammed in the far southern end of the strip, according to the United Nations.\nFurther analysis, by BBC Verify, reveals the scale of destruction of farmland, identifying multiple areas of extensive damage.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it is targeting both Hamas fighters and \"terror infrastructure\", when challenged over the scale of damage.\nNow, satellite data analysis obtained by the BBC shows the true extent of the destruction. The analysis suggests between 144,000 and 175,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip have been damaged or destroyed. That's between 50% and 61% of Gaza's buildings.\nThe analysis, carried out by Corey Scher of City University of New York and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University, compares images to reveal sudden changes in the height or structure of buildings which indicate damage.\nDevastation moves south\nThe southern city of Khan Younis has been particularly badly hit in recent weeks, with more than 38,000 (or more than 46%) of buildings now destroyed or damaged, according to the analysis. Over the past fortnight, more than 1,500 buildings have been destroyed or damaged there.\nAl-Farra Tower - a 16-storey residential block in the centre of the city, the tallest building in the area - was flattened on 9 January as can be seen in before-and-after images of the city's skyline. Much of the neighbourhood in which it sits has been levelled by Israeli attacks since late December.\n\"Israeli forces targeted residential complexes, especially in the downtown Khan Younis area,\" said Rawan Qaddah, a 20-year-old resident, who has been displaced and has lost contact with her family.\nShe named schools among the many buildings which had been damaged. Some were now being used to house displaced people temporarily.\nYou can clearly see the level of damage from street level. Once bustling high streets have been left derelict or destroyed.\nThese images show the front of the Shawarma Sanabel restaurant before Israel's invasion, and how the same junction looked in a composite image from January after intense bombardment of the area.\nThe IDF has repeatedly justified its actions by noting that Hamas deliberately embeds itself in civilian areas and explained destruction of buildings in the light of targeting fighters. But questions have been asked about destruction of buildings seemingly firmly in the control of the IDF.\nOne example was the Israa University, in northern Gaza - initially badly damaged shortly before being blown up completely in what looked like a massive controlled explosion. The video was widely shared on social media and the IDF says the approval process for the blast is now being investigated.\nMany of Gaza's historic sites have suffered extensive damage, including the al-Omari Mosque originally built in the 7th Century.\nMr Scher, one of the academics who worked on the Gaza damage assessment, said it stands out compared with other war zones he's analysed.\n\"We've done work over Ukraine, we've also looked at Aleppo and other cities, but the extent and the pace of damage is remarkable. I've never seen this much damage appear so quickly.\"\nDestruction to Gaza's farmlands\nFurther analysis, carried out by BBC Verify, shows large areas of previously cultivated land across Gaza have been extensively damaged.\nAs you can see from the satellite image below, several parts of Gaza show the effects of Israeli incursions and bombardment.\nAlthough Gaza was heavily dependent on imports before the start of the war, a lot of its food came from farming and food production inside the strip. Aid agencies say half of Gaza's population is now facing starvation.\nBBC Arabic spoke to one farmer, Saeed, who fled south from Beit Lahia, in the north of Gaza, in mid-November.\nThe 33-year-old grew guava, figs, lemons, oranges, mint, and basil and earned about $6,000 (\u00c2\u00a35,535) from these crops every year - the only source of income for him, his father and his sister. He had tended to the farm, inherited from his grandparents, for 15 years.\nBut days after fleeing, he says he was told by a relative that the farm had been destroyed by the IDF, along with five surrounding homes which belonged to his",

    "Saudi Arabia has joined Brics, the alliance of major developing countries, along with four other nations.\nThe Saudi membership was due to start on 1 January, but there was a delay before it was confirmed.\nThe Brics group wants emerging economies to have more influence in international politics.\nWhat does Brics mean and who are the new members?\nIn 2006, Brazil, Russia, India and China created the \"Bric\" group. South Africa joined in 2010, making it \"Brics\".\nThe group was designed to bring together the world's most important developing countries, to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier nations of North America and Western Europe.\nEgypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were invited to become members with effect from 1 January 2024.\nA Saudi Arabian government minister said in mid January it had not joined .\nBut South Africa's government since confirmed its membership status .\nArgentina was also invited to join, but President Javier Milei pulled out in December 2023, shortly after taking office.\nThe group sets priorities and makes decisions at an annual summit. Members take it in turns to serve as president for a year.\nThe name for the expanded group has not yet been announced, but may be \"Brics +\".\nWhy does Brics matter?\nBrics countries include major world powers, such as China and Russia, and countries which are influential on their continent, such as South Africa and Brazil.\nThe expanded group has a combined population of about 3.5 billion , or 45% of the world's inhabitants.\nCombined, members' economies are worth more than $28.5tn - about 28% of the global economy.\nWith Iran, Saudi Arabia and UAE as members, Brics countries produce about 44% of the world's crude oil .\nHowever, the group argues that Western nations dominate important global bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which lend money to governments.\nIt wants to see a \"greater voice and representation\" for emerging economies.\nIn 2014, the Brics nations set up the New Development Bank to lend money to boost infrastructure.\nBy the end of 2022, it had provided nearly $32bn to emerging nations for new roads, bridges, railways and water supply projects.\nThis is China's main aim for Brics, according to Prof Padraig Carmody from Trinity College Dublin.\n\"Through Brics, China is trying to grow its power and influence - especially in Africa,\" he says. \"It wants to be be the leading voice for the global south.\"\nThe other major world power in the group has a different purpose:\n\"Russia sees [Brics] as part of its fight against the West, helping it to overcome the sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine,\" says Creon Butler of the London-based think tank Chatham House.\nIran's membership could increase the anti-Western nature of Brics, he adds.\nWill a Brics currency replace the dollar?\nNations often use the US dollar to trade between themselves.\nLeading politicians in Brazil and Russia have suggested creating a Brics currency, to reduce the dollar's dominance. However, this was not discussed at the group's 2023 summit.\nIt would be impractical for Brics nations to create a common currency because their economies are so different, says Professor Carmody.\nHowever, he says it is possible that \"they may consider in the future creating some new currency to be used for international trade payments, or a cryptocurrency for international trade\".\nIs Brics a rival to the G20?\nThe G20 group was set up in 1999 for developed and developing nations to discuss global issues.\nHowever, the Brics group also contains many of the countries which are in the G20.\nIn future, they may work in tandem, says Dr Irene Mia from the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.\n\"Together, they might push for more money for developing nations to tackle climate change,\" she says.\nHow will Russia use its 2024 Brics presidency?\nRussia will host the 20024 Brics summit in Kazan in October.\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said he wants to :\n\"With Brics, Russia will want to show the West that it still has friends and allies in the rest of the world, despite its invasion of Ukraine,\" says Dr Mia.",

    "A toxic mix of oil, chemicals and bits of tyre from roads is polluting English waterways and no-one is regularly monitoring it, the BBC has found.\nHeavy rain forces run-off into streams and rivers. Campaigners say it causes \"absolutely horrific\" damage in places, including just downstream of where The Great British Bake Off is filmed.\nEngland's major road network has more than 18,000 outflows or drains.\nNational Highways runs the network and says it's working to improve them.\nResponsibility for monitoring water pollution in England rests with the Environment Agency.\nIn response to a BBC News freedom of information request, it said that the agency did not regularly monitor run-off, though it did test for pollutants from roads as part of its general water monitoring.\nThe EA said it recognised that run-off from highways and urban areas was a \"serious issue\" accounting for 18% of water quality failures in England, and the third most damaging source of water pollution after agriculture and sewage.\nCampaigners have been doing their own testing and told the BBC they had found micro-plastics, heavy metals, toxic chemicals like arsenic and carcinogenic compounds from car tyres.\nProf Alex Ford, an expert on the impact of water pollution on aquatic organisms at the University of Portsmouth, said that some of the contaminants are known to damage DNA, impact the nervous system and cause cancer.\n\"We don't fully understand the impact these contaminants have as a cocktail but we know they can be toxic to aquatic life and potentially contribute to the poor ecological status of some rivers,\" he said.\nThe Environment Agency can issue permits for activities that have the potential to cause pollution. They set out the limits to the pollution and can set rules the polluter must follow to keep environmental harm to a minimum.\nSewage outfalls have permits and MPs have in the past urged the EA to put permits on outfalls. But the EA has chosen not to saying it \"would not result in reduced pollution\". It did say that it was looking at \"possible benefits of using permits for some of the most polluting outfalls\".\n\"We are working to reduce all sources of pollution damaging the environment, whether they are from our roads, or water and farming industries,\" an Environment Agency spokesperson told the BBC.\n'Bake Off' stream polluted\nAt the River Lambourn in Berkshire the environmental impact of run-off can be seen very clearly.\nA chalk stream, the Lambourn's crystal clear water winds through Welford Park, home of The Great British Bake Off's white tent,  before passing underneath the M4 motorway.\nAt that point it turns brown and murky. Chalk streams are supposed to have clean gravel beds.\n\"Look at this black gunk,\" Charlotte Hitchmough, the director of Action for the River Kennet (of which the Lambourn is a tributary) says as she scrapes a net along the bottom. In the past she has sent samples of the \"gunk\" away to be tested.\n\"There's some really scary pollutants in there. Things like arsenic, lots of heavy metals, lots of things from oil, microplastics from tyres, we can be sure that the road is having a really negative effect on the ecology of this river.\"\nNational Highways has a statutory responsibility to make sure that discharges from its network do not cause pollution. It said this outfall had been assessed as \"low risk\" and was not in line for any mitigation measures.\n'Absolutely horrific'\nJust by the M6 services at Chorley we visit an outfall that National Highways cannot find a record of on their database.\n\"It literally keeps me awake at night,\"says Jo Bradley, a former Environment Agency employee who has now dedicated herself to raising awareness of road run-off.\n\"This little stream should be beautiful,\" Jo says as we look at what the map says is Syd Brook, at this point a murky pool of water topped with foam. \"It's absolutely horrific.\"\nWhen it rains, water from the M6 motorway drains directly into the stream. Jo shows me a plastic bottle full of brownish black water that she gathered during heavy rain the day before.\nHer organisation Stormwater Shepherds has found tyre particles and dust from clutch and brake pads in the water.\n\"Because of the toxicity and the poisons in the sediment I would put this on a par with sewage (pollution) and to be frank, I'd probably put it above sewage,\" she says.\n\"Because they're not being monitored, no-one even knows the extent of the pollution and then nobody's doing anything about it. Nobody wants to talk about this.\"\nNational Highways is aware it has a problem and has been using a computer model to choose which outfalls to tackle. It has identified 1,236 locations that are \"potentially high risk\" and is expecting after verification that about 250 will actually be \"high risk\" and need some form of mitigation.\nUnder its current plans only about 30 of those high-risk sites will have mitigation in place by the end of 2025. A committee of MPs last year called that \"unacceptably slow progress\".\n\"We ",

    "Scaffolders have arrived at Captain Tom's daughter's home as the deadline for demolition of an unauthorised spa pool block draws closer.\nWorkmen have started putting up poles at the site in Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire.\nHannah Ingram-Moore and her husband Colin lost an appeal in October against an order to remove the Captain Tom Foundation building at their property.\nIt was ruled the building must be taken down by 7 February.\nCentral Bedfordshire Council said it would be \"reviewing the onsite position\" on 8 February.\nA workman told South Beds News Agency: \"We are putting scaffolding up today. The pool will be removed before the building is knocked down on Monday.\"\nThe building was named after Capt Sir Tom Moore , who raised \u00c2\u00a338m for the NHS by walking laps of his garden during the coronavirus lockdown in 2020. He died a year later, aged 100.\nAfter the army veteran died in February 2021 his family set up a separate charity in his honour.\nThe Captain Tom Foundation is currently under investigation by the Charity Commission amid concerns his family may have profited from using his name.\nDuring the Planning Inspectorate hearing, family lawyer Scott Stemp said the foundation was \"unlikely to exist\" in the future.\nPlanning permission was initially granted for an L-shaped building in the grounds of the family home.\nRevised proposals for a C-shaped building were then submitted in February 2022, which included a spa pool, toilets and a kitchen \"for private use\" - which the planning authority refused.\nIn July 2023 an enforcement notice from Central Bedfordshire Council required the demolition of the \"unauthorised building\".\nThe couple tried to appeal the order, telling a hearing the building could be used for coffee mornings and charity meetings to combat loneliness for elderly people.\nRepresentatives for the family said the building would enable the public to enjoy the army veteran's work and the spa pool would offer rehabilitation sessions.\nIn November Inspector Diane Fleming ruled the spa had to be it demolished within three months.\nIn a letter announcing the decision, Ms Fleming said the \"scale and massing\" of the partially-built building had \"resulted in harm\" to The Old Rectory, the family home and a Grade II-listed building.\nMs Ingram-Moore and her husband asked for 12 months to comply with the demolition notice, but this request was refused by the Planning Inspectorate.\nThe deadline for the family to lodge a High Court appeal opposing the demolition passed in December.\nNeighbour Lesley Gough, 67, who has lived in the village for three years, believed the family thought they would be \"protected no matter what they did.\"\n\"We were very surprised there was going to be a spa - we were all under the understanding it would be a memorial to Captain Tom,\" she explained.\n\"It's going to be a lot of upheaval for them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They got it wrong and now they're paying the price.\n\"They've lost all that goodness we had, nobody is remembering all the good, it's really sad.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Water companies are forecasting an above-inflation rise in average household bills in April, drawing criticism from campaigners.\nThe average annual water and sewerage bill is expected to rise by 6% in England and Wales, up \u00c2\u00a327 to \u00c2\u00a3473, says suppliers' trade body Water UK.\nIn Scotland, water and waste charges will go up by 8.8%, a rise of \u00c2\u00a336.\nWater firms have been facing intense scrutiny after the dumping of sewage into rivers.\n\"Next year will see record levels of investment from water companies to secure the security of our water supply in the future and significantly reduce the amount of sewage in rivers and seas,\" said David Henderson, chief executive of Water UK.\nHe said companies in England and Wales would invest more than \u00c2\u00a314.4bn in the next financial year, the highest annual investment on record.\nGiles Bristow, chief executive of the Surfers Against Sewage charity, described it as \"a small first step of what will be a very long road to recovery\".\nHe said: \"This is a signal that the water industry is at last, perhaps, waking up to the sheer scale and extent of the sewage scandal and the chronic state of our water system in the UK.\"\nBills can vary\nThe average expected bill is calculated by companies, and will be above the latest inflation rate of 4%, which charts general price rises. Actual individual bills can differ significantly owing to regional variations and usage levels for those on a meter.\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?  Get in touch.\nIn England and Wales, Wessex Water and Anglian Water are at the top end of the scale, with average bills set to increase to \u00c2\u00a3548 and \u00c2\u00a3529 respectively, while Northumbrian customers will see the lowest average bills of \u00c2\u00a3422.\nA host of companies were told by regulator Ofwat last year that they would have to limit rises owing to missing key targets on leakages, supply and reducing pollution.\nOne of them, Welsh Water - which serves the majority of people in Wales - will actually reduce bills by 1% in April.\nThe watchdog has also told suppliers that they must offer help to those who were struggling with bills.\n\"We are very aware, for those who are already struggling, this will be a real worry. As such, water companies must do all they can to protect those who are most in need of a helping hand,\" said chief executive David Black.\nMore than a million households in England and Wales get cheaper bills through companies' social tariff schemes, saving them an average of \u00c2\u00a3151 last year. Around half of households in Scotland receive financial support with water charges.\nFive water companies use some of their own profits to help fund social tariffs, with consumer groups are calling for others to join them.\nMike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: \"Almost a fifth of households say they struggle to pay their water bill and these rises will heap even greater pressure on low-income customers.\n\"If water companies are serious about rebuilding trust in the sector they should use some of their profits to help people who cannot afford another bill rise.\"\nCommenting on why water companies are continuing to use profits to pay dividends to shareholders, Water UK's Mr Henderson claimed they were 3% on average across the industry and had been that rate since the start of the decade.\n\"If we hit dividends you're going to not get investment that we need. Investors around the world can park their money in other sectors and other countries. It is vital that they put their money here,\" he said.\nSeparately, Ofwat is considering proposals by water companies in England and Wales to increase bills by \u00c2\u00a3156 a year by 2030 to pay for upgrades and reduce sewage discharges.\nThe increase would allow infrastructure spending to almost double to \u00c2\u00a396bn, Water UK said.\nBut Jim Wright, manager of the global infrastructure income fund at Premier Miton, suggested that even this increase might not be enough to upgrade the UK's water and sewage systems.\n\"The numbers involved are enormous,\" he told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"Obviously you're replacing systems which in some cases are 100 years old. It is many tens of billions of pounds potentially over the next 10-20 years. Clearly that has to be weighed against what people can afford in their bills. It is a tough dilemma for Ofwat.\"\nThere has been public anger at the amount of sewage being discharged into rivers and seas and continued cost of living pressures.\nThere is also an ongoing consultation into water charges in Northern Ireland.\nMr Wright acknowledged that customers would have to bear the brunt of the cost of improving Britain's infrastructure, but said the average household is paying \u00c2\u00a31.29 a day for water and sewage services.\n\"That clearly isn't a huge amount of money,\" he said. \"If that increases yes, it hits people's pockets, but it is an affordable number arguably if that increases by 30-40% over the next 10 years and if you get the right outcomes from that spending.\"",

    "Tributes have been paid to a British skydiver who died in Thailand while base jumping from a 29-storey building.\nThe 33-year-old, widely named as Nathy Odinson, was a former photographer at a skydiving centre in Hibaldstow, North Lincolnshire.\nMr Odinson died on Saturday evening when he leapt from an apartment block in the beach resort of Pattaya and his parachute failed to open.\nSkydive Hibaldstow said its thoughts were with his friends and family.\nIn a statement posted on Facebook, the centre said: \"As many of you may be aware, Nathy Odinson passed away yesterday.\n\"He was part of the Hib camera team up until late last year, and we hope you will all take this time to remember the fond memories you have with him.\"\nIn response, the skydiving community said \"Nathy\" had always been \"very supportive and encouraging\" to less experienced jumpers.\nOne person wrote: \"Really made me feel part of the family, always had time for a chat about nonsense, or to impart a gem of wisdom.\"\nAnother commented: \"It's heart-breaking that he left us so young, but I hope he's found peace.

That was devastating.\"\nIrwin married wife Jessica in 2016, and they have three young sons Rex, Rafa and Cormac.\nHe told ITV's Good Morning Britain he would film his remaining time with his family so his children would remember him. \"I want it at least on camera, on film, to be able to show them that the early days were brilliant,\" he said.\nFollowing his diagnosis, the presenter said he decided to keep his illness private because he did not want people to treat him differently and didn't want to lose work.\nAfter telling the bosses of A Place in the Sun he had cancer, Irwin said the network dropped him from the show.

    "One of the most striking elements to emerge from Donald Trump's defamation trial has been the frequent clashes between his lawyer, Alina Habba, and the seasoned judge who has at times questioned her understanding of the law.\nAt 39 years old, Ms Habba has risen from a little-known litigator to representing the former president of the United States in some of his most personally perilous cases.\nA New Jersey native, she was born to two Chaldean Catholics who fled persecution in Iraq in the early 1980s.\nAfter graduating from university, she took a job in the fashion industry, working at Marc Jacobs - one of America's premier brands.\nShe returned to college after several years in the industry, earning her law degree from Widener University, a small school in Pennsylvania, in 2010.\nMs Habba briefly served as a clerk for then-New Jersey Superior Court Judge Eugene Codey Jr, before entering private practice, where she worked for several years before starting her own firm in 2020.\nThen enter Donald Trump.\nThe mother-of-three joined his legal team in 2021 after reportedly meeting him at his country club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where her law firm is also based.\nThe former president, still seething after his defeat in the 2020 election and facing a mounting pile of lawsuits, plucked her from her relatively small law firm to serve as his most high-profile lawyer.\nSince then, Ms Habba has risen to public prominence, emerging as - more than any of the ex-president's other representatives - his most vocal defender.\nShe quickly earned praise from the billionaire after her work for him led Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos to drop her sexual assault case.\nShe also represented Mr Trump in his $100m (\u00c2\u00a379m) lawsuit against the New York Times and his niece Mary Trump, and is currently defending him in the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general against him and his children.\nAt the civil lawsuit brought by E Jean Carroll - who Mr Trump was found to have assaulted in the 1990s - Ms Habba frequently quarrelled with Judge Lewis Kaplan.\nThe judge went so far as to threaten her with jail time during closing arguments in the case, when she tried to introduce social media tweets that were not already in evidence.\nAfter a fiery back-and-forth, Judge Kaplan warned: \"Ms Habba, you are on the verge of spending some time in the lock-up, now sit down\".\nThat was not the first time he reprimanded Ms Habba for failing to correctly introduce evidence, calling a recess at one point and advising her to \"refresh your memory about how it is you get a document into evidence\".\nThe judge also repeatedly told her to \"sit down\" or keep quiet during opposing counsel's arguments, throughout the case, and also admonished her for not getting out of her chair while addressing the court.\nHe  questioned whether she grasped the meaning of \"none\", as well.\nAs he denied her request to postpone a court date for Mr Trump to attend the funeral of his mother-in-law, Judge Kaplan informed her he would \"hear no further argument on it.\"\nShe continued to object until he snapped:  \"None. Do you understand that word?\"\nTy Cobb, a White House lawyer during the Trump administration, told CNN that her \"shocking\" behaviour in the courtroom was unlikely to help her client's case or earn any points with the judge.\n\"Embarrassing. That's not the type of lawyering that he's used to seeing and that frustrates him,\" he said, describing her work as \"minor league\".\nShe has clashed with other jurists too, labelling Judge Arthur Engoron - the veteran 74-year-old overseeing Mr Trump's fraud case in New York - \"unhinged\".\nNot that her demeanour has troubled Mr Trump, who lavished her with praise after she managed to get his former fixer, Michael Cohen, to admit he had previously committed perjury on the stand.\nSince emerging as his chief legal aide, Ms Habba has been drawn more deeply into Mr Trump's orbit. She has been known to make frequent appearances at his clubs in New Jersey and Florida.\nFor her birthday in February, she posted a photo of herself seated beside her cake with Mr Trump.\n\"Starting this year off with amazing patriots at the rally in Texas and the greatest President of all time #45 soon to be #47,\" Ms Habba wrote on Instagram. \"The man golfed, went to Texas, crushed his speech and still made time to make sure I had birthday cake.\"\nShe is also a senior advisor for MAGA Inc, the political action committee supporting Mr Trump's re-election.  According to ABC News, she has been paid over $3.5m for her work for the group.",

    "Argentina was once one of the richest countries in the world, richer than France or Germany.\nAnd much of that wealth was built on exports of beef, especially to Britain. But that was well over 100 years ago.\nNow, thanks to a profound economic crisis, it languishes in around 70th place, according to the latest figures from the World Bank.\nAnd a growing number of people here simply can't afford to eat beef from the cattle that still roam the fertile grasslands known as the Pampas.  People like Oriana and Samir, a young couple in their early 20s living in a run-down neighbourhood of the capital Buenos Aires.\n\"It's very difficult,\" Oriana says. \"You're constantly asking yourself - 'how am I going to make ends meet?'. We're the country of beef, but we only eat chicken because it's cheaper.\"\nEven chicken is a treat.  Last year, inflation soared to 211%, the highest rate in three decades. In December alone, prices rose by more than 25%.\nThe family share a small flat with their young daughter Chiara, and also Samir's parents and his brother. Paying the bills is a constant worry.  The costs of food, but also rent, electricity and transport keep rising all the time.\nSamir is a self-employed delivery driver, but the economic crisis means that demand has dropped sharply. His earnings can't keep up with rising prices.\nPlus he worries about growing insecurity on the streets, as people get more and more desperate. \"They might kill you just for your cell phone,\" he says.\nBBC World Service - Under the skin of Argentina's economic crisis\nAt least 40% of the population live in poverty, according to the last set of official government figures. Most suspect the real figure is even higher.\nBoth Oriana and Samir voted for Argentina's new leader Javier Milei, the radical right-wing libertarian with extravagant hair and an abrasive style. He came from behind in last year's election to win more than 55% of the vote.\n\"He understands people's problems,\" says Samir, \"I think he's just what Argentina needs\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to deal with the inflation.\"\nOthers aren't so sure. Claudio Paez used to be a successful businessman with a chain of sweet shops and grocery stores, 12 in all.  Now he's down to just two as the costs of running the shops and the collapse in customers' disposable income ate into his revenues.  And he expects things to get worse, not better.\n\"If the economic problems continue for three more months, I'll be in trouble and I won't be able to cover my outgoings,\" he says.\nMore and more people in Argentina are having to improvise to survive. Not far from one of Claudio's shops, a small van is parked by the side of the road, the boot piled high with trays of eggs.\nThe cheap price, $1 (79p) for a dozen eggs, has attracted a queue. But the van's owner does not linger long, just in case the police come by.\nThe streets of Buenos Aires may still be lined with the ornate architecture of the country's 19th-Century boom, but they're also teeming with street vendors, delivery app riders and unofficial taxis. Analysis of official figures by the National University of Salta suggests that the informal sector employs nearly half the workforce in Argentina .\nAdded to which, few people actually pay any income tax thanks to a law passed by the previous government, just before the election. And that's bad news for a country that's essentially broke and badly needs to generate income.\nArgentina spends far more than it earns, and it already owes eye-watering sums: currently, about $44bn to the International Monetary Fund, making it the organisation's largest single debtor.\nPresident Milei says he has answers to the economic crisis. An economist by training, he's a devout believer in untrammelled free markets and a shrunken state.  On the campaign trail, he garnered plenty of attention by waving a real chainsaw in the air, to signal his commitment to cost-cutting.\nHe also promised to blow up the central bank and get rid of the local currency - the peso - altogether, and replace it with the US dollar. Both those ideas are currently on the back-burner, not least because the government itself is so short of dollars.\nInstead, President Milei has devalued the peso by half to boost competitiveness. And he's slashed the number of government ministries by a similar amount.\nAnd, with a raft of proposals known as the \"Omnibus\" bill currently before Congress, it's now the turn of public spending.\n\"For the last 30 years,\" says analyst Sergio Berensztein, \"we've been printing money like maniacs, which is why we have such high inflation. Now, for the first time, we have a president who understands the problem.\"\nThe only solution, says Mr Berensztein, is to try to balance the budget, something the government's promised to do by the end of this year.  But it's going to be \"rough\", he adds.\nAnd so it becomes a question of politics. Mr Milei may have a clear personal mandate from voters, but he doesn't have a majority in Congress. Nowhere near in fact.\nHis party, Freedom Adva",

    "Lloyds is closing its mobile van banking service this year, after announcing 1,600 branch job cuts in a move towards online banking.\nThe banking group runs the facility as an alternative to High Street branches, with vans visiting towns and cities across the UK.\nIt said the service, which it runs for its Lloyds Bank and Bank of Scotland customers, would end in May.\nLloyds blamed the move on dwindling numbers using the service.\nCustomers can use the facility on set days and times, to cash cheques, withdraw cash, pay bills, send money abroad, or for general account enquiries.\nThe mobile vans stop at multiple locations, but the bank stressed that all mobile branch stops already have alternative options for accessing cash nearby, such as a Post Office, or a free-to-use ATM.\nThe banking giant, which owns Halifax and Bank of Scotland, said it would be introducing 32 more \"community bankers\" in local communities where a mobile branch currently stops.\nThe past few years have seen most of the major High Street banks close branches as more customers do their banking online.\nAn average of 54 UK branches have shut each month since January 2015.\nThe rapid pace of closures has led to calls from charities for more shared banking hubs to be opened to help those who feel uncomfortable managing their finances online.\nThese banking hubs have counter services run for the major banks, often by the Post Office. They also have a dedicated room where customers visit community bankers from their own bank, with different banks visiting on different days of the week.\nThirty-two shared hubs have opened so far, of which five are only temporary.

    "A woman who received a lung transplant as she was \"suffocating with every breath\" credited a system to prioritise urgent cases with saving her life.\nThe UK Lung Allocation Scheme (Uklas) was introduced in 2017, categorising patients by need.\nGeorgie Cooper, 26, of Chelmsford, said being moved to the \"urgent\" list for a transplant made her feel \"reborn\".\nA study of the system at Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge found the odds of a transplant greatly increased.\nThe Uklas scheme was introduced by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT).\nIt categorises patients' needs into three groups - \"super urgent\", \"urgent\" and \"non-urgent\" - and also cuts out geographical boundaries.\nThe study looked at results after the scheme was introduced in 2017, and before.\nResearchers found the odds of receiving a transplant within six months increased by 41% after the initiative.\nThey examined data on lung transplants across the UK between March 2015 and November 2016 - before the scheme was introduced - and from May 2017 to January 2019.\nThey found 461 patients joined the lung transplant waiting list in the first period, and 471 after Uklas was launched.\nBefore 2017, the average waiting time for donor lungs was 427 days.\nAfter the scheme's launch, \"super urgent\" patients waited an average of eight days for transplant and \"urgent\" patients 15 days.\nMs Cooper was categorised as \"urgent\" need and received a lung transplant in 2021 at Harefield Hospital, in Hillingdon, London.\nShe has cystic fibrosis and, by the time of her transplant, was considered just weeks from death.\n\"Before my transplant I was suffocating with every breath I tried to take,\" said Ms Cooper.\n\"I am so happy I could be prioritised for an urgent transplant.\n\"Knowing that if you get sicker, the system adjusts, really helps.\n\"I feel reborn. I am so grateful to the donor and their family - they are my heroes.\"\nHowever, those in the \"non urgent\" category had longer average waits with many waiting for more than a year-and-a-half (585 days).\nThe study found the proportion of people who died while on the waiting list reduced from 15% to 13% after the scheme was launched.\nPost-transplant survival also increased: before the scheme was launched about 81% of patients survived for at least a year, rising to 83% after Uklas was rolled out.\nOne of the study's authors, Jasvir Parmar, chair of the NHS's Cardiothoracic Advisory Group, and a transplant consultant at Royal Papworth Hospital, said: \"The new policy has fulfilled its goals of prioritising the most critically ill and improving the odds of transplantation.\"\nDale Gardiner, of NHS Blood and Transplant, said: \"The revised lung allocation scheme was developed to ensure timely allocation of donor lungs to those most in need.\"\nHe encouraged more people to register as donors .\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "The UN, EU and anti-death penalty activists have condemned the first execution of a prisoner using nitrogen gas.\nKenneth Eugene Smith was put to death Thursday night at a state prison in Atmore, Alabama.\nA journalist who witnessed the execution told the BBC that Smith thrashed violently on the gurney.\nSmith was convicted in 1989 of murdering a preacher's wife, Elizabeth Sennett, in a killing-for-hire.\nThe execution process began at 19:53 local time (01:53 GMT) and Smith was pronounced dead about half of an hour later at 20:25 (02:35 GMT).\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said he had \"serious concerns this novel and untested method of suffocation by nitrogen gas may amount to torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\".\nIn a statement, EU officials called nitrogen gas \"a particularly cruel and unusual punishment\".\nOne of the five reporters who witnessed the execution told the BBC it was unlike any other he'd seen.\n\"I've been to four previous executions and I've never seen a condemned inmate thrash in the way that Kenneth Smith reacted to the nitrogen gas,\", Alabama journalist Lee Hedgepeth told the BBC's Newsday programme.\n\"Kenny just began to gasp for air repeatedly and the execution took about 25 minutes total.\"\nInhaling pure nitrogen gas cuts off the oxygen supply to the brain. The procedure had never been used before in an execution, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\nAlabama officials had said in an earlier court filing they expected Smith to lose consciousness within seconds and die in a matter of minutes.\nSmith's spiritual adviser, the Reverend Jeff Hood, said after the execution: \"I think that anybody that witnessed this knows that we didn't see someone go unconscious in two or three seconds.\"\n\"What we saw was minutes of someone struggling for their life,\" Mr Hood said. \"We also saw cracks in correction officials in the room who were visibly surprised at how bad this thing went.\"\nState officials, meanwhile, said the execution went as planned.\nJohn Hamm, commissioner of the Alabama Department of Corrections, said it \"appeared that Smith was holding his breath as long as he could.\"\n\"He struggled against restraints a little bit, but there's some involuntary movement and some abnormal breathing,\" he told a post-execution briefing. \"That was all expected and was in the side effects that we've seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia\".\n\"Nothing was out of the ordinary,\" he added.\nAt a press conference on Friday, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said he expected the method to be used in the future and by other states. Oklahoma and Mississippi have also authorised nitrogen gas for executions.\n\"Despite the international effort by activists to undermine and disparage our state's justice system and to deny justice to the victims of heinous murders, our proven method offers a blueprint for other states and a warning to those who would contemplate shedding innocent blood,\" he said in a statement after the execution on Thursday.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Friday that the Biden administration found the execution \"very troubling\" and that it would continue to enforce a moratorium on executions to be carried out by the federal government.\nSmith's last words were, according to a media pool report: \"Tonight Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward. I'm leaving with love, peace and light. Thank you for supporting me. Love all of you.\"\nHe also made an \"I love you\" sign with sign language, reporters said.\nSmith was one of two men convicted of murdering Mrs Sennett.\nHer husband Charles Sennett, a debt-ridden preacher, paid them $1,000 (\u00c2\u00a3790) to carry out the murder so that he could collect insurance money. He killed himself as investigators closed in.\nMrs Sennett was beaten with a fireplace tool and stabbed in the chest and neck, and her death was staged to look like a home invasion and burglary.\nAt his trial Smith admitted to being present when she was killed, but said he did not take part in the attack.\nSmith's fellow hitman, John Forrest Parker, was executed in 2010.\nMike Sennett, the victim's son, said the family wouldn't be celebrating but that Smith had paid his \"debt\".\n\"Nothing that happened here today is going to bring Mom back,\" he said. \"We're glad this day is over.\"\nIn a statement, Smith's legal team said it was \"deeply saddened\" by his execution, noting the jury in his case had voted to spare his life but a judge overrode its decision.\nAmerican opponents of the death penalty also condemned the execution.\n\"It's not something that should be done, and yet it was done,\" said Abraham Bonowitz, executive director of Death Penalty Action.\nAlabama tried to execute Smith by lethal injection two years ago, but prison staff had trouble inserting an intravenous line.\nOn Thursday night, the US Supreme Court denied him a last-minute reprieve.

    "The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.\nIsrael rejects the allegations as \"baseless\". South Africa brought the case to the court.\nWhat is the International Court of Justice?\nThe ICJ is the top court of the United Nations (UN) .\nBased in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states.\nIt also gives advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel.\nUnlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide.\nBut its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions.\nWhat is genocide and what is the case against Israel?\nSouth Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, following Hamas's 7 October attack .\nHundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza.\nSince Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 26,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nEvidence submitted by South Africa claims \"acts and omissions\" by Israel \"are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group\".\nThis describes what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians.\nThe case also highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of \"genocidal intent\".\nUnder international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group .\nThose acts are:\nHow has Israel responded to genocide allegations?\nIsrael fiercely rejected South Africa's claim .\nMr Netanyahu said: \"It is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas.\n\"It would murder all of us if it could.\n\"In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible.\"\nIsrael's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties.\nThese have included:\nThe Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people.\nWhat has the court ruled and when will there be a final verdict?\nThe court issued what it called \"emergency measures\" on 26 January. This was a hearing to rule on a number of interim steps which South Africa had asked it to take against Israel.\nThe key request was for the court to order Israel to immediately halt operations in Gaza, but the court did not uphold this.\nHowever, it did instruct Israel to prevent its military from committing acts which might be considered genocidal, to prevent and punish incitement to genocide, and to enable humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza.\nThe court also ruled that it had the legal right to proceed with the genocide case.\nA final verdict though could take several years.\nRulings are legally binding on countries which formally accept the ICJ - these include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable by the court.\nIn 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to \"immediately suspend military operations\" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored.\nWhy has South Africa brought the case?\nSouth Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.\nAnd as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention , it has an obligation to act, it says.\nThe governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.\nIt sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994.\nThe country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages.\n\"Our opposition to the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza has driven us as a country to approach the ICJ,\" said President Cyril Ramaphosa. \"As a people who once tasted the bitter fruits of dispossession, discrimination, racism and state-sponsored violence, we are clear that we will stand on the right side of history.\"\nAdditional reporting by Damian Zane.",
    "Thousands of P7 pupils in Northern Ireland have received their transfer test results later.\nThey were the first results received from the new common transfer test, run by a body called the Schools Entrance Assessment Group (SEAG) .\nThe new examination replaced separate tests run by AQE and PPTC.\nThis was the biggest change to the post-primary transfer system since 2008 when the state run 11-plus test ended after about 60 years.\nAbout 12,700 children sat the new common transfer tests , which were held on two Saturdays in November.\nThe results are being used by 63 schools - the vast majority of them grammars - across Northern Ireland to decide which pupils to admit.\nFor the first time, pupils were also able to view their results online via the SEAG website.\nSpeaking on Friday, Michael Carville, the chairman of SEAG and principal of Regent House School in Newtownards, said the organisation was confident its website would be able to cope with demand.\nHowever, he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme there were two alternative methods for getting results if there were any issues.\n\"Parents can email admin@seagni.co.uk and a team of people will be available to deal with their queries,\" he said.\nSecondly, he added, most primary schools would also be open and available either in person or by phone to assist parents, as long as they had opted not to have the results shared with the school.\nMr Carville said the new process had successfully streamlined the transfer test from potentially five assessments to two.\nHe added that a small number of students, fewer than 50, had received estimated grades due to being unable to attend one of the assessments.\n\"We're quite confident in the estimated score that's being produced, so we think they will have a fair process,\" he said.\nWhat is the new transfer test?\nThe new common transfer test was sat for the first time by pupils in Northern Ireland in November.\nIt was split over two one-hour test papers which had questions based on English or Irish and maths.\nEnglish and Irish were examined through multiple choice questions on spelling grammar and punctuation.\nThere was also a written comprehension test.\nThe maths part of the test was mainly made up of multiple-choice questions.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, the principal of St Caolan's Primary School in Darragh Cross, County Down, said the new system was more \"child-centred\".\n\"Last year they were sitting AQE or GL and depending on which they did, they could only apply to a certain number of academically-selective schools,\"  Sean McVeigh said.\n\"This year by by sitting the single entrance test, all children in P7 can have the opportunity to enter any academically selective school.\"\nMr McVeigh said the test naturally brought up anxiety, which was hard to prevent.\n\"Every child from P1 to P7 is very aware when the big tests are coming up,\" he said.\n\"They don't necessarily know what these tests are but they know there are big results coming up and our P7s are definitely feeling the pressure of this test.\n\"So much so that here in the school we have sat and drawn up an action plan for all the children - to deal with anxiety, to build confidence and resilience.\"\nDespite the change to the transfer test, there remains ongoing debate about academic selection at the age of 11.\nFor instance, a paper from Queen's University Belfast published in 2022 claimed academic selection perpetuated division in wider society in Northern Ireland and \"disadvantages the already most disadvantaged\".",

    "Britain is ready to bring forward the moment when it formally recognises a Palestinian state, the foreign secretary has suggested.\nLord Cameron said Palestinians had to be given a political horizon to encourage peace in the Middle East.\nHe is beginning his fourth visit to the region since being appointed foreign secretary in November .\nThe UK has a responsibility to set out what a Palestinian state would look like, he told a Westminster reception.\nThe Palestinian people would have to be shown \"irreversible progress\" towards a two-state solution, Lord Cameron said.\n\"As that happens, we - with allies - will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations,\" he told the Conservative Middle East Council.\n\"That could be one of the things that helps to make this process irreversible.\"\nThe foreign secretary also urged Israel to allow more humanitarian support into Gaza and said it was \"ludicrous\" that vital British and other aid was being sent back at the border.\nLord Cameron said the last 30 years had been a story of failure for Israel because it had failed to provide security to its citizens.\nOnly by recognising that failure, he said, would there be peace and progress.\nBritain has long supported a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians could live side by side in separate countries.\nBut Lord Cameron is suggesting Britain could give formal, diplomatic recognition to a Palestinian state not as part of a final peace deal, but earlier, during the negotiations themselves.\nAt the same time, there would have to be a new Palestinian authority \"stood up quickly\" with \"technocratic and good leaders\" able to govern Gaza, he said.\nLord Cameron added: \"Together with that, almost most important of all, is to give the Palestinian people a political horizon so that they can see that there is going to be irreversible progress to a two-state solution and crucially the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\"We have a responsibility there because we should be starting to set out what a Palestinian state would look like, what it would comprise, how it would work and crucially, looking at the issue, that as that happens, we with allies will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations.\n\"That could be one of the things that helps to make this process irreversible.\"\nAs part of any long-term deal, the foreign secretary said Israel would need to see all hostages released, with a guarantee that Hamas could not launch attacks on Israel and its leadership had left Gaza.\nHe said a deal would be \"difficult\" but not impossible.\nHusam Zomlot, head of the Palestinian mission in London, said Lord Cameron's comments were \"historic\", because for first time the UK was considering recognising a Palestinian state \"as a contribution to a peaceful solution rather than an outcome\".\nHowever, the idea of fast-tracking Palestinian statehood prompted anger from some Conservative MPs.\nFormer minister Theresa Villiers told the Commons \"bringing forward and accelerating unilateral recognition of Palestinian state would be to reward Hamas' atrocities\".\nForeign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell said the government would not recognise a Palestinian state \"bilaterally\" but would do so \"at a time when it best serves the objective of peace\".\nThe Israeli government has yet to comment.\nOn the ongoing efforts to end the war in Gaza, Lord Cameron said a pause in the fighting was needed now and there were \"hopeful signs\" about the negotiations under way.\n\"There is a path that we can now see opening up where we really can make progress, not just in ending the conflict, but progress in finding a political solution that can mean peace for years rather than peace for months,\" he said.\nThe real challenge would be to \"turn that pause into a sustainable ceasefire without a return to the fighting, he said.\n\"That is the prize we should be looking for, and more than that, not just how you go from pause to sustainable ceasefire, but how you go from there to a set of political moves and arrangements that could start to deliver the longer term political solution,\" Lord Cameron said.\n\"Although it is incredibly difficult, although efforts in the past have failed, we cannot give up.\n\"If the last 30 years tells us anything, it is a story of failure.\n\"Ultimately it is a story of failure for Israel because yes, they had a growing economy, yes they had rising living standards, yes they invested in defence and security and walls and the rest of it, but they couldn't provide what a state most wants, what every family wants, which is security.\n\"And so the last 30 years has been a failure.\n\"And it is only by recognising that failure and recognising that true peace and progress will come when the benefits of peace and progress are greater than the benefits of returning to fighting.\"",
    "On paper, it sounds like a fairy tale penned by a Chinese tennis fan.\nAlmost exactly 10 years since Li Na won the Australian Open to become China's first Grand Slam champion a new, young Chinese player will be attempting to follow in her footsteps.\nWhen Zheng Qinwen walks out onto centre court on Saturday, she will be just the second Chinese player in history to reach a major final.\nWhich means with her will be the hopes of more than a billion Chinese people and diaspora - just a little extra pressure on the 21-year-old, who only broke into the top 10 this week.\nMany of those new fans have lapped up the narrative around the bright-eyed young star, who huddled around a television screen to watch Li Na, the woman who would become her hero, pick up her first trophy for China aged just eight.\n\"She put a little seed in my heart that I also wanted to do that and to be like her... and even better,\" Zheng said of Li's 2011 Roland Garros victory in a Tennis Channel interview last year.\nOrganisers at the Australian Open have also seized on that narrative, staging a surprise meeting at this year's tournament.\nThe Slam published the moment the retired champion sneaks up on Zheng during an interview. Zheng, caught in front of the cameras, is stunned: \"Wow Li Na, big sister!\" she gasps, hugging her hero.\n\"This is my first time speaking to you,\" she says, half to Li, half to the cameras. \"She's so beautiful in reality!\"\n'This could be huge'\nShe may have only become a household name since securing her grand final place this week, but to those in the know, Zheng's been on the radar for a while now.\nLast season she worked with top coach Wim Fissette, who this year returned to Naomi Osaka at which point Zheng reunited with her Spanish coach, Parc Reberre, who co-coached Coco Gauff to her US Open win last year.\n\"We've seen a number of waves of Chinese tennis players who have been solid - by which I mean top 30, even top 20 on occasion... but no one really to rival Li Na until Zheng Qinwen,\" says Mark Dreyer, author of Sporting Superpower, a book on China's sporting ambitions.\n\"But the big difference is she's only 21. Li Na broke through when she was already 29, much later in her career. For Zheng, because she's so young and has such a long career potentially ahead of her, this could be huge.\"\nLike Li Na was, Zheng is backed by major sponsors and management - Nike and IMG.\n\"I can tell you they've been talking about her internally as a potential top five player for at least a couple of years,\" Mr Dreyer says. \"So this has been a long anticipated moment I think.\"\nAfter debuting on the WTA in 2022, she cracked the top 100 last year before reaching the US Open's quarter-final, where she lost to the woman she will meet on the court this Saturday, the world number two Aryna Sabalenka.\nThe parallels to her idol aren't limited to just her playing performance - Zheng exhibits the same bubbly, friendly persona on court that won Li Na fans the world over.\nHer former coach Fissette described her in the New York Times as funny and as passionate about karaoke as she is about tennis.\nShe also endeared herself to female fans in her debut season, after talking about the period pain which brought to an end her otherwise impressive run at the 2022 French Open.\n\"It's just girl things you know. The first day is always so tough and then I have to do sport... I wish I can be a man on court, but I cannot in that moment.

    "A British national was sentenced to five years in jail for spying in 2022, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa) has now revealed.\nThe defendant - named as Ian J Stones - committed the \"crime of illegally obtaining intelligence for overseas actors\", a Mofa spokesman said.\nThe spokesman added that he had appealed against the sentencing but the case was upheld last September.\nThis was only revealed in a Mofa briefing on Friday.\nAccording to an article by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Stones worked in China for four decades with big US firms like General Motors and Pfizer and is believed to be aged around 70.\nHe set up a Beijing-based investment management consulting firm some 15 years ago, said the WSJ, citing corporate records, online profiles and people who know him.\nMofa spokesman Wang Wenbin said the court had \"tried the case strictly in accordance with the law\", adding that Beijing had \"fully guaranteed the various legitimate rights\" and arranged for British officials to visit him and attend his trial.\nStones' daughter told the WSJ that embassy officials and one family member were permitted to witness one hearing but not the actual trial,  adding that none of them had been permitted to see any of the legal documents related to the case.\nShe also claimed her father was healthy at the beginning of his detention but had received \"inconsistent medical care and poor nutrition leading to severe and life-threatening injuries\".\nMs Stones said British Embassy staff have been able to visit Stones every four to six weeks to check on him, but that there have been long periods where they received no news and were not permitted any consular visits.\nIn a statement, Mr Wang added that Stones was accused of \"being bribed into providing intelligence by external forces\" .\n\"The judicial organs strictly promote the handling of cases in accordance with the law, safeguarding the rights and legitimate interests of both Chinese nationals and foreigners,\" he said.\nThis latest reveal comes as China increasingly publicises cases of alleged espionage by Western countries.\nBeijing has also launched public campaigns to raise awareness of foreign spying and has been calling on people to report any suspicious activity.\nEarlier this month, Chinese authorities said they had detained an individual alleged to be spying for Britain's foreign intelligence service, MI6. The BBC was not able to independently verify these claims.\nThe UK government has a policy of neither confirming nor denying claims relating to intelligence issues.",
    "Three foreign-born residents in Japan have sued the country's authorities over alleged racial profiling.\nThe plaintiffs say they have suffered distress from repeated police questioning based on their appearances.\n\"There's a very strong image that 'foreigner' equals 'criminal',\" Pakistan-born Syed Zain told reporters.\nThe lawsuit filed on Monday aims to confirm that racial profiling is illegal and to seek 3m yen ($20,250; \u00c2\u00a315,740) in damages for each plaintiff.\nThis is the first such lawsuit in Japan, according to the men's lawyer, Motoki Taniguchi.\nMr Zain, who is a Pakistan-born Japanese citizen, has lived in Japan for two decades, went to school there and is fluent in Japanese. The 26-year-old told a press conference on Monday that he has often been stopped, questioned and searched by police.\n\"The time has come to rethink the way police questioning is handled.\" he said.\nThe UN defines racial profiling as \"the process by which law enforcement relies on generalisations based on one's race, skin colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, rather than objective evidence or individual behaviour, to subject people to stops, detailed searches, identity checks and investigations, or for deciding that an individual was engaged in criminal activity\".\nAnother one of the plaintiffs, Matthew, who is of Indian descent and a permanent resident in Japan, claimed that he has been questioned by the police at least 70 times since he arrived in Japan in 2002. He said he now avoids going out, Japanese newspaper The Manichi reported.\n\"I never knew what social withdrawal was until recently... I feel like every time I finish work, I'm hiding in my house,\" he said. Reports said he declined to provide his last name for fear of harassment.\nMaurice, an African-American who is a permanent resident in Japan, told the newspaper he has also been questioned by \"regular Japanese people\", including some who have asked if he is overstaying his visa.\n\"Even if we lose... I want people to understand that this is an everyday occurrence, an everyday thing, and that we have to do something to prevent that for the future generations,\" he told reporters.\nThe three men have filed their case against the National Police Agency, the Tokyo metropolitan government and the Aichi prefectural government at the Tokyo District Court.\nIt has come on the heels off a renewed debate on what it means to be \"Japanese\", after a Ukrainian-born model was crowned Miss Japan last week. While some see her victory a nod for diversity, others have said she does not look like a \"Miss Japan\" should.\nIn December 2021, the US embassy in Tokyo warned citizens of \"suspected racial profiling\" of foreigners by Japanese police.\n\"The US Embassy has received reports of foreigners stopped and searched by Japanese police in suspected racial profiling incidents. Several were detained, questioned, and searched,\" it said on Twitter then.",

    "'We're not allowed to swear, are we?\"\nBoth Conservative and Labour politicians might have muttered a curse or two if they had been in the room on Wednesday in Manchester, when we invited nearly 50 voters to share what was on their minds.\nWe did encourage them not to swear, as we will be showing their conversations on BBC One on Sunday. But the sentiments were strong.\nOur groups were upset and frustrated about the state of the country, which was \"in crisis\", \"depressing\" and \"dishonest and messed up\".\nAnd they did not spare the feelings of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak or Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.\n\"Incompetent cretin\", \"dull\" and \" \"not strong enough\" was how some put it. Read on to find who was the target of which hurled insults.\nFor months, the polls have shown Labour convincingly ahead - with some surveys pointing to a massive majority.\nIn Westminster, fewer and fewer Conservatives seem to believe they have a chance to turn things around. There was even a botched attempt to dethrone Mr Sunak as prime minister this week.\nBut that is Westminster - we wanted to hear what is actually going on in the public's minds.\nSo, with the help of the research group More In Common , we invited nearly 50 members of the public to come and share their views.\nThey all came from former Labour seats in the north west of England that were turned blue by Boris Johnson's Conservatives in 2019.\nThey were carefully selected to give a range of views from different political tribes:\nOur conversations, of course, do not give us a scientific report on the exact state of public opinion.\nBut we saw a snapshot of Britain in a Room, hearing from diverse voters - young, old, well-off, and struggling.\nYou can read how the participants were chosen here .\nIf you are of a nervous disposition, maybe look away now.\nWe discovered a deep pessimism about the state of the country - just one person saw optimism for 2024.\nThe top reason for the gloom? The huge increases in the cost of living.\nInflation may have eased off, but everyone we heard from has been feeling the pinch.\nJames, a student, told us that some weeks he can hardly afford to eat. Jean, an NHS worker, has been working nights and taking on extra shifts. Pensioner Barry's fixed income is being stretched and stretched.\nNearly everyone had a horror story about the NHS too.\nCarer Amy told us of \"ridiculous\" ambulance waits when those she looks after need help.\nMichael, a dad of six with a heart condition, has been waiting more than six months for treatment.\nJean claims there are not even enough basic supplies like paper towels or toilet paper at the mental health unit she works on.\nCreating optimism or political excitement in this kind of atmosphere will be a tall order.\nIt is important to say there are some better signs from the economy - which was tentatively growing when the last set of figures were released.\nOptimistic Tories are hoping this becomes a trend. But that sentiment had not reached our assembled voters this week.\nWhat, then, did they make of those vying for their votes?\nEven among loyal Tory voters, hardly anyone in our group believed that Mr Sunak was doing a good job - or even has the right set of skills to sort out the country's problems.\nOur panels repeatedly mentioned the prime minister's family wealth, branding him out of touch and unable to get anything done.\nFirst time voter James, who is planning to vote Green, labels him an \"incompetent cretin\".\n\"It's like he's reading from a script when he talks,\" Lib Dem-supporting Rebecca said.\nWhile Reform UK voter Tracy thinks Mr Sunak has \"no personality\".\nVoters have also taken notice of the Conservative in-fighting .\n\"No wonder he can't get anything done, because there's fighting and bickering,\" Tory voter Sheila said.\n\"I've never known a party like it, ever,\" she added.\nIf there is any good news for Mr Sunak, it's that several voters admired his work as chancellor. Conservative-voting Michael said he'd done a \"marvellous job\" before becoming the prime minister.\nThere was a consensus among every group that the prime minister's task is almost impossible.  And Mr Sunak might not be the right person to do it.\nYou can watch more of what they said here, and hear more about why they reached those conclusions on Sunday at 09.00 GMT on the show.\nBut what about the leader who polls predict will be the next resident of No 10?\nAccording to our groups, Labour's lead is not out of love for Sir Keir, or even party policy.\nUndecided young student teacher Jonny said: \"I don't know what he actually believes, I think everything he says is to try and win the majority over.\"\nIan, who plans to vote Labour, told us he would prefer \"somebody that was either here or there, not somewhere in between\".\nDebra, a business owner who is undecided about how to vote, said: 'I don't look at him and think, he's the one that's going to come and save us.\"\nVoters also still fear a comeback from Jeremy Corbyn's team, despite four years out of power. \"Who'd be in",

    "Just over a week ago, India's federal home minister Amit Shah announced a plan to fence the open border with neighbouring Myanmar.\nHe said India would secure the rugged 1,643km (1,020-mile) boundary the same way in which \"we have fenced the country's border with Bangladesh\", which is more than twice as long.\nMr Shah said the government would also consider scrapping a six-year-old free movement agreement , allowing border residents from India and Myanmar to travel 16km into each other's territory without a visa. He gave few details of how the fence would be built, or over what timeframe.\nBut the move would be fraught with challenges - some experts say the mountainous terrain makes a fence all but impossible. And India's plans could destabilise the equilibrium that has existed for decades between peoples in the border area, as well as stirring up tensions with its neighbours.\nThe move to fence the border - involving the four north-eastern Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram - appears to have come against the backdrop of two major developments.\nFirst, the escalation of the conflict in Myanmar since the military coup in February 2021 posed a mounting risk to Indian interests. Some two million people have been displaced in the fighting, according to the UN. In recent weeks, ethnic rebels claimed to have taken over the crucial town of Paletwa in Chin state, disrupting a key route from Myanmar to India .\nSecond, ethnic violence sparked by an affirmative action row erupted last year in Manipur, which shares a near-400km border with Myanmar. Clashes between members of the majority Meitei and tribal Kuki minority have claimed more than 170 lives and displaced tens of thousands of people.\nThe government in Manipur, led by Indian PM Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has spoken about a \"large number of illegal migrants\" and said the \"violence was fuelled by influential illegal poppy cultivators and drug lords from Myanmar settling in Manipur\".\nLast July, India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar informed his counterpart Than Swe from Myanmar's military-led government that India's border areas \"were seriously disturbed \". He said that \"any actions that aggravate the [border] situation should be avoided\", and raised concerns about \"human and drug trafficking\".\nMichael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, believes the move to fence the border is \"driven by India's perception of a growing two-pronged security threat on its eastern border\".\n\"It wants to limit the spill-over effects of a deepening conflict in Myanmar, and to reduce the risk of refugees entering an increasingly volatile Manipur from Myanmar,\" Mr Kugelman told the BBC.\nSome question the validity of this reason. While Manipur's government has attributed the conflict there to an influx of Kuki refugees from Myanmar, its own panel had identified only 2,187 immigrants from Myanmar in the state by the end of April last year.\n\"This narrative of massive illegal immigration from Myanmar is false. This is being done to support the narrative that Kukis are 'foreigners' and illegal migrants, that they don't belong to Manipur, and lately, that their resistance is getting support from Myanmar,\" said Gautam Mukhopadhaya, a former ambassador of India to Myanmar.\n\"The logic and evidence for this is very thin. Kukis have inhabited Manipur for ages. The free movement regime has been working well for all communities including Meiteis who have benefitted from it commercially.\"\nA senior retired army officer, with experience in the region and preferring to remain unnamed, said the necessity for border fencing was not due to civilian migration but because several Indian rebel groups from the north-east had established camps in Myanmar's border villages and towns.\nFor decades India's north-east has been roiled by separatist insurgencies. The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), a law granting security forces search-and-seizure powers and protecting soldiers involved in civilian casualties during operations, has proven to be controversial. Indian rebels hiding in Myanmar can easily cross the border and \"do their extortion and violent activities\", the officer said.\nHowever, the move to fence the border is likely to meet resistance.\nIndia and Myanmar have historic religious, linguistic and ethnic ties - some two million people of Indian origin live in Myanmar, which seeks greater economic integration through India's Look East policy.\nUnder this policy, India has provided more than $2bn in development assistance - roads, higher education, restoration of damaged pagodas - to Myanmar, most of it in the form of grants.\nMore importantly, the border splits people with shared ethnicity and culture. Mizos in Mizoram and Chins in Myanmar are ethnic cousins, with cross-border connections, especially as the predominantly Christian Chin State borders Mizoram. There are Nagas on both sides of the border, with many from Myanmar pursuing highe",

    "A county's council tax could be set to rise by 10% as the authority declare a \"financial emergency\".\nThe budget crisis facing Somerset Council was debated by MPs in Parliament earlier today.\nThe local authority is proposing a wide range of cuts , including halting funding for CCTV and reducing investment in parks and highways.\nThe council hope to hear back by 5 February if its council tax rise is to be permitted.\nThe ruling Liberal Democrat administration has warned that within months, it could be forced to effectively declare itself bankrupt.\nThe proposed council tax rise is just one of the motions unveiled by Somerset Council to try and mitigate the budget deficit .\nHowever, the local authority needs special permission from the government to do this, as it is twice the maximum rise usually allowed.\nBut there was criticism earlier today from Conservative MPs, who say the council is to blame for the severity of the situation.\nMP Marcus Fysh, who represents Yeovil, referred to last year's merger of the county and four district councils, that was meant to save \u00c2\u00a318m a year.\n\"We cannot get away from the fact that the current Liberal Democrat administration hasn't taken the decisions,\" he said.\n\"It hasn't done the things according to the business plan that had been set out, to make the changes that were necessary to keep the council's finances on an even keel.\"\nAlso attending the debate was the Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Dyke, who blamed the current financial challenges on a combination of reduced government funding and the increased cost of providing social services.\n\"There's huge issues which have been ongoing for a long time now in Somerset,\" she said.\n\"But the issues that we also have to deal with now- inflation, interest rate rises and the huge issue of an ageing population- are making that much, much more difficult.\"\nLocal government minister Simon Hoare rounded off the debate by acknowledging the ongoing discussions within the council, but criticised how the county's local government merger had been handled.\n\"For reasons which my officials and I continue to explore, those savings have not manifested themselves.

    "Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas have been at war since early October.\nIt began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza - the deadliest in Israel's history.\nAn Israeli military campaign has followed, which has killed thousands in the Palestinian territory.\nWhat happened during the Hamas attacks on Israel?\nOn the morning of 7 October, waves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel. Hamas also fired thousands of rockets.\nThe gunmen killed 1,200 people on the day and more than 100 later died from their injuries.\nThose killed included children, the elderly and 364 young people at a music festival.\u00e2\u0080\u00af\nHamas took more than 250 others to Gaza as hostages.\nThe BBC has also seen evidence of rape and sexual violence during the Hamas attacks.\u00e2\u0080\u00af\nWhat is Hamas and why is it fighting Israel?\nHamas became the sole ruler of Gaza after violently ejecting political rivals in 2007.\nIt has an armed wing and was thought to have 30,000 fighters before the start of the war.\nThe group, whose name stands for Islamic Resistance Movement, wants to create an Islamic state in place of Israel. Hamas rejects Israel's right to exist and is committed to its destruction.\nHamas justified its attack as a response to what it calls Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people.\nThese include security raids on Islam's third holiest site - the al-Aqsa Mosque, in occupied East Jerusalem - and Jewish settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.\nHamas also wants thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israel to be freed and for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip by Israel and Egypt - something both countries say is for security.\nIt has fought several wars with Israel since it took power, fired thousands of rockets and carried out other deadly attacks.\nIsrael has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes and sent troops into Gaza in 2008 and 2014.\nHamas, or in some cases its armed wing alone, is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the US, the EU, and the UK, among others.\nIran backs Hamas with funding, weapons and training.\nWhy is Israel fighting in Gaza?\nIsrael immediately began a massive campaign of air strikes on targets in Gaza, in response to the Hamas attack\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's aims were the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages.\nIsrael launched a ground invasion three weeks later. It has also bombarded Gaza from the sea.\nAttacks were initially focused on northern Gaza, particularly Gaza City and tunnels beneath it, which Israel said were the centre of military operations by Hamas.\nAll 1.1 million people living in the north were ordered by Israel to evacuate south for their safety.\nFollowing a temporary truce in late November, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was extending ground operations to southern Gaza.\nTroops reached the heart of the second biggest city, Khan Younis, where the IDF said it believed top Hamas commanders were hiding.\nHundreds of thousands of displaced people from the north were forced to move further south. The IDF also pushed into refugee camps in central Gaza.\nMore than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed, and tens of thousands injured by Israeli strikes since the start of the war, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry . It says most were women and children.\nThe IDF says it has killed about 9,000 Hamas fighters, in addition to more than 1,000 of the attackers inside Israel. It has not said how it came to this figure.\nIsrael says more than 200 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza.\nHomes and other buildings in Gaza have suffered from extensive damage and destruction.\nWho are the hostages and how many have been freed?\nMost of the 250 men, women and children abducted by Hamas were civilians.\nThey included elderly people and those with disabilities and medical conditions. The youngest was nine months old.\nIn Gaza, Hamas hid them in tunnels and fighters' homes. Unconfirmed reports suggest some have been held by other militant groups.\nDuring November's truce, 105 hostages (81 Israelis and dual nationals, and 24 foreigners) were released in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.\nFour hostages had previously been freed by Hamas and one rescued by the IDF.\nThree hostages were accidentally killed by Israeli troops who mistook them for Hamas fighters.\nWhat is happening with Gaza civilians and hospitals?\nIsrael cut off supplies of food, water and fuel, to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages.\nIt led to severe shortages among Gaza's population.\nIsrael has since allowed in humanitarian aid, medicines and limited amounts of fuel.\nHowever, the amount of aid getting into Gaza is well below pre-war levels.\nThe UN has accused Israel of obstructing the delivery of aid, while Israel has blamed the UN for problems.\nIn mid-January, the UN described the situation in Gaza as \"horrific\", with shelters overflowing, and food and water running out. It warned of a growing risk of famine.\nGaza's health system is i",

    "An Iran-backed Iraqi militia suspected of a drone strike in Jordan that killed three US soldiers says it has suspended operations against US forces.\nKataib Hezbollah, which is part of an umbrella group that claimed Sunday's attack, said this was \"to prevent embarrassment of the Iraqi government\".\nThe US defence department said: \"Actions speak louder than words.\"\nUS President Joe Biden meanwhile said he had decided how to respond to the attack but did not elaborate.\nIran warned it would retaliate against any attack on its \"interests\".\nEarlier, it denied US and British accusations that it was involved in the attack .\nThe US has hinted at an armed response that might come in several waves.\nKataib Hezbollah Secretary-General Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi said in a statement on Tuesday: \"As we announce the suspension of military and security operations against the occupation forces - in order to prevent embarrassment of the Iraqi government - we will continue to defend our people in Gaza in other ways.\"\nThe three US soldiers were killed at a base next to the Jordanian-Syrian border by a \"type of Shahed drone\", the one-way attack drones Iran has been providing to Russia, a US official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\nDozens more soldiers were injured in the attack on Tower 22, which was struck while US forces were asleep in their bunks.\nThe US has blamed Iran-backed groups and has not yet conclusively determined that Kataib Hezbollah was behind it.\nHowever, a Pentagon spokeswoman said it carried \"the footprints\" of the group.\n\"Actions speak louder than words,\" Pat Ryder told reporters after the group released its statement.\n\"There will be consequences,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, the US is taking steps to bolster security at Tower 22, where some 350 US soldiers are stationed in a mission focused on defeating the Islamic State (IS) group.\nAdditional air defences are being sent to the base, a US official told CBS News on Tuesday, including a system designed to intercept drones.\n\"Certainly all roads of responsibility lead back to Iran,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner told BBC News, also linking the country to attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement against ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\"This needs to be responded in a way where they understand that we're not going to just continue to play defensive,\" he said.\nHe added that the US reaction would force Iran to \"understanding that this is a conflict that is going to come to their doorstep\".\nMr Biden has been weighing a number of retaliatory options, including strikes on Iran-aligned militia bases and commanders.\nThe US could also target senior commanders of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iraq or Syria.\nIt is also possible that the US will attack inside Iran's borders, a move which is considered the highest possible escalation that Mr Biden could take.\nIn New York, the Iranian envoy to the UN, Amir Saeed Iravani, warned that Iran would \"decisively respond to any attack on the country, its interests and nationals under any pretexts\", Iran's state news agency Irna reported .\nHe also denied reports that several messages had been exchanged between the US and Iran via intermediaries over the past two days.\nIran has built a wide network of allied armed groups and proxies operating in countries across the Middle East. They are all opposed to Israel and the US, and sometimes refer to themselves as the \"Axis of Resistance\", though the extent of Iran's influence over them is not clear.\nThe US says co-ordination is overseen by the IRGC and its overseas operations arm, the Quds Force. Both are designated by the US as terrorist organisations, as are a number of the regional armed groups, including Kataib Hezbollah.\nThe groups have dramatically stepped up their attacks against Israel, US forces and other linked targets since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip in October, in what they say is a demonstration of their solidarity with the Palestinian people.\nMany of the at least 165 drone, rocket and missile attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria, or facilities hosting US troops, since 17 October have been claimed by an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq.\nIn response, the US says it has struck targets belonging to the IRGC and militias believed to have strong links with the force, including Kataib Hezbollah, Harakat al-Nujaba and Asaib Ahl al-Haq.\nSunday's attack, which the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it was behind, was the first to kill US troops in the region since the start of the Gaza war.\nLast month, the US said it carried out air strikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US service members were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.\nEarlier in January, a US strike in Baghdad killed a leader of Harakat al-Nujaba who was accused of being behind attacks on US personnel.\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week th",

We want them to learn,\" added Mr Scott.\nAlfie's grandparents said they still wanted answers and were keen to speak to other families whose loved ones were murdered by their carers.\nMr Scott said: \"Children are the future of society. If we keep letting them down what future do we have?\n\"We've got to do what we can to try and make sure this doesn't happen to any other children - to any other families.\"\nEight recommendations for agencies were made in the report and there is an ongoing investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct into the West Mercia force's involvement.\nSteve Eccleston, independent chair of Worcestershire Safeguarding Children's Partnership, said: \"Aspects of our response to Alfie, both as a single agency and collectively, fell short of what Alfie needed and what Alfie deserved.\n\"For that, I would like to apologise.\"\nThe report had made \"uncomfortable reading\", he said, but the clear objectives and recommendations were welcomed.\nHe said: \"Often after a tragedy such as this people want reassurance that it will not happen again, and sadly we just cannot give that reassurance because we are dealing with people who mean harm to children.\"\nAlfie's was a \"rare case\" where individuals were intent on causing harm, he added.\n\"On a day-to-day basis all around the country hundreds, if not thousands, of cases are going on,\" he said.\n\"That doesn't mean",

    "Police officers made \"sickening\" comments about an assault victim while watching body-worn video showing her groin, the BBC has learned.\nThe woman's body was exposed when she was filmed suffering from a seizure. Three Thames Valley Police PCs later watched the footage without reason.\nNone of the officers faced a misconduct hearing but a student officer who reported them was later dismissed.\nThe force says the remarks were \"unacceptable\" and PCs were sanctioned.\nWarning: story contains language that may offend\nThe policing regulator says Thames Valley Police should have reported the case for independent scrutiny. The force has now done so, following our investigation.\nLast year the BBC revealed that police forces have misused body-worn video , with officers switching off cameras, deleting footage and sharing videos on WhatsApp.\nIn our latest investigation we found:\nThe BBC's previous findings about camera misuse were \"truly shocking\" and have already led to forces tightening up systems to prevent the deletion of footage, the chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, Donna Jones said.\nShe now wants mandatory rules for camera use which officers would be obliged to comply with.\n'Sickening comments'\nThe latest incident - in Newbury, Berkshire - came to light because of the actions of a student officer, who we are calling Faisal to protect his identity. He had been called to a report of a fight while patrolling the town centre late at night last year.\nThe woman was arrested, handcuffed and placed in a police van by Faisal and two colleagues - a female PC and his male tutor, also a PC - after officers believed she had committed an assault.\nOn the way to the police station, the woman suffered a seizure which left her chest and groin exposed. The moment was recorded on officer body-worn video and the police van was redirected to hospital where she was \"street bailed\", meaning the officers left her there to be treated.\nThe next day, Faisal says, the female PC told him and his tutor she was cancelling the bail and taking no further action because CCTV of the fight showed that the woman had in fact been a victim of assault.\nLater that shift, the female officer began viewing body-worn video of the woman's journey inside the van while at her desk in Newbury Police Station. Three male colleagues, including the tutor, gathered around her laptop and watched the footage while making \"sickening\" comments about her - according to Faisal, who was also in the room.\nHis witness statement, which we have seen, records the types of comments made by colleagues. He reports his tutor saying the woman had \"crusty\" or \"manky\" breasts, while another officer asked to see her \"minge\".\nA fourth male colleague also joined a discussion about how much money officers would need to be paid to have sex with her. One suggested \u00c2\u00a3500,000, another said \u00c2\u00a3250.\nFaisal says officers referred to the woman by name and were clearly aware of her identity - and watched the footage despite the female PC's decision that charges would not be brought.\n\"I just thought: 'This is a victim of crime, a person who we know to be vulnerable.' How can you talk about someone like that?\"\nThe BBC spent months trying to find the woman. When we finally spoke to her, she said the force had not told her what had happened at the time. She told the BBC she wanted the public to know how officers had behaved.\n\"It makes me feel betrayed,\" she says. \"The police are supposed to be the people you go to when you need help.\"\nShe believes officers should have been arrested - and the force investigated to find out if officers behave like this routinely.\n'Disgrace'\nFaisal says he felt obliged to report the officers' behaviour - even if he believed the culture in the force meant it would cost him his job.\n\"The fact I had to weigh up reporting what I saw against keeping my career is a disgrace,\" he says.\nFollowing his report, an investigation was launched by Thames Valley Police's professional standards department.\nFaisal says he was immediately \"shunned\" by colleagues and expected to leave. A sergeant showed him job adverts outside policing.\nIn August, he was told he was not physically or mentally \"fitted\" to be a police constable and dismissed.\nDo you have more information about this story?\nYou can reach Noel directly and securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +44 7809 334720 or by email at noel.titheradge@bbc.co.uk\nFaisal is insistent that the only failing he was ever criticised for was his first-ever arrest - when he agreed to momentarily release a suspect's handcuffs on the express advice of a senior colleague.\n\"I was dismissed for reporting misconduct - there's no doubt in my mind,\" he says.\nThe BBC has learned that none of the officers involved in the incident faced misconduct hearings - which would have been held in public.\nFaisal believes the force acted deliberately to preserve its reputation.\n\"If I'd ignored what I saw that would have made me a corrup",
    "A married couple died in a house fire, the cause of which remains a mystery, an inquest has heard.\nDavid Bowen Edwards, 60, was the main carer for his wife Margaret Eleanor Edwards, 55, who had mobility issues and slept downstairs in a medical bed.\nThe couple - described as being devoted to each other - were found dead at home in St Dogmaels, Pembrokeshire, in the early hours of 11 December 2022.\nThe inquest heard an investigator could not be certain what started the fire.\nA hearing in Haverfordwest was told the couple met 35 years ago and had been married for 18 years.\nPolice were called to their small terraced house on a narrow street in St Dogmaels which was said to be \"well alight\".\nCoroner's officer, PC James Lang-Ford said flames were coming through the roof and police had to force the front door open.\nMrs Edwards was found in an armchair and was pronounced dead just after 02:30 after unsuccessful attempts at CPR.\nHer husband's body was recovered a few hours later from a downstairs room - it is believed the bed containing Mr Edwards fell from the first floor as it collapsed.\nA post-mortem examination found Mr Edwards died as the result of burns while his wife died as the result of carbon monoxide poisoning.\nA fire investigation report, read by fire scene investigator Stephen Christopher Rowlands, said it was a \"very, very cold evening\" and the retained crew responded \"slower than normal\" because of the conditions.\nCrews managed to make it to the first floor, but had to withdraw because of the ferocity of the fire shortly before the floor collapsed.\nMr Rowlands explained that a finger tip search was carried out and a number of items were examined, including cable reels, hair straighteners, and the gas supply.\nThere was no evidence of smoking as a cause and Mr Rowlands concluded that it was likely that the fire started in the downstairs bedroom but \"couldn't say with 100% certainty what started the fire\".\nAssistant coroner Gareth Lewis told the inquest that the carbon monoxide levels in Mrs Edwards' blood were 90.1 - anything over 50 is normally fatal.\nHe concluded that both Mr and Mrs Edwards died as the result of an accident in their home.\nMr Lewis added that there was some evidence of a \"lack of servicing and maintenance\" of the mechanical bed and mattress provided to Mrs Edwards by Pembrokeshire Community Equipment Service, and that there would be improved monitoring of the equipment in future.",

    "South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma has been suspended from the party he once led, after refusing to vote for it and launching a rival organisation.\nThe governing African National Congress (ANC) announced its decision on Monday.\n\"Zuma and others whose conduct is in conflict with our values and principles, will find themselves outside the African National Congress,\" said Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula.\nMr Zuma's nine years as president, from 2009, were dogged by scandal.\nAn official inquiry said the former president placed the interests of corrupt associates ahead of those of his country , in a process known as \"state capture\". After he left office, he was jailed in 2021 for not appearing at the inquiry.\nHe also faces corruption charges over a 1999 arms deal. He denies wrongdoing in all cases.\nDespite these issues, the ANC had tolerated Mr Zuma, but the creation of a new party that may pose a threat was deemed a step too far.\nThe party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), meaning \"spear of the nation\", shares a name with the ANC's former armed wing he once served in.\nIn a scathing letter, Mr Zuma's former ANC bedfellows accuse him of debasing the \"proud history of armed struggle against the apartheid regime\" through the \"opportunistic use of military symbolism\".\nThey also say MK only exists to \"erode the support base of the ANC\".\nSouth Africa's current President, Cyril Ramaphosa, replaced then-President Zuma in 2018 and promised to clean up government. He now leads an embattled ANC into this year's general election.\n'Rescue' mission\nAt MK's official launch in December, a statement was read on Mr Zuma's behalf saying he would \"die a member of the ANC\" but not vote for it, adding that some of its leaders behave in an \"un-ANC manner\" and it was now his mission to \"rescue\" the \"once-great movement\".\nMr Zuma has also launched highly personal attacks on his successor , and former deputy, Mr Ramaphosa.\nThe BBC's Daniel de Simone in Johannesburg says many South Africans see Mr Zuma as representing what is wrong with the recent past, and as having tainted the ANC.\nYet he commands huge loyalty from some quarters. Thousands of South Africans rioted in protest at his 2021 jailing for contempt of court , and a recent poll estimates that almost one in three South Africans approve of him .\nIt is not yet clear how far this will translate into popular support for his new MK party at the ballot box, but it is likely to cost the ANC votes.\nThe ANC, which had its roots in the liberation struggle against apartheid, has governed South Africa ever since white-minority rule ended in 1994.\nMr Zuma, 81, had been a lifelong member of the ANC.\nHe joined aged 17 with no formal schooling and soon rose through the ranks of the ANC's military and intelligence wings, followed by top posts in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal and ultimately the deputy presidency and presidency.\nCorrespondents say this year's election is viewed by many as the most competitive since the ANC came to power in 1994.\nMore about South Africa and Jacob Zuma:",
    "A \"wartime mentality\" is required to improve the lives of tenants and tackle the backlog of housing repairs in Birmingham, campaigners have said.\nBirmingham Fair Housing Campaign said was continuing to receive calls from families battling mould and damp, despite assurances from council bosses ongoing issues would be prioritised.\nThe city council said \u00c2\u00a31.4bn was ringfenced to tackle the issue.\nBut tenants fear the city's financial woes will slow the process down.\nBirmingham City Council issued a section 114 notice in 2023 , effectively declaring itself bankrupt, and has warned that will mean services will have to be cut back.\nHowever, it still hopes to spend \u00c2\u00a35bn on its housing over the next 30 years, funded through rent and reserves.\nVicky McLaughlin, a mother-of-three from Northfield, has been living in a two-bedroom council house for 12 years and said she had repeatedly complained about the conditions and overcrowding.\nHer three sons, aged between five and 12, are sleeping in the same room.\nMould on ceilings and windowsills was treated by contractors in 2022, but it has returned and Ms McLaughlin said her children had suffered poor health.\nShe said: \"When the children were babies they had eczema. My youngest son was hospitalised for two days recently because his skin got badly infected.\"\nMs McLaughlin said they now also have asthma now and that she has doctors' letters to confirm the damp does not help their health.\n\"I have to clean the mould regularly but with me touching the damp, it affects my chest. You just can't sleep either,\" she added.\nIn Sutton Coldfield, Nikki Costelloe and her four children are living in a two-bedroom council flat on the fourth floor of a tower block.\nOn the day she spoke to the BBC about conditions inside, the lift had broken, leaving her to bring her disabled daughter down the steps.\n\"Living here is a nightmare for me and my children,\" she said.\n\"My daughter doesn't walk and is non verbal, it's not good quality of life. I've got two children in my bedroom and two in another. The council aren't doing anything to help me. I'm not a priority.\"\nClare Caudery from Birmingham Fair Housing campaign said: \"These experiences sadly are increasingly common.\"\nBut she said she felt reassured after a \"positive\" meeting with the city council leadership team in the autumn, believing problems across the social housing sector were being addressed.\n\"We felt that they genuinely want change,\" she said.\n\"They are aware there is a huge problem in the city, but it's going to require a monumental effort - a wartime mentality - to repair and build new homes.\"\nBirmingham City Council has said its overall housing budget will require savings of \u00c2\u00a35.6m this financial year.\nHowever, it said further investment was possible through ringfenced funding and an increase in rent for tenants and leaseholders of 7.7%.\nThe local authority said it would look to spend \u00c2\u00a31.4bn over eight years to improve conditions and will continue to build affordable social housing with the support of its partners, such as housing associations and the West Midlands Combined Authority.\nJayne Francis, the councillor responsible for housing and homelessness, said she would prioritise investment in the council's existing council house stock, so the quality of residents' homes \"can be improved as quickly as possible\".\nShe also said: \"Widespread investment is needed as four out of five homes in our housing stock is over 50 years old.\n\"Existing tenants and leaseholders will see significant improvements in their accommodation - these improvements will cut energy bills and make them safer and warmer.\"\nThe council is under continued pressure to take action to improve homes.\nLast year, the Social Housing Regulator identified a series of serious failures following an inspection .\nA spokesperson said the body was continuing to \"engage intensively\" with council officers and commissioners to fix the problems they found.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Parents are being urged to heed advice on co-sleeping with babies after new infant death figures were released.\nBBC News has learned that more than a quarter of infant deaths investigated in Scotland last year involved co-sleeping.\nThe NHS no longer tells parents never to bedshare with their babies but focuses advice on doing so more safely.\nThe solicitor general said the figures suggested some babies were dying in \"high-risk\" co-sleeping situations.\nThe Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) has for the first time tracked the number of babies who died while co-sleeping with parents, following concerns identified as a result of its investigations.\nDuring 2023 it received reports of 74 deaths of babies under the age of 18 months.\nOf those, it identified 19 babies who died while co-sleeping. In a number of cases the parent or carer had consumed alcohol or drugs.\nNHS Scotland no longer urges parents never to bedshare with babies, accepting that some parents will do so, but it offers advice on making it safer.\nIt says babies should be placed on their backs, in smoke free-spaces, on firm mattresses with pillows and bedding cleared out of the way to prevent suffocation or overheating.\nParents are still told they should not share a bed with their baby if they smoke, have taken alcohol, drugs or medicines that cause drowsiness or if the infant is underweight. They are also told never to co-sleep in armchairs or on sofas.\nOne mother whose baby died after they both fell asleep has shared her story with BBC News in the hope of raising awareness.\nDawn Fernand, 33, from Forfar, lost her daughter Fern in November 2014 when she was seven weeks old.\nFern had slept in a moses basket during the night but they fell asleep together after an early morning feed.\n\"Then when I woke up, I realised that she wasn't breathing,\" she said.\n\"So at that point, absolute panic set in, an ambulance was called and her dad started CPR straight away but of course it was too late.\"\nDawn described it as \"the biggest rollercoaster I have and will ever go through in my life\".\n\"You are in shock. You are numb. I remember my entire chest, it literally feels like you are getting torn apart.\n\"I lost part of me, and you physically feel the pain of losing that part of you. I will grieve forever. \"\nThere were no alcohol or drugs involved in Fern's death. Tests later revealed she had stopped breathing several times during her life, so co-sleeping may not have been to blame.\nBut Dawn said she still wanted to warn parents about the risks, to prevent another family going through what she had.\nShe said: \"With the guidelines recently changing, I don't think it is clear enough anymore that bedsharing is a risk. Whether you don't take alcohol or don't take drugs, it is still a risk to bedshare.\n\"I know how hard it is to raise babies. I know it's exhausting and I know sometimes all you can do is co-sleep.\n\"But please be aware that there is a risk while doing it. There are ways to make it as safe as possible, but there is still a risk. So I would always advise parents to put their baby asleep on their back, alone in their cot.\"\nSolicitor general, Ruth Charteris KC, said she offered her condolences to anyone who had suffered what was  \"without doubt one of the most devastating tragedies that a family could experience\".\nPreventable deaths\nShe said that overall, safer sleep advice had worked to save the lives of thousands of babies but she was concerned by the findings which showed unsafe co-sleeping was still happening.\n\"I can understand the challenges of getting enough sleep as a family, but expert advice should be followed,\" she said.\n\"The evidence of the cases reported to the procurator fiscal shows that, tragically, babies can and do die in high-risk co-sleeping situations.\"\nShe added: \"It is my sincere hope that by drawing attention to our concerns, prompted by the outcome of our investigations, that the number of baby deaths in which co-sleeping was a preventable factor, can be even further reduced through open conversations about safer sleeping.\"\nLynsey Kidd, executive director at the Scottish Cot Death Trust, said she was concerned by the figures.\nShe said: \"The evidence tells us that for the first six months the safest place for baby to sleep is in a flat, clear, separate space such as a cot, a moses basket or a crib, in the parents' room.\n\"We are concerned as a charity because we support many of these families, and whilst we talk about figures, we see the absolute devastation for families across Scotland who are living with the loss of their baby.\"\nThe Scottish government said it did not yet know the causes of deaths for the babies that COPFS had been notified of.\nA spokesperson added: \"We are very grateful to the many charities that provide vital support and information to families at this very difficult time of their lives. We know that charities will be available to support families who require this as a result of the solicitor general's state",
    "A woman is offering to make Coventry City fans free 2 Tone T-shirts to wear at the club's FA Cup tie, after a player was allegedly racially abused.\nMidfielder Kasey Palmer reported abuse after Coventry's Championship game with Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough last Saturday. A man has been arrested .\nThe clubs meet in the Cup on Friday and fan Sara Phipps said she wanted to show solidarity with Palmer.\n2 Tone music was born in the city with players honouring it in a 2019 kit.\nThe musical genre spread a message of racial unity in the late 70s and early 80s with The Specials, who topped the charts with Too Much Too Young and Ghost Town, very much the face of the scene.\nThe club's kit featured aspects of the music label's black and white branding, and the anti-racism Kick It Out logo.\nMs Phipps said she knew another Sky Blues fan, Ben Wise, had been urging fans to wear their own T-shirts for the game so she posted on X to say she could make some of her own for free.\nShe said she has since been \"inundated\".\n\"I just thought for those going to the game, they want to show a bit of solidarity, because I think every single person in the club was touched by this at the weekend, that I would make something that they could go along, wear and be proud of and just stand with Kasey and say 'we support you'.\n\"I don't want to make money on this, it's not something I want to make a quick buck on, it's just something for the fans. It's something I can do, I can afford to do so why not.\"\nHer T-shirts read \"CCFC Against Racism\" with Palmer's name and number 45 on the back.\nHot cakes\n\"I've been inundated,\" she said.\n\"They've gone like hot cakes.

    "An ancient symbolic code lies behind the intricate patterns of Kashmir's traditional handwoven carpets and rugs.\nCalled talim, the code has been used for hundreds of years to design carpets and convey information to weavers.\nFrom the age of eight, and following in the footsteps of his father, Mohammad Rafiq Sofi has been weaving carpets using talim designs.\n\"It took me five years to learn how to weave properly,\" says Mr Sofi, now 57.\nMuch has changed during his half century in the industry. Mr Sofi says that in the early days it could take more than six months to complete a carpet.\nTo start the process, a designer would draw up a carpet. A talim expert would then encode that design, and in small sections send it off for weaving.\nThose chunks of code would be translated for Mr Sofi and weavers like him, showing them where to knot each thread and which colour to use.\nEach section would only represent a small piece of the carpet, so hundreds would be needed for the whole carpet, with much back and forth between the designers and weavers.\nThe process made mistakes difficult to spot and time-consuming to correct.\nBut these days computer software has streamlined the process and Mr Sofi can finish a carpet in six weeks.\nThe weaving and knotting is still done by hand, but now computer software handles the design and creation of the talim code. It means Mr Sofi can see the whole design at once, instead of just small sections.\nAny potential problems can be spotted in advance, cutting down on time-consuming errors.\n\"This innovation in handmade carpets is not to disrupt the essence of artistic carpets, it's just to speed up the process - designs being available now at a speed,\" says Mehmood Shah, the director of Handloom & Handicrafts for the government of Jammu and Kashmir.\nMore technology of business\nThe latest innovation comes from technology firms that are applying artificial intelligence to the process.\nAby Mathew is chief operating officer at International Virtual Assistance, a computer software firm that specialises in analysing data.\nHis company is training an artificial intelligence (AI) system to understand the talim code by showing it pictures of carpets and lines of talim code.\nThe AI is still being developed and the process will still require a human to write the code, but Mr Mathew says it should speed up manufacturing by decoding the talim instructions for the weavers.\n\"Weavers will be able to try out new patterns, update classic themes to suit contemporary tastes, and produce one-of-a-kind, custom carpets,\" says Mr Mathew.\nAs India grows richer he sees an increasing demand for carpets that the traditional industry will struggle to meet.\n\"The tastes of customers are evolving, with a growing desire for carpets that are fashionable, long-lasting, and low maintenance. Conventional carpet-making techniques are frequently labour-intensive and sluggish - they might not be able to satisfy these needs,\" says Mr Mathew.\nAditya Gupta founded Rug Republic 32 years ago, it now employs around 5,000 people and makes up to 15,000 rugs per month. He says the Indian rug and carpet industry is facing stiff competition from rivals in Turkey and China and needs to keep up with the latest manufacturing techniques.\n\"Innovation is important in every industry - without it, we die,\" he says.\n\"The Indian carpet industry is an interesting case, where it is not only about moving forward with new tech, but rather moving the old and the new hand in hand.\n\"The innovation now is oriented towards creating designs that cannot be copied by machines while still using traditional techniques.\"\nAt Rug Republic, new tech has been introduced for the design, washing and drying of carpets and for monitoring moisture levels. As well as the traditional wool, materials like recycled jeans, cotton and leather have been experimented with.\nDespite all the innovation, Mr Gupta still values the old methods.\n\"The manufacturing side of things still needs to be traditional and handmade as that is the main charm the consumers seek.\"\nThe industry has also been helped by an official tagging system which identifies a genuine hand-knotted Kashmiri carpets.\nBy scanning a QR code buyers can verify the carpet designer and how it was made.\n\"If the [Handicrafts] department hadn't taken this step, maybe this trade in handwoven carpets would have died in a few years,\" says carpet designer, Shahnawaz Ahmad.\nThat would have been a blow as the industry is an important part of the local economy. It employs around 50 thousand workers in Jammu and Kashmir, who collectively produce rugs and carpets worth around \u00c2\u00a336m ($28m) a year.\nThe developments in carpet making have given hope to old-timers like Feroz Ahmad Bhat, who has been weaving carpets for the past thirty years.\n\"In my early days, our earnings were good and a lot of people were involved with this work. Then a time came when wages were very low. But now new designs have been introduced and this work has picked up pac",
    "A fuel emissions levy has taken effect in Ghana, sparking mixed reactions.\nThe government now requires Ghanaians to pay an annual levy for the carbon emissions produced by their petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.\nSeveral citizens are opposing the charge, which they see as an added burden amid an ongoing economic crisis.\nBut some leaders and environmental groups are endorsing it, saying it will cut the country's emissions and help raise more revenue for the government.\nGhana is the third African country to introduce a form of carbon tax, after South Africa and Mauritius.\nThe tax agency, the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), has said that the levy aligns with the government's plans \"to promote the use of eco-friendly technology and green energy\".\nThe GRA began collecting the annual levy, approved by parliament in December, on Thursday. Fees range from 75 Ghanaian cedis ($6; \u00c2\u00a34) for motorised tricycles and motorcycles to 300 cedis ($24) for vehicles with a capacity of 3,000cc or higher.\nBenjamin Boakye, the head of the think-tank Africa Centre for Energy Policy, said the government was \"not being sensitive\" by imposing the levy on top of already-existing fuel and road-use taxes. He also argued that the new policy would not actually lower emissions.\n\"This is not going to prevent anybody from driving. They know you don't have a choice. You will have to pay for it. The carbon will still be generated because the Ghanaian will have to move from one point to the other,\" Mr Boakye was quoted as saying by the Modern Ghana news website.\nThe union of commercial and public transport providers has also criticised the levy and said it was not consulted by the government.\nThe union now plans to hike transport charges by as much as 60% to reflect the added costs of the levy.\nCritics fear that it could have a ripple effect on the struggling economy, further intensifying the cost-of-living crisis that has already pushed up the prices of necessities like fuel.",
    "An abstract photograph by June Sharpe has won this year's International Garden Photographer of the Year competition.\n\"The layered branches of this conifer reminded me of the dancing cranes often featured in Japanese woodcuts,\" said Sharpe.\n\"Now, more than ever, it is vitally important to connect with nature and highlight the beauty and fragility of our planet's ecosystems.\"\nIn post-processing, Sharpe enhanced what she describes as a \"sense of the 'birds' dancing in a fantasy woodland\".\nHead judge Tyrone McGlinchey said: \"When judging pictures we are hoping to be embraced, and taken on a journey, within a story.\n\"We are pulled into and beyond the symbolic dancing cranes, and embraced by their 'wings', to a place of hope and peace.

    "How many children draw helicopters and aeroplanes dreaming of being pilots or designing their own aircraft one day?\nJason Hill was one such teenager, but he clung on to that vision through aeronautical engineering studies and work in the aviation industry.\nHis dream was revealed to the world on 7 December when the wraps came off a new helicopter designed by him.\n\"I felt an overwhelming sense of pride and jubilation,\" Mr Hill says about the grand unveiling. But creating a new helicopter has been a daunting process.\n\"The sheer volume of difficult things that need to be executed and coordinated makes the task seemingly impossible,\" says Mr Hill.\nThe five-seater Hill helicopter will be powered by a turbine engine, a small and light jet motor that drives the rotor blades.

The Hill machine has a price tag of almost \u00c2\u00a3600,000 - cheap for a helicopter, but for most people completely unaffordable.\nNevertheless, there are buyers.

Those buyers have parted with non-refundable deposits of up to \u00c2\u00a3100,000.\nAnd that's all happened before the helicopter's first flight, projected for the middle of this year.\nOf course, it's not just Hill that's able to sell luxury transport options.\nCalifornia's Robinson has popularised helicopter flying with a family of small, two to five seat aircraft that have notched up nearly 14,000 sales for the manufacturer.\nRobinson's R66 Turbine costs just over $1m (\u00c2\u00a3790,000) and it sees orders increasing, growing from 101 helicopters in 2022, to a projected 120 units for 2023, and 150 in 2024.\nThe British Helicopter Association's chief executive Tim Fauchon doesn't dispute that helicopter ownership is for the wealthy. \"If you're flying a helicopter you've got a bit of cash behind you.\"\nHowever it still makes sense to shell out for such a machine when time is of the essence. \"You buy a helicopter to save time, it's an efficient way of getting from A to B.\"\nAnd private helicopter owners can recoup their costs by leasing their machine out to flying schools when they're not using it.\nAlso, appearing on the horizon, are fresh competitors for the helicopter business.\nElectric Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft (Evtol) have been promoted as the answer to a host of regional and urban transport needs with several hundred projects on the go worldwide.\nPowered by batteries and often having multiple rotors, Evtol makers say the aircraft will be cheaper, quieter and easier to maintain than helicopters.\nThe promise is that one day, such aircraft could bring the convenience of helicopter travel to a much bigger market.\nAdam Twidell is working out how to integrate Evtol machines into the operations of private jet club Flexjet, which has ordered an Evtol from Brazil's aerospace giant Embraer.\nIts Eve Evtol machine will, Flexjet hopes, pick up passengers from private terminals and whizz them into city centres.\nMore technology of business\nThe challenge for any new flying machine such as Eve or the HX50 is to win regulatory approval says Mr Twidell. He has no illusions over the extent of testing a new aircraft faces.\n\"In aviation seeing is not believing. Certification means every single part of the machine has to be certified for safety.\"\nCan Hill emulate the success of Robinson or beat off the Evtol challenge? Mr Hill's vision involves dispensing with external suppliers and designing and building all components in-house, including the power plant.\nThe company says 95% of each machine will be constructed in-house, which will result in huge savings, according to Hill.\nHowever industry veterans describe such an approach, as opposed to sourcing parts from established external production lines, as a big challenge.\nHill hopes that it can cut one of the costs of owning a helicopter - the compulsory rebuild that comes after a certain number of hours have been flown.\nFor a Robinson helicopter with a turbine engine this comes at 2,000 hours and costs $400,000. Hill hopes to stretch that figure to 5,000 hours and replace the engine and gear boxes for $150,000.\nSpencer Phillips is head of training at Advance Helicopters, a flying school on England's South Coast.\nAdvance uses a mix of Robinson helicopters, which he praises as \"a great training aircraft\", but is impressed with the specifications of the Hill helicopter.\nHe mentions one feature in particular. The Hill aircraft features a fully automated start-up procedure for the tricky task of monitoring temperatures before fuel can be safely pumped into the turning motor.\nHe explains how this will take a challenging task out of the hands of the private pilot: \"It's far too easy to mess this up with a turbine and melt the engine!\".\nHe accounts for the rush to pay deposits at Hill by the closed nature of the rotary wing world. \"It's word of mouth in the helico",
    "Alan Bates wrote to the government criticising the speed of Post Office scandal compensation payouts - just days before he was made an offer.\nThe former sub-postmaster, whose story sparked an ITV drama, said in a 22 January letter seen by BBC Two's Newsnight that the scheme needed a \"radical boot up the backside\".\nHe said he received a \"cruel\" compensation offer on Wednesday.\nBusiness Secretary Kemi Badenoch has vowed to look into his complaint.\nIn the letter to Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake, Mr Bates said claims from some victims were being processed too slowly.\nMr Bates, whose own offer was received 111 days after his claim was submitted, wrote: \"This is certainly not in the best interests of the victims in the group who continually look for closure of the painful events they have endured which continue to drag on year after year.\"\nHe suggested the firm assessing claims for the government should pay a \u00c2\u00a31,000-a-day penalty to the victim in question if they had not received an offer within 40 days.\nMr Bates added the current compensation scheme \"needs a radical boot up the backside to actually get things moving\".\n'Most offers acceptable'\nMr Hollinrake said Mr Bates \"quite rightly\" raised the issue of speed and reiterated a commitment to issue 90% of initial offers within 40 days of receiving a full claim.\nAn independent panel will decide compensation amounts if victims and the government cannot reach an agreement.\nIn his 29 January reply, also seen by Newsnight, Mr Hollinrake said the \"great majority\" of offers made so far had been acceptable to victims.\nHe added: \"No cases have therefore had to be assessed by the independent panel yet but I am confident in their ability to do so.\"\nOn 31 January, Mr Bates said he had received a compensation offer that was worth about a sixth of what a claim prepared with the help of forensic accountants had asked for.\nHe earlier told the Daily Telegraph : \"Full and fair might be His Majesty's Government's interpretation, but in reality the offer is derisory, offensive and after all this time, yes, cruel.\n\"I will absolutely be turning this offer for financial redress down.\n\"It's just a terrible way to treat human beings - and I have heard from several sub-postmasters who have received similarly derisory offers, while others are still waiting.\"\nMs Badenoch has said that she will look \"personally\" into Mr Bates's complaint and, while not going into the specifics of the case, confirmed she had asked for a meeting.\nThe government confirmed plans for \"full and fair compensation\" to sub-postmasters affected by the IT scandal in 2022.\nMr Bates's two-decade fight inspired the recent ITV series - \"Mr Bates vs the Post Office\" - which told the story of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses who were wrongly prosecuted after faulty computer software calculated money was missing from post office branches.\nThe Post Office brought many of the Horizon IT cases to court itself, and between 1999 and 2015, it prosecuted 700 people - an average of one person a week.\nIn 2017, a group of 555 sub-postmasters took legal action against the Post Office and two years later it agreed to pay them \u00c2\u00a358m in compensation , but much of the money was swallowed up by legal fees.\nMr Bates, who took over a Post Office counter in Llandudno, north Wales in 1998, was among more than 500 people who received an average of about \u00c2\u00a320,000 after the High Court ruling in 2019.\nAlthough campaigners won the right to have their cases reconsidered, only 95 convictions had been overturned.\nThe government has promised to quash their convictions and pay compensation.\nThe government has previously said it would \"swiftly exonerate and compensate\" those affected and settle all claims by 7 August 2024.\nVictims will be able to sign a form to say they are innocent, in order to have their convictions overturned and claim compensation.\nAdditional reporting by Thomas Mackintosh",
    "Killer Valdo Calocane was reported to police for attacking two people weeks before killing three people in Nottingham - but was not arrested.\nLeicestershire Police confirmed the assaults happened less than six weeks before the Nottingham attacks.\nThe two assault victims were work colleagues at a warehouse in Leicestershire.\nThe BBC has asked police why Calocane was not arrested, but the force has not explained.\nCalocane was sentenced to a hospital order on Thursday for killing 19-year-old students Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, and 65-year-old school caretaker Ian Coates.\nThe attorney general is considering whether judges should review the sentence, following anger from the victims' families about the handling of the case.\nCalocane, 32 - who was known to have serious mental health problems - was already a wanted man when he attacked his colleagues, because he had previously assaulted a Nottinghamshire Police officer in September 2021.\nPolice have not publicly given details of the assault, but Mr Webber's mother Emma said it was \"such a violent assault that he was Tasered\".\nHe had been charged in relation to this, but failed to turn up at court, so a warrant was issued for his arrest in September 2022 - a year after the assault.\nIn the meantime, Calocane was in and out of Highbury Hospital due to his mental health problems, and also in the care of a community team.\nDespite the warrant, Nottinghamshire Police did not succeed in arresting Calocane and the force has already said that it \"should have done more\" to detain him.\nThe BBC asked Nottinghamshire Police why they did not arrest Calocane, but the force has not explained.\nWhile the warrant was outstanding, Calocane managed to get a job with Arvato Supply Chain Solutions, at a warehouse the business has near East Midlands Airport.\nHe started there on 1 May 2023 and assaulted two of his colleagues only four days later.\nThe business reported the assaults on the same day they happened, and Leicestershire Police attended, but Calocane was no longer there.\nA Leicestershire Police spokesman said: \"I can confirm officers were called to the warehouse in Wilders Way, Kegworth, shortly before 6pm on 5 May following a report two people had been assaulted.\n\"No serious injuries were reported. It was reported Calocane had been escorted from the site by security staff prior to police arriving.\n\"Our enquiries to establish the full circumstances of the report concerning the incident in Kegworth were ongoing at the time the incident in Nottingham occurred.\"\nThe BBC has asked Leicestershire Police why officers did not find and arrest Calocane afterwards, and asked whether or not officers were aware of the outstanding arrest warrant, but the force would not say.\nRelatives of the three people killed by Calocane have said they feel let down by police.\nReferencing Nottinghamshire Police's failure to arrest Calocane, Emma Webber said: \"If you had just done your jobs properly, there's a very good chance my beautiful boy would be alive today.\"\nSpeaking outside court after Calocane was sentenced on Thursday , she expressed her frustration with Nottinghamshire Police for not being open about the details of the arrest warrant.\n\"It took repeated questioning from us to finally receive an answer late last Friday afternoon to the question of his outstanding warrant, issued September 2022, for a vicious attack on a police officer,\" she said.\nShe also claimed Nottinghamshire Police had misled the victims' families in relation to Calocane supposedly not having a fixed address.\nShe said: \"Why were we repeatedly told through the summer that the offender was a sofa surfer and had no real abode?\n\"Not true. He did. One that was registered in his name in Nottingham, and one that he had been in for six months prior to his eviction on only 11 June last year. Why?\"\nCalocane has paranoid schizophrenia, and the victims' families are angry with NHS mental health services due to what they believe were failings in how he was treated.\nThey are also angry with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for accepting Calocane's manslaughter pleas, rather than prosecuting him for murder, which Mrs Webber said they were \"horrified\" by.\n\"The CPS did not consult with us, as has been reported. Instead, we have been rushed, hastened and railroaded,\" she said.\nMr Coates's son, James Coates, said: \"The failures from the police, the CPS, the health service have resulted in the murder of my father and these two innocent students.\n\"The NHS mental health trusts have to be held accountable for their failures along with the police.\"\nWayne Birkett - who suffered serious injuries including a fractured skull when he was hit by a van being driven by Calocane - has called for a public inquiry into the case.\nHe said felt \"let down by the system that is meant to protect them\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has backed calls for an inquiry.\nSpeaking to ITV's This Morning, he said: \"I am very worried by what appear to be a numbe",

    "This year, straw from Lithuania will envelop a building in the quiet town of Todmorden, West Yorkshire.\nBarbara Jones and her colleagues at Todmorden Learning Centre and Community Hub have hatched a plan to clad the college, built in the 1950s, in more than 1,600 sq metres of straw-stuffed panels - to better insulate it.\n\"We're going to make it a showcase,\" says Ms Jones, an expert on natural building materials.\nThe panels will be supplied by EcoCocon, a Slovakian firm that has appointed Ms Jones as one of its technical sales consultants. Each timber-framed panel is around 400mm thick and contains a mass of chopped straw - essentially, a slightly more high-tech version of the simple straw bales that have been used by some eco-friendly builders for decades.\nSuch solutions have been around for years and other firms are selling similar products, but, with rising demand for insulation and sustainability, EcoCocon is now targeting larger-scale projects. The question is whether straw, a millennia-old building material, can scale up to meet 21st Century ambitions.\nIn panel systems, relatively short pieces of straw are packed together at just the right density, about 110 kg per metre cubed, so that the volume of air inside creates an insulating effect. Ms Jones says this also protects against fire. Loose straw, in contrast, is notoriously flammable.\nAnother handy feature is that the panels can be prepared with the straw protruding slightly. This means they can be pushed against an uneven wall and still form a tight seal - think of the pin art toys you press your hand or face into to make an impression of them.\n\"It will take up the unevenness without you having to put a plaster layer on first - which is a massive cost saving,\" says Ms Jones. She adds that the cost of the panels is not significantly more than many non-natural insulation options, and estimates that it would be possible to build a single house featuring straw insulation panels for about \u00c2\u00a32,000 per square metre.\nKey to EcoCocon's expansion strategy is the launch of a new highly automated factory in Slovakia, due to open by the end of the year. Chief executive Bj\u00c3\u00b8rn Kierulf tells BBC News that it will include robots and a fully digitised process. Straw will be locally sourced in Central and Eastern Europe, stuffed into panels, and then shipped to customers in the UK, for example.\nThere are limitations. Ms Jones says that using the panels for retrofitting smaller properties is unlikely to be a good idea, given their significant width of 400mm. It could make old walls unreasonably thick.\nWhen it comes to new builds, however, rival firm Agile Property and Homes, which offers straw-stuffed panels previously marketed under the brand name ModCell, argues that incoming construction standards are likely to demand higher insulation levels in walls. Therefore, thicker walls might become more common no matter what material you choose. Straw-insulated homes might not, then, seem uniquely chunky in the near future.\nThe UK produces roughly nine million tonnes of straw annually as an agricultural byproduct, says Agile's business development director Finlay White: \"Nine million tonnes is enough to build detached houses - an average three-bedroom detached house - 436,000 of them insulated with straw.\"\nAgile is currently planning to insulate 115 properties this year, a mix of residential, commercial and educational buildings. \"We're looking to more than double, if not treble, capacity,\" says Mr White.\nConsumers may be hesitant about buying a home built with lots of straw in the walls, suggests Richard Fitton, an expert in building physics at the University of Salford. There could be concerns about rodents nesting in the material or problems with the straw becoming damp and mouldy - all issues dismissed by Ms Jones and other proponents, who argue that these are not common or insurmountable problems.\nHowever, insurers might take a different view and jack up premiums for people whose homes are built using less common materials or methods of construction. \"Insurers will want to be confident about how resilient these building materials are and how they might react in a fire, storm, flood, or to extreme temperatures, damp and subsidence,\" says Louise Clark, general insurance policy adviser at the Association of British Insurers.\nProf Fitton says that, from a personal point of view, building with natural materials is desirable, though he adds, \"Do I see the mass house-builders taking it on tomorrow? No, I probably don't.\"\nMore technology of business\nOthers insist straw's potential is as yet unfulfilled. Pete Walker at the University of Bath, who has worked with ModCell in the past, says that straw is an \"untapped resource\" in the construction industry. His own research suggests that straw does not present a significant fire risk and he points out that newer, panel-style systems featuring the material could be attractive to developers looking to reduce their environmental impac",
    "Plans for a third prison in Buckinghamshire housing nearly 1,500 inmates have been approved by the government's Planning Inspectorate.\nBuckinghamshire Council previously rejected the Ministry of Justice's (MoJ) application for a new category C jail at Grendon Underwood, near Aylesbury.\nThe MoJ said the unit would help \"keep dangerous offenders off the streets\".\nThe council said the proposed facility was in the \"wrong location\".\nThe plans had been met with strong opposition from residents and parish councils.\nAn MoJ spokesperson said the decision was \"critical to delivering the 20,000 extra places we need to keep dangerous offenders off the streets and protect the public\".\n\"Our plans will boost the local economy with hundreds of new jobs and we will work closely with the community to ensure they reap the benefits from the new development,\" they added.\n'Wrong location'\nThe outline planning application for the new prison stated the \"resettlement\" jail could house up to 1,468 inmates and would be built on MoJ-owned land next to the existing Grendon (category B secure) and Springhill (category D open) facilities, off Springhill Road - and cover up to 67,000 sq m (721,000 sq ft).\nHundreds of people objected to the plan saying it would cause noise pollution, increased traffic, loss of privacy and sense of security.\nConservative Peter Strachan, the council's cabinet member for planning and regeneration, said: \"This decision is desperately disappointing and is another kick in the teeth for local people already blighted by HS2 and East West Rail construction works in this area.\n\"While we understand the need for more prison places nationally, we remain adamant that this is the wrong location.\"\nHe said the \"rural location\" would not be easy for people to visit inmates.\nA council committee unanimously refused planning permission for the prison back in March 2022, but the MoJ appealed to the Planning Inspectorate.\nGreg Smith, Conservative MP for Buckingham, the constituency which includes the jails, said he was \"deeply, deeply disappointed\" by the decision.\nHe said Buckinghamshire was being \"unfairly\" treated in terms of the effects of the major railway construction projects, which were causing disruption in the county.\n\"I'm disappointed and surprised [at the decision] given the strength of the planning grounds and the strength of local feeling against this,\" he said.\n\"How much more can north Buckinghamshire really take from mega construction projects?\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Negotiations between the UK and Canada on a post-Brexit trade deal have broken down after nearly two years, following a row over beef and cheese.\nCanada has been pushing for the UK to relax a ban on hormone-treated beef, which its producers say in effect shuts them out of the British market.\nThe UK have concerns about 245% import taxes Canada put at the start of the year on British cheese.\nThe pause in talks mean British car firms could also face higher tariffs.\nIt will also mean the UK's trading terms with Canada will now be worse than when it was part of the EU's deal with the country.\nMinette Batters, president of the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales, said she was glad the UK government had not \"given way\" on hormone-treated beef.\nBut the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) described the news as unwelcome.\nDowning Street said the government would \"only negotiate deals that deliver for the British people\", and reserved the right to \"pause negotiations where progress is not being made\".\nBut a spokesperson added: \"We're open to restarting talks with Canada in the future.\"\nNo 10 dismissed a suggestion that Brexit had left the UK worse off in terms of international trade, saying it was a \"benefit of our independent trading status that we are able to insist on the detail of each and every deal to ensure that it works specifically in the UK's interests\".\nTrade between the two countries currently takes place under the terms of a deal the UK rolled over from its time as an EU member.\nA time-limited agreement allowed the UK to continue to sell cars and cheese without high import taxes. But talks about extending these as part of a new deal have now broken down.\nThe arrangements for cheese ended on 31st December 2023 leading to taxes of up to 245% on British imports, while the car deal is due to expire in April.\nThis is the first time the UK has formally suspended talks with a trade partner since formally leaving the EU trading regime in 2021.\nTalks between the two countries on reaching a bespoke agreement had been taking place since March 2022.\n'Relief' for UK farmers\nA spokeswoman for Canada's trade minister Mary Ng said she was \"disappointed\" at the pause in talks, and had communicated this to UK Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch.\n\"Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations,\" the spokeswoman added.\n\"The UK is a long-standing trading partner and I am confident that we can negotiate an agreement that is win-win for Canada and for the UK.\n\"But let me be clear - we will not negotiate an agreement that is not good for Canadians - and not good for our Canadian businesses, farmers and workers\".\nTotal goods trade between the two countries was worth \u00c2\u00a319.2bn in 2020, according to the UK government , with UK imports from Canada worth \u00c2\u00a37.3bn and UK exports to Canada worth \u00c2\u00a311.8bn.\nMs Batters said the UK's decision would be a \"relief for farmers\".\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was pleased the \"government has stuck to its line and not given way\".\n\"We have already damaged our economy and agricultural sector by fully liberalising on trade deals with Australia and New Zealand. We had to take a strong line on this.\"\nHowever, William Bain, trade policy head at the BCC, said: \"For our dairy exporters and parts of our manufacturing industry the loss of key trade preferences puts them in a worse position than before 2020.\n\"Government must help these sectors through difficult times and open up new markets for our goods and services.\"\nMike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said the breakdown in talks sent \"a signal that the UK's world-class automotive products are not welcome in Canada\".\n\"If UK car exports can't use EU parts and components to avoid additional duties it creates a risk that tariffs, potentially charged on top of luxury goods taxes, could be reintroduced,\" he added.\n'Weaker'\nThe Canadian Cattle Association said it backed its government's \"hard-line approach\" on beef rules, adding that the UK had \"shown no indication that it is prepared to fully accept Canada's food safety system which is widely recognized as one of the finest in the world\".\nLabour's shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: \"This is very concerning news and another significant failure from the Conservatives to honour their promises.\n\"Rather than strengthening our trading position post-Brexit these failures have left us in a weaker position, particularly for the automotive sector.\"\nSNP international trade spokesperson Richard Thomson said: \"Westminster's Brexit has damaged the UK's potential for global trade and has dragged Scotland's economy down with it.\"\nFormer Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC the UK was \"absolutely right to suspend negotiations\", and that Canada should \"accept the need to comply with British food stand",
    "A mother used pliers to remove her six-year-old daughter's teeth as she could not get an appointment with an NHS dentist, an MP has said.\nBlackpool South MP Scott Benton told the Commons it was \"sadly impossible\" for new patients to find a health service dentist.\nHe said his constituents were attending surgeries \"pleading with me to get them the treatment they so badly need\".\nThe Department for Health said it had taken steps to improve access.\nThe independent MP told Parliament: \"It is estimated that 40% of my constituents - some 35,000 people - cannot currently access NHS treatment.\n\"Only last week, a mother attended my surgery who had to physically remove the teeth of her six-year-old daughter with pliers because she was in so much pain and could not access the treatment her family needed.\n\"As the NHS dentistry recovery plan is long overdue, would it be in order for the House to receive a ministerial statement on when we may finally see some progress on this issue?\"\nThe leader of the Commons, Penny Mordaunt, replied that she was \"sorry to hear about the situation\" and \"the government have given a considerable uplift to local commissioners to ensure that providers are in place\".\nMr Benton told the BBC the child \"had several rotten teeth\" and \"was in pain and they didn't have a local dentist\".\nThe mother \"wasn't aware of the emergency dental care provided locally at Whitegate Drive and took several of her child's teeth out as a result.,\" he said, adding it was \"an absolutely harrowing and heartbreaking case\".\n\"Our lack of local NHS dentists is unsustainable and unacceptable and the government needs to publish its dental recovery plan urgently and match this with funding to start to repair the situation,\" he said.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said it would be publishing a dental recovery plan shortly and had already taken steps to improve access, including increasing dental training places by 40%.\nIn 2022, a BBC investigation found nine in 10 NHS dental practices across the UK were not accepting new adult patients for treatment under the health service.\nThat investigation was unable to find any practices in Blackpool taking on new NHS patients, with one woman in the resort saying she had resorted to making her own dentures .\nIn December, the Nuffield Trust think tank said the NHS dental service in England had been cut back so much it was now in the most perilous position in its 75-year history .\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Fewer wild birds are visiting UK gardens, with greenfinches, starlings and sparrows seeing the greatest decline, according to the RSPB.\nIt comes as the conservation charity launches its annual Big Garden Birdwatch, the world's biggest wildlife citizen science project.\nThe once plentiful species are being spotted much less frequently than when the survey was launched 45 years ago.\nBut there are winners too. Goldfinches, woodpigeons and parakeets are thriving.\nNew analysis of data from the surveys shows that a well established fall in wild bird sightings is continuing. People who spent an hour watching in their gardens for the survey spotted four fewer during that time on average than two decades ago.\nBack then they spotted an average of 28 birds, while now they see just 24 on average.\nBeccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB told the BBC: \"Sadly this snapshot is a reminder of how many of our most loved birds are at the forefront of the nature and climate emergency.\"\nClimate change is affecting bird populations because it is disrupting the pattern of the seasons. When spring comes early, for example, birds breed sooner than usual and that means baby birds can sometimes face sudden changes in temperature or a shortage of food.\nThe charity's Big Garden Birdwatch (BGBW) survey, has been taking place over the last weekend in January every year since 1979.\nUp to half a million people take part each year, spending an hour watching birds in their gardens, from their balcony or in a local park.\nThe RSPB is urging as many people as possible to get involved with the latest survey, which is happening this weekend. You can find out how here .\nThe survey is a snapshot over a weekend and favours birds that live and feed near human populations, but the broad trends it shows are mirrored by other more systematic surveys.\nA survey published by the British Trust for Ornithology last year found that almost half of all bird species are in decline , for example.\nThe BTO found the number of wild birds in Britain has fallen by 72 million since 1970.\nThe most dramatic declines have been in what were once the UK's most familiar species, including sparrows, starlings and greenfinches.\nMost of that decline happened before 2000, and BGBW results since then suggest there has been a small but welcome uptick in numbers of sparrows and greenfinches after that.\nBut the starling has not been so fortunate. It is still a regular visitor to UK gardens, ranked as number three in the BGBW survey, but the numbers recorded have fallen by over 80% over the last four and half decades.\nTheir decline is thought to be due to the loss of permanent pasture, increased use of farm chemicals and a shortage of food and nesting sites in many areas.\nGreenfinches have been hit hard too, with counts down by over 60% over the same period.\nThe species has been severely impacted by a disease called trichomonosis, carried by a parasite that can live on dirty birdfeeders - that's why they must be cleaned regularly.\nSome other species have been thriving, however.\nGoldfinches did not even make the top 15 in the BGBW rankings in 1979. Now they are up in seventh place. They have benefitted from the increase in birdfeeders in the UK.\nWoodpigeons are also doing very well, up from thirteenth place in the survey to fourth position with sightings up tenfold. The RSPB says the UK now has \"internationally significant\" numbers of woodpigeons.\nAnother winner is the long-tailed tit. It did not feature in the top 15 species when the BGBW began but now regularly appears in the top 10. Climate change has made conditions in the UK more favourable for the bird, according to the RSPB.\nAnne Brenchley of Mold in North Wales has been a keen birdwatcher for the last 60 years. Like most British birdwatchers she's noticed a big reduction in the range of birds in her garden.\n\"We still get lots and lots of common birds\", says Anne, \"but the numbers of some of the more unusual birds have gone down\".\nShe says she now never sees less common species like treecreepers, nuthatches and green woodpeckers in her garden.\nWhat you can do to help wild birds",

    "Rishi Sunak has said fasting once a week is \"an important discipline for me\" as part of a \"balanced lifestyle\".\nThe prime minister does not eat anything for 36 hours at the start of each week, the Sunday Times reported.\nMr Sunak told the BBC's health editor Hugh Pym: \"I tend to try and do some fasting at the beginning of every week as part of a general balanced lifestyle but everyone will do this differently.\"\nHe admitted he also has \"a weakness for sugary things\".\n\"It means that I can then indulge myself in all the sugary treats I like for the rest of the week,\" he added.\nMr Sunak has previously described himself as a \"Coca-Cola addict\", revealing he prefers Mexican Coke because it is made with \"cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup\".\nFriends of the prime minister told the Sunday Times he does not eat from 17:00 on a Sunday until 05:00 on a Tuesday.\nHe is also a fan of exercise and is known to enjoy morning workouts on his Peloton bike.\nIntermittent fasting is where you eat normally at certain times and then restrict or avoid food during other times.\nThere are different versions or patterns.\nA popular one is the 5:2 diet where people eat a normal amount of food for five days straight and then have two days of restricted eating where far fewer calories are consumed.\nAnother system, called the 16/8 method, involves restricting your eating to an eight-hour period before fasting for the 16 hours in between.\nFasting allows the body to use stored body fat for energy, which can lead to weight loss.\nClare Thornton-Wood, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, said intermittent fasting could help people lose weight but \"it needs to go hand-in-hand with eating a healthy, balanced diet for the rest of the time\".\n\"If you then make up those calories by eating more on other days and eat whatever you like for the rest of the week, you actually won't lose weight overall,\" she added.\nMs Thornton-Wood said people should always get medical advice before trying intermittent fasting as it is not advisable for groups including children, teenagers, anyone with a history of eating disorders, with diabetes or who is breastfeeding or pregnant.",
    "Police clashed with protesters in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, on Wednesday as lawmakers discussed a controversial bill proposed by newly-elected president Javier Milei.\nThe \"omnibus bill\" contains hundreds of articles which - if passed - will usher in sweeping free-market reforms.\nMr Milei was elected in November on a promise to overhaul Argentina's crisis-hit economy and lower inflation.\nBut some of his proposals have met with strong opposition from some lawmakers.\nMr Milei has warned that unless radical reforms are implemented, Argentina would face \"a social catastrophe of biblical proportions\".\nRead more about Argentina's economic crisis: 'We're the country of beef, but we can only afford chicken'\nThe annual inflation rate is at 211% - the highest in more than three decades. Over 40% of people live in poverty, according to the country's statistics office.\nThe bill as originally proposed by the president contained more than 650 articles. But in an attempt to gain the support of the opposition, which has a majority in the lower house, it has since has been whittled down considerably.\nThe proposals which were dropped include an overhaul of the tax system and a proposal to change the way pensions are calculated.\nAnd while the bill still proposes the privatisation of a number of state-run companies, oil giant YPF is no longer among them.\nBut a provision which would grant President Milei special emergency powers - allowing him to take decisions without consulting Congress on a number of matters, including economics and security - is still part of the proposed legislation, although the length has been halved from two years to one.\nCritics of the bill say it would undermine Argentina's democracy. But President Milei argues that the country needs \"shock therapy\" if it is to recover from the economic crisis it has been mired in for years.\nWhen he sent the bill to Congress, Mr Milei said he and his government needed \"the right tools\" to combat the issues \"at the root of the country's impoverishment\".\nAnd while many Argentines back his radical plans, some of his reforms have already stalled.\nOn Tuesday, a court ruled that the labour reforms Mr Milei had pushed through by decree were unconstitutional. The reforms had already been suspended following an earlier court ruling just weeks after the president had brought them in by decree.\nThe judges said that President Milei had overstepped his powers when he brought in the reforms without the approval of Congress.\nThe government can appeal against the decision but for now it appears focussed on getting approval for its omnibus bill.\nThe discussion in the lower house is due to continue on Thursday and is expected to take many more hours.\nIf approved, it will then face scrutiny and another vote in the Senate.",

    "Plans for 36 more Senedd politicians cleared their first hurdle on Tuesday night.\nSenedd members voted to back in principle new legislation to expand the Welsh Parliament at the next election in 2026.\nIt proposes a new voting system which has been criticised for potentially leaving voters with less choice.\nBut the government minister leading the changes said the new elections will \"ensure every vote counts\".\nDuring a passionate debate, a senior Welsh Conservative said the system amounts to a \"power grab\" for political parties.\nA total of 39 politicians supported the first stage of the legislation's passage through the Senedd, with 14 against.\nIt is not the last vote, with further amendments and discussion to come.\nBy the end two-thirds of the Welsh Parliament must back the legislation for it to become law - but that is likely with both Labour and Plaid supporting the plans.\nUnder the 'closed lists' system at elections voters will pick parties, instead of individual candidates.\nThe aim is that candidates will be elected according to the proportion of their vote.\nBut the inability of voters to pick an individual candidate has been criticised by a Senedd committee, a Welsh political expert and a Labour MS .\n'More representative'\nLabour's Counsel General Mick Antoniw admitted the so-called closed list electoral system was a \"compromise\".\nHe said: \"It will improve democracy and ensure that every vote counts. It will lead to a Senedd that's far more representative of the people of Wales in all our diversities.\n\"It simplifies the current system - voters will have one ballot paper instead of two. And it is a system that is already familiar to voters being used for the current regional list ballots.\"\nHe added that MSs would have an opportunity to look at the issue again after the next election in a formal review.\n\"We've waited 20 years for this package of reforms and I believe that, taken together, they help to create a parliament for Wales that will be fit for purpose for the next 20 years and beyond.\"\n'Wales needs more doctors, not more politicians'\nBut Conservative MS Darren Millar said the Senedd should be \"discussing matters which are more important to the people of Wales\".\n\"Wales needs more doctors, nurses, dentists and teachers. It does not need more politicians.\"\nHe said the closed list system will be \"devastating for Welsh democracy\".\n\"This is a system which amounts to a power grab by political parties taking power away from the voters and preventing them from being able to vote for a candidate of their choice.\"\nMr Millar called for a referendum: \"give the people of Wales the choice on whether to endorse this atrocious system to elect people to this Senedd or not.\n\"I can tell you which fingers they will use to salute you in response,\" he said.\nFormer Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, who helped draw up the original plans with Mark Drakeford, argued against the Conservative's case.\n\"Strengthening our democracy's ability to deliver, to strengthen its ability to deliver its key function, which is to improve the lives of the people - that's not a distraction from the work of politics, that's at the heart of politics.\n\"If you follow the logic of your argument, then actually you're arguing in favour of abolition, which is I hope not where you really want to go.\"\nMr Millar replied that his party was not in favour of abolition.\nPlaid Cymru's Heledd Fychan said: \"These are ambitious plans and let us not allow anyone to claim otherwise, because Wales will be the first national legislature in the UK to move away from the first-past-the-post electoral system.\"\nLabour backbencher Mike Hedges used his speech to criticise the legislation.\nHe said he would vote for the general principle, but said he shared the \"significant reservations\" of a Senedd committee of the closed list system, and warned it could leave Wales with very large constituencies.\n\"Can we approve everything but the electoral system,\" he asked.\nThe Welsh Conservatives' Natasha Asghar said: \"What I really would like to know is how on earth the Welsh government can really justify spending upwards of \u00c2\u00a3120m on putting more politicians in this place when the public services are truly struggling and the government is slashing vital budgets.\n\"Quite simply, the bill is a waste of time, money and effort in my opinion.\"\n'Good comrades'\nJane Dodds, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader and the party's only MS, was also critical of the closed list system proposed.\nShe said: \"In its current form this bill falls far far short of building a healthier, more equitable and inclusive democracy.\"\n\"If Welsh labour wanted a different system to the one that's been proposed, Plaid Cymru would have supported it.

    "The introduction of \u00c2\u00a32 bus fares has seen passenger numbers in North Yorkshire increase by 11% in the last year.\nA council report said the growth had helped passenger numbers on commercial services recover to 90% of pre-Covid levels.\nHowever, North Yorkshire Council was told it had also led to some services becoming overcrowded at times.\nThe authority also heard bus firms were still facing pressure over fuel costs.\nThe \u00c2\u00a32 cap on a single bus ticket was introduced by the government as a cost-of-living measure and to help bus firms bring passenger numbers back to pre-pandemic levels.\nIntroduced as a temporary measure in 2023, it has been extended several times and is due to expire at the end of December.\nA report to a meeting of the council's transport scrutiny committee said feedback from bus companies about the cap had been \"mainly positive, in that the scheme is generating more passenger journeys, although the level of funding provided is not always enough to provide extra capacity\".\n'Overloading issues'\nThe report also said the fare cap had been \"a significant factor\" in Yorkshire Coastliner's decision not to withdraw the Route 840 Leeds to Whitby service.\nThe firm had suggested the route, once voted the most scenic in the UK, might end, prompting a petition urging the Malton to Whitby leg to be saved.\nHowever, in October 2023, Transdev announced \"unprecedented\" demand for the Coastliner service as people headed to Whitby for its annual goth weekend.\n\"The fare cap has been a significant factor in Yorkshire Coastliner's decision not to withdraw the Route 840 Leeds to Whitby service.\n\"However, it has led to some overloading issues, particularly on tourist routes and at busy times of the year.\"\nThe meeting also heard about the results of its transport survey which attracted responses from 5,000 people.\nIt found low levels of satisfaction with North Yorkshire's transport system, with concerns raised about availability, reliability and affordability.\nThe findings will help shape the council's transport plan, which has to be in place by December.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Gene therapy has transformed the lives of people with a genetic disorder that causes painful and unpredictable swelling attacks.\nAngiodema, thought to affect 50,000 people worldwide, can be seriously debilitating, affect airways, and occasionally prove fatal.\nPatients treated with a single dose of gene therapy Crispr-Cas9 showed little sign of further symptoms.\nThe therapy also has big potential as a treatment for other genetic conditions.\n\"It looks as if the single-dose treatment will provide a permanent cure for my hereditary angioedema patients' very disabling symptoms,\" principal investigator Dr Hilary Longhurst, a clinical immunologist at Auckland hospital, said.\nAngiodema causes swelling in the soft tissues and can affect many parts of the body.\nCleveland Firman, from Suffolk, who received the treatment in the UK said: \"The randomness, unpredictability and potential severity of the attacks has made trying to live my life almost impossible. I spent my life constantly wondering if my next attack would be severe.\n\"The swellings are painful and disfiguring. I was embarrassed to go out in case of an attack. I've been hospitalised with swellings on my neck and throat that have affected my ability to breathe.\n\"Since the treatment, I've not had a single attack. I've had a radical improvement in my physical and mental wellbeing.\n\"I am very positive about the future. I am now volunteering where I can meet like-minded people. The freedom has opened up my world and improved my self-confidence.\"\nSingle infusion\nCrispr-Cas9 is a DNA cutting and pasting system that scientists have borrowed from nature. Bacteria use it to protect themselves against foreign DNA from viruses. Scientists have been using it in the lab to target and cut out faulty DNA in human cells that cause illnesses.\nHowever, the edits are not always perfect and the cuts can end up in the wrong place.\nIn the trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, angiodema symptoms were reduced by 95% among a small group of patients from the UK, New Zealand, and the Netherlands given a single infusion - targeted at cells in the liver - to reduce the KLKB1 gene's ability to produce plasma prekallikrein.\nJust one of the patients continued to show symptoms, which were only minor.\nDr Padmalal Gurugama, who led the UK branch of the research, at Cambridge University Hospital, said the therapy could significantly improve lives.\n\"Hereditary angioedema can cause patients severe swellings and intense pain, which can be life-threatening as well as restricting normal activities, such as going to work or school,\" he said.\n\"Because it is often misdiagnosed, many patients undergo unnecessary treatments and invasive procedures.\n\"This is not the only condition in which Crispr-based gene editing is being tried.\n\"There are a lot of clinical trials targeting various other conditions that are producing similar results.\"\nThe patients will be followed up for 15 years - to monitor the treatment's long-term safety and efficacy.\nLarger trials are also scheduled.",

    "A railway station's new buildings opened their doors to passengers for the first time on Sunday.\nThe additions at University station in Birmingham include wider entrances, stairways and exits, Transport for West Midlands (TfWM) said.\nUniversity has up to 3.5m passengers a year, making it of the busiest stations in the region.\nThe station's original building opened in 1978 to accommodate just 500,000 journeys per year.\nIt serves the neighbouring University of Birmingham and Queen Elizabeth Hospital.\nTfWM said the new buildings offered lifts to the platforms, more open space, and better customer facilities.\nThe main pavilion building also includes space for a caf\u00c3\u00a9 or convenience shop, due to be announced soon, and an NHS facility on the first floor.\nThe original building from 1978 has been retained as an exit-only space for passengers.\nFootfall at the station has increased over the last decade as a result of the expansion of both the university and the redevelopment of the hospital and, anticipating further growth in customer numbers, the site's overhaul has been designed to accommodate up to 7.2m passengers per year.\nSunday's opening followed a complex three-year construction programme during which the station remained open and operational.\nThis included installing new bridges over both the live railway line and the Birmingham to Worcester canal.\nAndy Street, mayor of the West Midlands, said: \"It's good news that we now have a superb gateway for thousands of people arriving at University every day - no longer having to queue on stairs and funnel through what was a fairly tiny building on their way to lectures or hospital appointments.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "After years in development, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is finally out - but where are the reviews?\nThe latest game from developer Rocksteady, creators of the acclaimed Batman: Arkham series, has had a rocky start.\nPlayers take on the role of the Suicide Squad - Harley Quinn, Deadshot, King Shark and Captain Boomerang - four dangerous villains in the DC Comics universe.\nTheir targets are Justice League superheroes including Superman, the Flash, and Batman himself.\nAfter early previews of the game were less-than-positive, major gaming site IGN, which published one of them, said it had been refused a review copy.\nIt wasn't alone - most journalists only received codes on Tuesday, when the online game's servers were switched on.\nUsually, websites and streamers receive advance copies much earlier to give them enough time to write a comprehensive review.\nThis doesn't always happen, and IGN itself pointed out that publisher Warner Bros Games was under no obligation to send it a free copy.\nBut Victoria Phillips Kennedy, who works for UK-based gaming site Eurogamer, says: \"I do feel it's a slightly unusual response.\"\nShe tells BBC Newsbeat she believes \"lukewarm\" previews \"possibly influenced their decision to hold off on review code\".\nBut Victoria points out that the previews - even IGN's \"We Played it and Didn't Like It\" - weren't terrible. They just weren't great.\n\"There were a lot of people saying that there was an OK game there but it wasn't going to shake the industry,\" she says.\n\"This is not the reaction Rocksteady wanted.\"\nBBC Newsbeat's asked WB Games to comment on claims it withheld review codes in response to negative previews.\nKill the Justice League is a tough follow-up for the UK-based studio - its Arkham trilogy of Batman games were innovative, influential and are regarded by some as the greatest superhero titles ever.\nAnd fans of those single-player adventures weren't too impressed when Kill the Justice League - a multiplayer-focused squad shooter - was first revealed in 2020.\nThe biggest concern for many was the studio's shift from one-player games to a \"live service\" multiplayer model where a stream of new content - usually with an extra charge - is regularly added to the game.\nThis is supposed to make it feel fresh and keep people playing for as long as possible. But the genre's fallen out of favour recently and is often criticised as a cash-spinner for companies.\nThat hasn't put everyone off Kill the Justice League and plenty of people paid \u00c2\u00a3100 - \u00c2\u00a340 above RRP - for early access to the game when its servers came online at midnight on Tuesday.\nAt least, that was the plan.\nVictoria says players in New Zealand and Australia logged on first and were hit with a bug that instantly completed the game.\nSoon after, spoilers appeared online and Rocksteady was forced to take the game offline temporarily to repair the issue, giving affected players $20 (\u00c2\u00a316) in-game credit.\nThat fuelled more online backlash and bad press, with critics branding the game a flop before it was even out. But there are plenty of Rocksteady fans defending the game, especially on the game's official Reddit page and Discord channel.\nTom, from South Yorkshire, tells Newsbeat he's \"never really cared towards what the internet says.\"\n\"Some of those Batman games were some of my favourite games I've ever played,\" he says.\n\"I've been looking forward to a new release from Rocksteady ever since Arkham Knight.\"\nTom bought the early access version of the game and says he's had no problems with servers and has been having a good time so far.\nSo do reviews even matter?\nOne person who thinks they do is Milo, better known as MrRoflWaffles on YouTube.\nHe regularly broadcasts gaming content to almost two million subscribers and has done paid work for publisher Warner Bros Games - Suicide Squad included.\nBut he tells Newsbeat that, if it is true that review codes were held back due to negative previews, it's a \"harmful approach\".\n\"It creates this narrative among the fans saying - \"Oh, that outlet's not getting a code because they trash-talked a game,\" he says.\n\"But it's a twisted interpretation of what's happening.\"\nHe says \"the consumer loses out when the press is outside the room\".\n\"You need those people who are being critical as part of the conversation to make a better environment for consumers,\" he says.\nIn Milo's view, when reviews go out late \"fans are left guessing as to whether the game is worth buying on launch\".\n\"I think that's the last thing you want when you're trying to make an informed decision on a fairly expensive video game.\"\nAs for Suicide Squad, Milo says he bought a copy for himself and has found it to be a \"mixed bag\".\n\"There are some elements which I really enjoy,\" he says.\n\"There are also some kinda wobbly parts of it, I'd say. But overall I'm having a good time with it.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",
    "Tata Steel has told workers it has lost \u00c2\u00a3160m in the past three months - around \u00c2\u00a31.7m a day.\nIn a message to staff the company said it is \"open to further investment\" in Port Talbot, but it did not expect any government to cover its losses.\nSome politicians have questioned its claimed losses, but Tata Steel said its audited accounts were a \"true and fair view\" of its finances.\nUnions and Tata Steel will consult over restructuring plans to cut 2,800 jobs.\nSteel company executives will face scrutiny from MPs on Wednesday when they appear before the Welsh Affairs Select Committee.\nIn a \"fact checker\" memo to its workforce the company said it wanted to respond to \"incomplete\" and \"misleading\" speculation about its UK operations.\nThe company has announced it will close both blast furnaces in Port Talbot, the UK's largest steelworks, by the end of 2024.\nIt will then build a greener electric arc furnace in future which melts scrap steel.\nUnions and the Welsh government have called for a transition period between the end of blast furnace production and the launch of a greener steelmaking facility.\n\"It's not an option to continue with the status quo,\" the company said. \"If we don't act to dramatically reduce our CO\u00e2\u0082\u0082 emissions, we will be out of business.\"\nStephen Kinnock, Labour MP for Aberavon had questioned Tata Steel's claim that it was losing over \u00c2\u00a31m a day.\n\"I think somebody needs to look at that figure, because I have always been very sceptical about that figure,\" he told the BBC on 18 January.\nTata Steel UK \"pays carbon costs of \u00c2\u00a370-\u00c2\u00a380m a year for operating its blast furnaces\" and said it had lost over \u00c2\u00a34bn since buying the UK steel business from Corus in 2007.\nThe company has committed to investing \u00c2\u00a3750m in a new electric arc furnace in Port Talbot, which the UK government will also support with a \u00c2\u00a3500m subsidy.\nIn a BBC Wales interview when its plans were announced the chief executive of Tata Steel, TV Narendran, said he would welcome future government subsidies to add greater steelmaking capacity to Port Talbot.\nThe message was repeated in the document sent to staff, with the company stating that \"with the right investment and policy environment, it is open to further investment, such as in a direct reduced iron (DRI) plant.\"\nDRI is a cleaner method of producing iron using natural gas. The iron is then fed into an electric arc furnace to produce steel.\nTata added it would consider building a DRI plant \"if the business conditions are right and, if in future, the government supported further investment\".\nBut it warned that staffing levels on a DRI plant, as with an electric furnace, are far lower than the numbers required to operate a blast furnace.",

    "Young fans of Olivia Rodrigo, Eminem and other music stars have been shown explicit lyrics on Spotify even when users have blocked explicit content.\nThe streaming service often shows a song's original lyrics, which can include racial slurs and swear words, on screen when the clean 'radio friendly' version is played.\nThe BBC found the issue occurring with dozens of big songs by artists like Dua Lipa, The Weeknd, Drake and Lil Nas X.\nSpotify declined to comment.\nThe BBC understands the company is aware of the problem and working to fix it.\nSpotify introduced a system designed to deal with explicit content in 2018 after parents put pressure on the company , and explicit songs are marked with an 'E'.\nAnyone who wants to avoid hearing swearing can choose to block explicit content in their settings, and clean versions will often be offered instead.\nHowever, the lyrics in Spotify's database for many of these edited versions can be the same as the originals, meaning anyone looking at the lyrics will see the explicit words.\nCurrently more than a third of the songs in Spotify's UK top 50 chart contain explicit lyrics. Of those, half show the explicit lyrics on screen when the clean edit is played.\nThe BBC found 100 more high-profile affected tracks, including some that feature in children's film soundtracks or on child-friendly playlists. They include:\nSpotify appeared to remove lyrics for a small number of songs on Wednesday after being alerted to the problem by the BBC.\nThe BBC has also discovered that on desktops or laptops, people can still read the lyrics of explicit versions of songs even when the tracks are blocked, simply by clicking on the track names from a search or artist profile page.\nSpotify is the world's most popular music streaming service with more than 500 million users.\n'You're reading every word'\nJames Roach, who produces music under the name Midlo and has written for parenting website Music Football Fatherhood, is the dad of two children, one of whom is just discovering music in his own right.\n\"It's something you don't really think about until you have a child who's of an age where they can actually start to comprehend and make sense of words and language,\" he says.\n\"My son is seven going on eight. It's only recently that this has become a thing, where it could actually become a problem, because up to now he wouldn't read stuff or pay attention, but now he's finding music that he likes, and he can read well.\n\"Kids do want to imitate these artists and sing the songs, but it's not always 100% clear what is being said sometimes.\n\"So you do go online, or you go to these platforms to see what the actual words are. And I think that makes it even worse because you're looking for it. You're reading every word.\"\nAs a producer, Roach says people who upload songs have the option to submit different lyrics for different versions of songs, but suspects some people are \"lazy\" and use the same lyrics for both the explicit and clean edits.\n\"You would like to think that at Spotify headquarters they've got a process in place,\" he says. \"It's a surprise that they're outsourcing.\"\nSpotify and some other music streamers source lyrics from a firm called Musixmatch, which describes itself as \"the world's largest collection of song lyrics used by millions of people to get instant time synced lyrics\".\nMusixmatch allows fans to add, correct or translate lyrics in exchange for \"kudos\".

    "A \"fantasist\" who made false rape allegations against six innocent men is facing prison.\nLiam Smith, also known as James Robertson or James Smith, made a total of seven untrue reports to the police against six different victims, Newcastle Crown Court heard.\nHe was found guilty of seven counts of intending to pervert the course of justice and will be sentenced in March.\nJudge Penny Moreland warned him a jail term would \"inevitable\".\nProsecutors said Smith, 27, of Armley Ridge Road, Leeds, was a \"troubled young man\" who had a problem separating \"fact from fiction\" and may have made the damaging claims out of a \"desire for attention\".\nAs a result, six men, who had consensual encounters with Smith in Newcastle, Wearside and South Tyneside, faced the trauma of being wrongly accused and questioned or even arrested, prosecutor Anne Richardson said.\nShe said Smith started a chain of police investigations which were \"not only unnecessary and time consuming but which caused appalling suffering and anxiety for those innocent men who were accused by him.\"\n'Desire for attention'\nMs Richardson said Smith was \"perhaps a fantasist\" or had a \"latent desire for attention\", and made the claims between 2018 and 2021.\nOne man, who Smith made two false claims about, spent 14 hours at a police station and had to provide intimate samples for analysis, the court heard.\nAnother man spent 10 hours in custody and a third eight hours, Ms Richardson said.\nSmith was remanded into custody ahead of sentencing on 22 March.\nJudge Moreland told him: \"You know that the inevitable sentence is one of immediate custody.\"\nFollow BBC North East  on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram .

    "Disposable vapes are set to be banned as part of plans to tackle the rising number of young people taking up vaping, the government says.\nMeasures will also be introduced to prevent vapes being marketed at children and to target under-age sales.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak suggested adult smokers trying to quit would still have access to alternatives like vapes under the proposals.\nThe ban is expected to be introduced across the UK, the government said.\nIt is already illegal to sell any vape to anyone under 18, but disposable vapes - often sold in smaller, more colourful packaging than refillable ones - are a \"key driver behind the alarming rise in youth vaping\", according to the government.\nFigures from the Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) charity suggest 7.6% of 11 to 17-year-olds now vape regularly or occasionally, up from 4.1% in 2020.\nAnnouncing the plans on Monday, Mr Sunak said it was right that \"strong action\" was taken to stamp out vaping in children.\n\"Children shouldn't be vaping, we don't want them to get addicted, we still don't understand the full long-term health impacts,\" he said.\nThe UK Vaping Industry Association said vapes had helped \"millions of adults quit and stay off cigarettes\", and said the proposals would put children at risk by \"turbocharging the black market\".\nMr Sunak suggested the proposals struck the right balance between restricting access for children and maintaining access for adult smokers trying to quit smoking.\nVaping is substantially less harmful than smoking, but it has not been around for long enough for its long-term risks to be known, according to the NHS.\nMore on vaping and disposable vapes\nThe vapour that is inhaled can still contain small amounts of chemicals that are found in cigarettes, including nicotine - which is addictive but not seen by the health service as one of the most problematic ingredients in cigarettes.\nThe proposals follow last year's announcement of a ban on the sale of cigarettes to anyone born on or after 1 January 2009 as part of an attempt to create a \"smoke-free generation\".\nFormer prime minister Liz Truss criticised the proposed ban, describing it as \"profoundly unconservative\".\nHealth Secretary Victoria Atkins told the BBC she was confident the new bill regarding vapes would pass Parliament by the time of the general election - expected to be this year - with it coming into force in early 2025.\nOnce the timing is confirmed, retailers will be given six months to implement it.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he supported a disposable vapes ban but criticised what he described as a two-year delay by the government in introducing legislation. The bill could be brought in using existing legislation designed to protect the environment.\nCampaigners have long argued that disposable vapes are wasteful and that the materials and chemicals used to make them, including their lithium batteries, make them difficult to dispose of safely.\nThe latest changes would also introduce powers to stop refillable vapes being sold in a flavour marketed at children and to require that they be produced in plainer, less appealing packaging.\nThe government will also be able to mandate that shops display refillable vapes out of sight of children and away from other products they might buy, like sweets.\nA further public consultation will take place to decide which flavours should be banned and how refillable vapes will be sold, the government said.\nTo help stop under-age sales, additional fines will be brought in for any shops in England and Wales caught selling vapes illegally to children.\nGlyn Potts, head teacher of Oldham's Newham Catholic College, said action needed to be taken to stop children being \"bombarded\" with \"attractive\" products on social media and in shops.\nHe also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was evidence that some vape pens had been repurposed to contain \"cannabis derivatives\" which he claimed could hospitalise young people.\nVaping alternatives like nicotine pouches - small white pouches that are placed between the lip and gum - will also be banned for children. The pouches release nicotine but do not contain tobacco, so can currently be legally sold to under-18s.\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments both said they would introduce bans, either with legislation in their own parliaments or by supporting UK-wide measures.\nNorthern Ireland remains without a devolved administration following a breakdown of power sharing, but its Department of Health said it had \"a long-standing strategic aim\" to be tobacco-free and would make preparations to allow incoming ministers to take a decision on the ban.\nThe UK has joined a small group of countries planning to ban disposable vapes. Australia, France, Germany and New Zealand have all announced similar plans, although only New Zealand has so far implemented them.\nSome will argue the UK's plans still don't go far enough. There have been calls for a tax on e-cigarettes to bring them in line with tobacco, wh",
    "A project which aims to improve 'racial literacy' in secondary schools will be officially launched this month.\nLit Legacies brings together educational resources for a play set amidst the Bristol Bus Boycott .\nFour black British teachers will collaborate on the six-week project to tackle the \"teaching barriers\" in black British literature.\nUniversity of the West of England (UWE) lecturer Amy Saleh hopes the project will influence the future of teaching.\nSteered by Ms Saleh, the official launch of the Lit Legacies scheme takes place on 31 January, at Fairfield High School in Horfield.\nIt centres around the play Princess & The Hustler, by Chinonyerem Odimba, a celebration of British-Caribbean girlhood, family and culture, set in St Paul's in 1963.\n'Absence of black writers'\nThe scheme follows existing curriculum guides for studying the play, but provides additional teacher training on how best to facilitate 'race talk' in the classroom.\nMs Saleh, a senior lecturer in Education at UWE, said: \"In 2020, the absence of black writers from GCSE English Literature set text lists was widely acknowledged in educational reports and news outlets.\n\"Since then, UK exam boards have added a range of black British texts. That includes Princess & The Hustler.\"\nBut despite black writers appearing on set text lists, Ms Saleh said that previous research has found that most students are likely to study texts written by white authors.\n\"Issues of time, money, subject knowledge, and teacher confidence, are barriers, in addition to most secondary school teachers having had no training on how to talk about race,\" she said.\n\"I thought 'what can be done to remove some of those barriers' and so, the project was conceived.\"\nPilot workshops were run in two local secondary schools for GCSE students to get to know the play, look at sample resources, and offer their evaluations of the scheme.\nIn one of the workshops, when asked why a text like Princess & The Hustler should be studied in schools, a student said: \"Because it's relatable, and it's useful for people of colour to have an example of what their home life can look like.\"\nMs Saleh added: \"Through class observations and focus groups, the student voice and experience can be centred, potentially influencing the teaching and learning of black British literature in the future.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "The boss of Jaguar Land Rover has denied that his company's vehicles are especially vulnerable to theft.\nAdrian Mardell said the Range Rover \"is not 'Britain's most stolen vehicle'\" after a series of reports about soaring insurance costs for UK owners.\nHe accused the insurance industry of failing to take into account all data when setting cover and premiums.\nLast year, JLR launched its own insurance after some drivers were unable to get cover at all.\nSpeaking angrily to journalists after JLR announced its latest financial results, Mr Mardell said that vehicle theft by organised criminals was a serious issue in the UK, but his own business had been unfairly singled out.\n\"It is not 'Britain's most stolen vehicle', as reported incorrectly\", said Mr Mardell, adding that he wanted to correct what he described as \"misinformation\" and a \"myth\" about thefts, in particular where Range Rovers were concerned.\nIt follows reporting, including by Bloomberg , which said the Range Rover Velar model \"was the most-stolen car in the year to March 2023, with more than two out of every 100 reported stolen\" citing data from the UK's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.\nA wave of car thefts in recent years has concerned some carmakers that it may have a knock-on effect on demand for vehicles, particularly luxury models.\nRange Rovers, often used by celebrities, politicians and even royalty, have received much of the attention.\nThe cars can cost anything between \u00c2\u00a340,080 to almost \u00c2\u00a3200,000 for more advanced models.\nMr Mardell said thefts of Range Rovers had fallen 27% last year compared with 2022 and new models were especially secure.\nOf the latest Range Rover model, he said only 11 vehicles out of a total of 12,800 sold had been stolen, according to police data.\n\"There is no reason whatsoever why any insurance company should not gladly and readily insure those new vehicles.

    "A New York jury has decided Donald Trump should pay $83.3m (\u00c2\u00a365m) for defaming columnist E Jean Carroll in 2019 while he was US president.\nThe penalty in the civil trial is made up of $18.3m for compensatory damages and $65m in punitive damages.\nMr Trump was found in a previous civil case to have defamed Ms Carroll and sexually assaulted her in the 1990s.\nHe vowed to appeal the latest ruling, calling the case a witch hunt and the verdict \"absolutely ridiculous\".\nIn the latest trial, the jury was only required to decide how much compensation, if any, should be awarded to Ms Carroll.\nThe compensatory damages are meant to account for the harm that the jury found his comments had done to her reputation and emotional wellbeing.\nThe panel also had to come up with a punitive penalty intended to stop Mr Trump from continuing to speak out against her.\nIt took the jury of seven men and two women less than three hours to reach a verdict on Friday afternoon.\nMr Trump, who looks likely to be the Republican candidate in November's presidential election, also faces four criminal cases for a total of 91 felony counts .\nHe is the first president in US history to be charged with a crime, but has pleaded not guilty or denied all the charges.\n\"This is a great victory for every woman who stands up when she's been knocked down, and a huge defeat for every bully who has tried to keep a woman down,\" Ms Carroll said in a statement after the jury's decision on Friday.\nHer attorney, Robbie Kaplan, said in a statement: \"Today's verdict proves that the law applies to everyone in our country, even the rich, even the famous, even former presidents.\"\nMr Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, or even that he has ever met Ms Carroll, including on Friday morning.\nBut following the verdict he refrained from attacking her directly when he slammed the outcome of the case in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\"I fully disagree with both verdicts,\" he wrote, \"and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party.\n\"Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment Rights. THIS IS NOT AMERICA!\"\nA civil trial last year found Mr Trump sexually assaulted Ms Carroll, a magazine columnist, in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in the 1990s.\nThat jury also found him liable for defamation for calling her accusations a lie - and he was ordered to pay her about $5m in damages.\nThe case that ended on Friday focused on different defamatory comments by Mr Trump in 2019.\nMs Carroll has yet to receive any money from Mr Trump.\nThe former president has paid a deposit to the court while the appeal process on the first defamation suit plays out, former federal prosecutor Mitch Epner said.\nThe same rules will apply to these much higher damages, Mr Epner added, where Mr Trump will have to put up an extra $83.3m - in either cash or an appeal bond - as a deposit.\nMr Trump, who abruptly left court earlier in the day with his Secret Service security detail, was not present to hear the verdict.\nHis departure came moments after Judge Kaplan threatened to jail Mr Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, for continuing to speak after he had told her to be quiet.\n\"You are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup. Now sit down,\" he told Ms Habba.\nThe judge had threatened to eject Mr Trump earlier after he muttered about the case being a \"con job\" and a \"witch hunt\" in court. Before the verdict was read, the judge warned: \"We will have\u00c2\u00a0no\u00c2\u00a0outbursts.\"\nDuring closing arguments earlier on Friday, a lawyer for Ms Carroll told the court her reputation had been severely harmed by the former president's comments denying he sexually assaulted her.\n\"This case is also about punishing Donald Trump... This trial is about getting him to stop once and for all,\" she said.\nMs Carroll's attorneys previously told the court that Mr Trump's statements unleashed a torrent of death threats, rape threats, and online vitriol towards her.\nMr Trump's lawyer had argued that he should pay no further damages to Ms Carroll as her claims have \"more holes than Swiss cheese\".\nMs Habba said that her client was not to blame for the threats that Ms Carroll received.\nEarlier in the trial Judge Lewis Kaplan (no relation of the plaintiff's lawyer) advised jurors not to use their real names with each other due to the sensitive nature of the case.\nAs it concluded, he advised them that they were free to discuss their experience. But he added that in his opinion they should not tell anyone they worked on this case.\nMr Trump has repeatedly claimed the various legal cases he faces are being orchestrated by allies of US President Joe Biden, a Democrat.\nAs the Republican party's White House frontrunner, Mr Trump looks set for a rematch against Mr Biden in the November 2024 general election.\nWith reporting by Max Matza and Kayla Epstein",

But it will certainly go some way to entice people to bring these empty homes back to life and help thousands of people to have a decent home.\"\nThe authority's strategy, finance and city regeneration committee heard that the empty homes premium was expected to generate about \u00c2\u00a3500,000 from 461 properties whilst the almost 1,400 second homes were expected to generate about \u00c2\u00a31.6m.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

    "A former nuclear power station site is to be redeveloped for a new kind of nuclear technology.\nBerkeley, in Gloucestershire, was home to a Magnox reactor from 1962 to 1989.\nThe site is now owned by South Gloucestershire and Stroud College (SGS), who have agreed to sell their science park on the site to Chiltern Vital Group (CVG).\nWorking with Rolls Royce, CVG plan to establish a low-carbon energy 'super cluster' at the site.\nThe idea is to attract companies developing technology to help create so-called 'small modular reactors'.\nCVG is a leading UK developer in the zero-carbon energy, digital education and technology sectors.\nChris Turner, CEO of CVG said they were \"honoured\" to be chosen \"to deliver this international advanced zero carbon /nuclear technology park for training, FE & HE education, research and development, and applications testing.\"\n\"Small modular reactors\"\nAs the name suggests small modular reactors are smaller but also cheaper than traditional nuclear plants.\nThey would produce much less power, usually around 300 megawatts.\nHinkley Point C, in Somerset, will produce ten times that when it eventually starts generating sometime in 2030.\nBut they are also much cheaper.\nRolls Royce, who are leading the development of small reactors, estimate each one would cost about \u00c2\u00a32bn.\nWith the bill for Hinkley Point now upwards of \u00c2\u00a346bn, the small reactors are starting to look like good value for money.\nThe new developers say they want to make Berkeley a home for companies developing the technology behind these small reactors.\nIan Mean, a veteran of Gloucestershire business, who now speaks for Business West, said the announcement was \"very good news for the nuclear roadmap and our Gloucestershire economy.\"\n'Significant Milestone'\nRolls Royce are leading the development of this type of reactor in the UK,\nAlan Woods, Rolls-Royce SMR Strategy & Business Development Director welcomed the redevelopment of Berkeley.\nHe said: \"This kind of commitment, to building future nuclear skills across all levels of education, will support the roll-out of Rolls-Royce SMRs across the UK and beyond,\" he said.\nGloucestershire Science & Technology Park was set up in 2016 when the SGS Group purchased the redundant Berkeley site for \u00c2\u00a33m from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.\nKevin Hamblin, Chief Executive Officer of SGS College Group, said: \"The possible acquisition of SGS Berkeley by this Energy consortium would not just be a transaction; it would create a partnership that embodies a mutual commitment to spearheading innovations in nuclear technology.\"\n\"The sale would mark a significant milestone in the College's history, promising to create a new era of energy innovation and educational excellence in the region.\" he added.\nThe site is also home to a University Technical College (UTC), which is an initiative to focus on technical education for students between 14-18 years old and has around 400 students studying at the site.\nThe UTC is not being sold as part of this agreement, and will carry on working as before.\nFollow BBC West on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Would you mind if your mail was delivered only three days a week?\nThat's one option being proposed by watchdog Ofcom to reform the nation's postal service, over concerns the current operation is outdated and unsustainable.\nRoyal Mail has also been calling for change itself. The company has for some time questioned the UK's one-price-goes-anywhere universal postal service - an operation enshrined in law.\nSo is time running out for this British institution in a digital world?\n'No issues'\nPosties are currently required to deliver letters six days per week, Monday to Saturday.\nThe number of letters being posted, however, has halved from 14.3 billion in 2011 to 7.3 billion in 2023.\nParcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable - for Royal Mail, which has been a private business for about a decade since it was split from the Post Office.\nKarishma McGregor, from Richmond in North Yorkshire, holds the current service in high regard. \"I see our postman every morning as I work from home. He does his rounds come wind, rain, sunshine and snow. He's a great addition to the neighbourhood and the village.\"\nThe 45-year-old thinks reducing the number of delivery days would be a terrible idea, especially for elderly people who rely on letters for things like hospital appointments.\n\"If you take the Royal Mail service in the entire country, yes, there might be something that needs improvement... but I've never had any issues personally with late parcels or mail,\" she says.\nLack of service\nDespite hiking the price of stamps in recent years, Royal Mail has struggled, posting a \u00c2\u00a3319m loss in the first half of the current financial year.\nThe pandemic, industrial action and cyber-attacks have all had an impact, while cutting the number of delivery days to three could save \u00c2\u00a3400-650m, Ofcom says.\nAndy Crawford in Shaldon, Devon, isn't sure if the proposed reforms would bring improvement. His village is about one mile from a town with a sorting office, but people have been receiving their post in batches unless there is a parcel being delivered alongside them.\nThe postman in the area told him staff had been directed to prioritise \"more profitable\" parcel deliveries, he says.\n\"What my issue is more than anything else is that we pay for a service which is not being delivered in any shape or form,\" he said.\n\"We are conned into believing putting a first class stamp on a letter will get it there in good time.\"\nIt seems the majority of people agree with Mr Crawford on letters being delivered when they are meant to be, rather than frequency, being the key.\nOfcom research shows nine in 10 people think reliability is important for letter deliveries, compared to 58% for delivery on Saturdays.\nRoyal Mail is required to deliver 93% of first class post within one working day and 98.5% of second class within three working days.\nBut in 2022-23, the company delivered only 73.7% of first class and 90.7% of second class mail on time. Its performance has been so poor in recent times that Ofcom imposed a \u00c2\u00a35.6m fine over missed delivery targets last year .\nBusiness impact\nThere is also the question of what the economic impact would be if the six delivery days were cut.\nThe likes of magazine publishers would be hampered, if say, Saturday post was no more.\nSajeeda Merali, chief executive of the Professional Publishers Association, has warned that the current service must be maintained for a sector worth some \u00c2\u00a33.74bn to the UK economy.\nThe greetings card sector, which depends on a lot of people buying cards for birthdays, anniversaries and then sending them via Royal Mail, is also worried.\nWendy Jones-Blackett from Chapel Allerton, near Leeds, specialises in designing and making handmade greeting cards. She says she was \"a bit flabbergasted\" on hearing Ofcom's proposals.\nShe says roughly 50% of all greeting cards are posted, with the other half delivered by hand.\n\"We rely on Royal Mail,\" she says. \"If we do lose that six-day-a-week service there is no way it's not going to affect greeting cards,\" she says.\nHeidi Early, whose Earlybird Designs business has a shop in London, agrees. \"It's a massive part of our industry,\" she says.\n\"What is happening with this whole Ofcom thing, it all seems a bit backward. People are getting used to delivery seven days a week.\"\nShe explains in the run-up to Christmas she urged customers to send their cards earlier than usual due to the current problems with the postal system.\n\"We need to do something about this. People will start losing faith in the postal service and if they [cut deliveries], they will start to buy less cards.\"\nWhat next?\nThe fears of small businesses can be eased for now, given that the government has said it is not interested in diluting the demands placed on Royal Mail.\nMinister for Postal Affairs Kevin Hollinrake has said while there's a conversation to be had over some reforms, Saturday deliveries are \"sacrosanct\", the six-day-a-week service will remain and Royal Mail needs to \"up ",

    "The US has threatened to reinstate sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, days after the South American country's top court upheld a ban on opposition candidate Mar\u00c3\u00ada Corina Machado.\nMs Machado won a primary to become the opposition's unity candidate for the 2024 presidential election.\nBut on Friday, Venezuela's Supreme Court confirmed a 15-year ban on Ms Machado running for public office.\nVenezuela rejected the US warning as \"rude and improper blackmail\".\nThe oil industry is crucial to Venezuela's economy.\nThe US imposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector after President Nicol\u00c3\u00a1s Maduro was sworn in for a second term in 2019, after an election widely dismissed as neither free not fair.\nThe US loosened those sanctions in October after the Maduro government reached a deal with the opposition, laying some of the groundwork for free and fair presidential elections to be held in the second half of 2024.\nShortly after the deal was reached in Barbados, the US Treasury issued a licence temporarily allowing transactions involving Venezuela's oil and gas sector.\nBut it stressed at the time that the licence would only be renewed if Venezuela \"met its commitments under the electoral roadmap\", which included lifting the bans imposed on Mar\u00c3\u00ada Corina Machado and a number of other opposition candidates.\nThe oil exemption is due to expire on 18 April and on Tuesday the US state department announced it would not renew it unless \"political progress\" was made between the Maduro government and the opposition \"particularly on allowing all presidential candidates to compete in this year's election\".\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez rejected the \"ultimatum\" from the US government as \"blackmail\".\nShe threatened to immediately halt deportation flights for Venezuelan migrants who are in the US illegally if the \"economic aggression\" intensified.\nThe US had earlier announced that it would also reinstate sanctions on Venezuela's state-run gold mining company - another source of foreign currency for the Maduro government.\nMs Machado's overwhelming victory in October's opposition's primary - she received more than 90% of the votes - has instilled Venezuelans who want to see a change of government with hope that she can become president - if the election is free and fair.\nAs part of the Barbados deal, the Maduro government agreed to allow international observers to monitor the election.\nBut the fact that the Supreme Court - dominated by Maduro loyalists - has upheld the ban on Ms Machado has prompted many, including Ms Machado herself, to conclude that the Barbados deal is \"dead\".\nMs Machado has promised to stand firm, insisting that she has been given a mandate in the primary which she said she would fulfil: \"We are going to win and they must prepare to lose... They cannot hold elections without me.\"\nJorge Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez, a close ally of Mr Maduro who represented the government at the Barbados talks, insisted that the government had upheld its end of the bargain: \"Those who wanted to appeal appealed and also pledged to respect the outcome.\"",
    "Nicola Sturgeon denied presiding over a culture of secrecy despite telling the UK Covid Inquiry she deleted her WhatsApps during the pandemic.\nThe former first minister said she could not have kept secrets from the public even if she wanted to.\nShe said decisions were not made via informal messages and that they were deleted in line with government policy.\nShe also apologised if she was not \"clear\" in her previous answers about providing material to the inquiry.\nShe told Channel 4 News in August 2021 that she would provide all relevant communications to the Scottish Covid Inquiry, which is being held separately from the UK-wide inquiry.\nThe UK inquiry, which is currently sitting in Edinburgh, has previously been told by Jamie Dawson KC that Ms Sturgeon appeared to have retained no informal messages whatsoever in connection with her management of the pandemic.\nIt has been shown exchanges of messages between senior Scottish government officials, in which they were reminded that the conversations would be subject to Freedom of Information laws and were urged to delete the messages.\nOpposition parties and survivors groups have accused the government of an \"industrial-scale\" deletion policy in an attempt to avoid scrutiny.\nHowever, some Scottish government figures - including Ms Sturgeon's former chief of staff Liz Lloyd and current First Minister Humza Yousaf - have submitted text conversations with Ms Sturgeon to the inquiry.\nGiving evidence to the inquiry on Wednesday morning, Ms Sturgeon - who stepped down as first minister and SNP leader in March of last year - said she exchanged WhatsApps with no more than a \"handful\" of people, and was not a member of any groups.\nShe said her use of the app was \"extremely limited\" and did not relate to \"substantive\" government business.\nMs Sturgeon, who became tearful at points during her evidence, said she deleted these informal messages, in line with official advice, and \"salient\" points were all recorded on the corporate record.\nShe denied that deleting informal messages meant the Scottish or UK inquiries would be deprived of relevant material about how decisions were made during the pandemic.\nShe added: \"There would be nothing in those communications that was not available to either the inquiry or the public, through the record of the Scottish government, or indeed in the very detailed public statements that were being made every day.\nThe former first minister said she had been trying to answer the \"substance\" of the Channel 4 question, but said the \"literal terms\" of her answer may not have matched the question, which referred to the then first minister handing over \"emails, WhatsApps, private emails... whatever\".\n\"I accept that, and I apologise if that answer was not as clear,\" Ms Sturgeon said.\nShe also said that \"openness and transparency\" were a priority for her throughout the pandemic but that there would inevitably be cases where the government could have been more transparent.\nMs Sturgeon added: \"I would like to give an assurance to the inquiry that contrary to any desire on the part of me, or my government, to keep things secret, I would suggest the opposite was the case during the pandemic.\"\nIn her written evidence, she said decisions were \"informed, shaped and taken mainly\" through \"deep-dive\" sessions and so-called \"gold command\" meetings - attended by Ms Sturgeon, a small group of advisers and a revolving group of ministers - and cabinet meetings.\nOn Tuesday, former Deputy First Minister John Swinney told the inquiry that the decision to close schools in March 2020 was made during a conversation between him and Ms Sturgeon, rather than in a discussion involving the full cabinet.\nHe said this was because \"events were moving at an absolutely ferocious pace\".\nMs Sturgeon denied that the power of the cabinet had been \"usurped\" and relegated to a \"ratifying\" body under her leadership.\nShe told the inquiry: \"I was not given carte blanche to take any decision I wanted to take.\n\"Cabinet would say to me, we want to do this -

    "Darya Trepova will spend 27 years in a Russian jail as a terrorist for killing pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky with a concealed bomb in a cafe in St Petersburg.\nIt is one of the harshest sentences handed to a woman in Russia.\nThere is no doubt about the 26-year-old's anti-war views - she was reportedly detained at a protest early on - but friends and family have said she was not radical and not capable of murder.\nSo what do we know about her?\nAn acquaintance told the BBC that she went to school in the town of Pushkin outside St Petersburg, adding that she \"didn't seem to have any political views then\".\nOther sources say she later enrolled at St Petersburg state university's medical faculty, and she is not believed to have finished her course.\nAccording to another friend, she worked for a long time at a vintage clothes shop in the city, but left her job to move to Moscow, a month before the cafe blast.\nThe friend said she was a supporter of jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny, and also described her as \"easy to deceive\".\n\"There were many situations where Dasha, because she was so trusting and open to people, ended up in various unpleasant situations,\" she told Mediazona website.\nOn the cafe blast, Trepova told her trial she was following instructions from a man in Ukraine. She told the court she had been gullible and naive to believe him.\nTrepova is married to Dmitry Rylov, but friends have described their marriage as a sham and a \"joke\" and said they were really just friends.\nShe told the Mediazona website herself that she found the idea of anniversaries \"romantic\" but did not want to live a \"full married life\".\nThe pair were both arrested at an anti-war rally on 24 February 2022, at the start of the invasion of Ukraine.\nTrepova was detained for 10 days, apparently for ignoring police requests for the crowd to disperse.\nMr Rylov is said to be a member of a small fringe opposition group called the Libertarian Party, which was involved in the demonstrations.\nHe is thought to have emigrated when the Russian government announced plans to mobilise men of military age.\nThe party told the Telegram channel SOTA that Trepova had no connection to it, and that it condemned Tatarsky's killing.\nMr Rylov is also said to be wanted in connection with Tatarsky's killing.\nLast week, he wrote a so-called \"open letter\" on Twitter, also known as X, in which he urged a Ukrainian journalist who Trepova has accused of being involved to come forward.\n\"I ask you to tell me how it all happened ... Show screenshots of your correspondence,\" Mr Rylov said.\n\"I am almost the only person who is worried about Dasha's imprisonment and who wants her to be free,\" he went on.\nHe added that his wife was \"the most dear person in the world to me\", and he would fight for her to \"be warm, not hungry, protected and one day free\".",

    "Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has no plans to move the country's capital from Abuja to Lagos, his office says.\nThe presidency blamed political opponents for such rumours, saying \"there is no iota of truth\" in them.\nThe speculation began before Mr Tinubu, who once served as governor of Lagos, took power last May.\nIt reached fever pitch this week after it was announced that the airports agency and a central bank department were moving to Lagos.\nAbuja replaced Lagos as Nigeria's capital in 1991. It was a purpose-built, planned city - its location chosen because it is in the centre of the country, while Lagos is on the south-west coast.\nLagos, the capital during British colonial rule, remains the country's economic hub and biggest city.\nThe presidency said it had decided to issue a statement to scotch the rumours about relocating the capital as \"mischief-makers\" seemed bent on \"fuelling needless ethnic mistrust\".\n\"The people pushing the relocation narrative are playing dangerous politics, to pit the north against the south,\" said Bayo Onanuga, a presidential adviser who issued the statement.\nNigeria is split between the mainly Muslim north and largely Christian south - though Africa's most-populous nation has more than 250 ethnic groups speaking more 500 distinct languages.\nThere are three main groups: Hausa in the north, Yoruba in the west and Igbo in the east.\nIn recent years some figures from the south-west region surrounding Lagos have been calling for a separate Yoruba nation - though it is not regarded as a serious threat.\nBecause Mr Tinubu is from the Yoruba community, some fear that he would like to move the capital as part of a plan to favour the south-west over the rest of the country.\nBut this was denied by his adviser.\n\"President Tinubu-led administration is working tirelessly to be just and equitable to every section of the country,\" Mr Onanuga said.\nThe relocation of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (Faan) and the Central Bank of Nigeria's banking supervision department to Lagos was purely administrative, he added.\nYou may also be interested in:",
    "The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU).\nNorthern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal.\nIt clears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again - two years after power-sharing collapsed.\nWhy does Northern Ireland need a Brexit deal?\nTrade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules.\nHowever, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nThe EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods.\nBut the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history.\nIt was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability.\nHow will the new Northern Ireland trade deal work?\nThe new deal agreed between the UK government and the DUP - called \"Safeguarding the Union\" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland.\nThere will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes.\nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: \"We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration.\"\nThe UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK.\nA new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy.\nWhat are the Northern Ireland Protocol and Windsor Framework?\nThe first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021.\nThat introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports.\nThe checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland.\nThis angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont.\nThe protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which was adopted by the UK and EU in 2023 .\nIt created two \"lanes\" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain:\nProducts going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks.\nA ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties.\nThe Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the \"Stormont brake\", which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements .\nThat has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made.\nDespite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework, the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023 .\nThe BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.",

Reynolds has admitted he misappropriated \u00c2\u00a38,520.66.\"\nReynolds' solicitor, David Tremain, said the crime was \"highly distasteful\" given Reynolds' position and that the money was intended to benefit young children.\nThe court heard how Reynolds was addicted to gambling and had self-excluded himself from some gambling firms.\nMr Tremain said: \"[He] tried to hide from his family what was happening at work.\"\nWhen sentencing Judge Anthony Bate credited Reynolds with his early guilty plea, and for self-referring himself for rehabilitation.\nHe added that Reynolds \"must hang his head in shame\".\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "\"We're not a gang. We're a music group,\" J Emz says, unflinchingly.\n\"We're a business.\"\nThe OneFour frontman is speaking in a small, hard-to-find recording studio wedged behind a refrigerator supply store in industrial outer Sydney.\nIt's here that Australia's most successful hip-hop act is finalising their new single.\nThe question I've asked J Emz - does OneFour have gang links? - has long stalked the group.\nTo fans, the rappers are pioneers: five S\u00c4\u0081moan-Australians from one of Sydney's poorest postcodes who have used their explosive sound to give voice to millions of marginalised young people.\nBut to police, OneFour is a threat to community safety, to be managed and contained.\nFor years, they have blocked the group from performing at home by arguing their music incites violence - triggering a complex debate about art and censorship.\nViolent or visionary?\nOneFour is made up of J Emz (Jerome Misa), 25; his brother Pio \"YP\" Misa, 22;  Spencer \"Spenny\" Magalogo, 25; Salec \"Lekks\" Su'a, 27; and Dahcell \"Celly\" Ramos, 28.\nThey are the undisputed faces of Australian drill music - a subversive style of hip-hop that tells unfiltered stories of crime, poverty and social dislocation by people who have lived it.\nTheir songs have accrued more than 150 million streams and focus on their experiences growing up in Mount Druitt, a Sydney suburb which has long been the subject of stories about struggle and unemployment, not art.\nBut it's a melting pot of diverse communities, littered with family-run businesses, busy churches and mosques.\n\"A lot of people were embarrassed to say they were from Mounty growing up. I never was though, I wore it on my sleeve,\" J Emz tells me.\n\"It's home, it's family. Everything I do in life refers to where I'm from.\"\nOneFour formed in 2014. Their name is a nod to that year and - police allege - the notorious Mount Druitt street gang NF14, which has been in an ongoing war with 21 District, a rival gang from the nearby suburb of Parramatta.\nBut it was a local Mormon church choir that first brought them together as kids, J Emz explains.\nAnd it shows up in their music - which often juxtaposes heavy rap verses with soothing gospel-like vocals.\nTheir breakout moment came in 2019 with The Message, a high-octane track that went viral within days, earning the group praise from rap titans including Dave and A$AP Ferg.\nIn the track's video, dozens of young Pasifika men rally around OneFour at Mount Druitt's courthouse. Smoke billows as lyrics like \"retaliation is a must, ain't no maybes, ifs or buts\" slap in time to the beat.\nBut one now-infamous line also caught the attention of police: \"21 what, but one got knocked, ha! I guess that makes them 20.\"\nPolice said it referenced the recent murder of a 21 District member and argued that OneFour's lyrics were inciting violence.\nThe group was soon being monitored by two elite police units - Strike Force Raptor, created to hunt underground criminal networks, and Strike Force Imbara, which investigates gang feuds.\n\"I'm going to use everything in my power to make your life miserable, until you stop doing what you're doing,\" Sergeant Nathan Trueman from Raptor told the ABC in 2019, in a recorded voice memo addressed to the rappers.\nA years-long campaign to block OneFour from performing has followed, leading to the cancellation of a national tour, repeated raids on the artists' homes, and pressure on streaming services to shun their tracks.\n\"Just as police do not tolerate public acts of violence, they also won't tolerate any behaviour - including music - that clearly incites and provokes retribution and other violent behaviour,\" NSW Police said in a statement to the BBC.\nOneFour maintain their lyrics \"spread awareness of what life is like in western Sydney\" and that social commentary is not a crime.\n\"We make music about our life experiences and what we've had to go through,\" J Emz says.\n\"It's [frustrating] that people that don't even know you or want to understand your story, want to shut you down.\"\nBut a series of violent incidents involving several of the group's members have complicated the picture and increased police scrutiny.\nAll except Spenny have criminal records for drug, robbery, or assault charges. In 2019 Lekks, Celly and YP were jailed for a pub brawl in which YP wielded a chair leg and Celly hit a man with a hammer - an incident allegedly triggered by a racist slur.\nThe three were ultimately given maximum sentences of between four and eight years.\nIt's not something the group shies away from though, instead using songs like Welcome to Prison to explore the cycle of violence and incarceration that has plagued their community.\n\"I was taught from young that I'd get caught up in the system didn't listen, and that's how I got done,\" YP raps in one verse.\nJ Emz is convinced that music is their only path to a different life. \"It's a type of therapy... after releasing certain songs, there's a burden, a weight off our shoulders.\"\nAnd criminologists say the argu",
    "A council tax precept could be increased to subsidise bus fares for under-25s and pay for new bus routes.\nThe proposals would see fares cut in half to \u00c2\u00a31 for a single journey across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.\nThe combined authority said its survey about increasing the precept, which would work out at about \u00c2\u00a324 for Band D properties, was backed by the majority of the 450 respondents.\nThe plans would be discussed at a council meeting on 31 January.\nThe mayoral precept was first added to council tax bills in April 2023 at a cost of \u00c2\u00a312 for a band D property. The proposed increase to \u00c2\u00a336 would come into effect from April 2024.\nIt was initially introduced to help subsidise a number of bus routes across the county that were no longer being run by commercial operator Stagecoach.\nThe additional money that could be raised in 2024/25 would subsidise a number of new routes and enhance existing services.\nExtra evening services\nPapers released ahead of a meeting of the Combined Authority Board meeting suggested a number of possible other routes could be created.\nThese included orbital routes in Cambridge and Peterborough which avoided city centres.\nIn addition, a new \"zipper\" service between Ely and Mepal would be considered, as would extended evening services in Whittlesey.\nThe board papers also looked in to the possibility of franchising to improve bus services in the future.",
    "A hospital has had to move more of its services after crumbling concrete in a \"critical\" state was found.\nReinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) was discovered in the roof the Rockingham Wing of Kettering General Hospital (KGH).\nMaternity services had to be moved from the ward last year, and now the entire top floor will be vacated.\nChief executive Deborah Needham said: \"The safety of patients and colleagues is our number one priority\".\nRaac was widely used in the construction of public buildings from the 1950s to the 1990s, but its lifespan has largely expired - leading to many schools and other buildings across the UK being forced to close in recent times.\nThe Rockingham Wing at KGH was built in 1977 to house the maternity and gynaecology departments.\nKGH said surveyors had \"found a number of individual Raac panels which are in a critical condition\" in the roof of the wing.\nIt said the inspections had only been \"partially completed\" and further work was needed.\nThe hospital had \"run out of additional space to move teams, patients and beds around to accommodate these vital assessments,\" it added.\nMs Needham said: \"Our services are being moved to other appropriate areas so our teams can continue to deliver safe and effective care in the right environment.\"\nServices on the ground floor will continue as normal, as the ceiling does not contain the material.\nThe hospital has contacted the relatives and loved ones of patients who have been moved.\nIt said assessments of the wing would continue over the next few weeks \"to determine a long-term plan for remedial works\".\nThe hospital said it meant it had \"reduced bed capacity at a time of operational pressures\".\nLast week KGH, along with Northampton General Hospital, declared a critical incident due to a high level of admissions.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A family is aiming to raise money for life prolonging treatment so a man with an incurable brain tumour can see his rugby star daughter play for England.\nSimon Cromack, from Ashampstead in Berkshire, was diagnosed with glioblastoma in November.\nHis brother is leading the campaign in the hope he can one day see his 18-year-old daughter Ella - a fly half for Harlequins - play for the Red Roses.\nMore than \u00c2\u00a3135,000 has already been raised towards the \u00c2\u00a3250,000 target.\nMr Cromack said of his glioblastoma diagnosis: \"It's incurable, but it doesn't mean there's not a lot of time and lots of things that we can do to look at how can we keep giving myself time - and to fight this all the way.\n\"Incurable doesn't mean you can't enjoy life for a great period of time.\"\nThe 51-year-old said his wife Steph and their two daughters had been \"unbelievable\", and the family was \"remaining really positive\".\nElla said her dad's diagnosis was \"something life never really prepares you for\", and that \"words can't describe\" how proud she was of him and his attitude towards his illness.\n\"The day after [getting the diagnosis] we were talking about the Go Fund Me and how we were going to raise money, and I think the way you've been able to just flip that switch and just focus on the now and also the future is pretty inspirational,\" she told him.\nShe added that it had given her \"that drive to maybe push on even further\" in her burgeoning rugby career.\nElla has already played for England U18s in the Six Nations and recently scored her first professional try for Harlequins against Exeter.\nShe has been described as a \"rising star of the women's game\" by England Rugby, having started out at Newbury Rugby Club where her father helped out with coaching.\nMr Cromack said it would mean a \"massive amount\" to see his daughter put on the Red Roses jersey, and that he \"couldn't wait to see that happen for her\".\nWhile he said his daughter's playing career wasn't the \"be-all and end-all\",  it was \"really important to see her thrive so quickly and do it her way\", and that he and Steph were both \"exceptionally proud\".\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "\"It's important that you save your vote for the November election,\" the recorded message told prospective voters last month, ahead of a New Hampshire Democratic primary election. It sounded a lot like the President.\nBut votes don't need to be saved, and the voice was not Joe Biden but likely a convincing AI clone .\nThe incident has turned fears about AI-powered audio-fakery up to fever pitch - and the technology is getting more powerful, as I learned when I approached a cybersecurity company about the issue.\nWe set-up a call, which went like this:\n\"Hey, Chris, this is Rafe Pilling from Secureworks. I'm returning your call about a potential interview. How's it going?\"\nI said it was going well.\n\"Great to hear, Chris,\" Mr Pilling said. \"I appreciate you reaching out. I understand you are interested in voice-cloning techniques. Is that correct?\"\nYes, I replied. I'm concerned about malicious uses of the technology.\n\"Absolutely, Chris. I share your concern. Let's find time for the interview,\" he replied.\nBut this was not the real Mr Pilling. It was a demonstration laid on by Secureworks of an AI system capable of calling me and responding to my reactions. It also had a stab at imitating Mr Pilling's voice.\nListen to the voice-cloned call on the latest episode of Tech Life on BBC Sounds .\nMillions of calls\n\"I sound a little bit like a drunk Australian, but that was pretty impressive,\" the actual Mr Pilling said, as the demonstration ended. It wasn't completely convincing. There were pauses before answers that might have screamed \"robot!\" to the wary.\nThe calls were made using a freely available commercial platform that claims it has the capacity to send \"millions\" of phone calls per day, using human sounding AI agents.\nIn its marketing it suggests potential uses include call centres and surveys.\nMr Pilling's colleague, Ben Jacob had used the tech as an example - not because the firm behind the product is accused of doing anything wrong. It isn't. But to show the capability of the new generation of systems. And while its strong suit was conversation, not impersonation, another system Mr Jacob demonstrated produced credible copies of voices, based on only small snippets of audio pulled from YouTube.\nFrom a security perspective, Mr Pilling sees the ability of systems to deploy thousands of these kinds of conversational AI's rapidly as a significant, worrying development. Voice cloning is the icing on the cake, he tells me.\nCurrently phone scammers have to hire armies of cheap labour to run a mini call centre, or just spend a lot of time on the phone themselves. AI could change all that.\nIf so it would reflect the impact of AI more generally.\n\"The key thing we're seeing with these AI technologies is the ability to improve the efficiency and scale of existing operations,\" he says.\nMisinformation\nWith major elections in the UK, US and India due this year, there are also concerns audio deepfakes - the name for the kind of sophisticated fake voices AI can create - could be used to generate misinformation aimed at manipulating the democratic outcomes.\nSenior British politicians have been subject to audio deepfakes as have politicians in other nations including Slovakia and Argentina. The National Cyber Security centre has explicitly warned of the threats AI fakes pose to the next UK election.\nLorena Martinez who works for a firm working to counter online misinformation, Logically Facts, told the BBC that not only were audio deepfakes becoming more common, they are also more challenging to verify than AI images.\n\"If someone wants to mask an audio deepfake, they can and there are fewer technology solutions and tools at the disposal of fact-checkers,\" she said.\nMr Pilling adds that by the time the fake is exposed, it has often already been widely circulated.\nMs Martinez, who had a stint at Twitter tackling misinformation, argues that in a year when over half the world's population will head to the polls, social media firms must do more and should strengthen teams fighting disinformation.\nShe also called on developers of the voice cloning tech to \"think about how their tools could be corrupted\" before they launch them instead of \"reacting to their misuse, which is what we've seen with AI chatbots\".\nThe Electoral Commission, the UK's election watchdog, told me that emerging uses of AI \"prompt clear concerns about what voters can and cannot trust in what they see, hear and read at the time of elections\".\nIt says it has teamed up with other watchdogs to try to understand the opportunities and the challenges of AI.\nBut Sam Jeffers co-founder of Who Targets Me, which monitors political advertising, argues it is important to remember that democratic processes in the UK are pretty robust.\nHe says we should guard against the danger of too much cynicism too - that deepfakes lead us to disbelieve reputable information.\n\"We have to be careful to avoid a situation where rather than warning people about dangers of AI, we inadvertently caus",
    "More than 60 farmers are working together to care for rare wildlife in East Sussex.\nThe Pevensey Levels Farmers Clusters group uses sustainable methods on low lying wet grasslands at Pevensey.\nThe farmers are eligible to apply for funding from Natural England, which is only open to groups collectively farming more than 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares).\nThe funding subsidises the farming, which would be uneconomical otherwise.\nDavid Harding's organic livestock keeps the grass at the right level to help native birds such as the lapwing feed and breed.\nThe lapwing had diminished dramatically over the years, he said, with \"precious few left\".\n\"It's really trying to let the wildlife do its own thing without interfering by [using] nasty chemicals\" he said.\nHe said they had created a reed bed that was generating a huge amount of wildlife, particularly invertebrates, and could lead to the return of water voles, once the invasive mink that preyed on the rodents was eradicated.\n\"It's tiny things like the shining ram's horn snail in the ditches, and that goes all the way up to the birds,\" Mr Harding added.\nOver the past century a lot of the marshes were drained for agriculture, but these farmers work closely with environmental groups like the Sussex Wildlife Trust.\nJamie Parsons from the Trust said because droughts were becoming more and more common, \"we're seeing this site dry up and that's threatening all the rare species that rely on this wetland\".\nAs well as providing special habitats for wildlife, wetlands store carbon and stop flooding, which conservationists say are crucial elements in fighting climate change.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

    "If it wasn't for one man, Manchester United's FA Cup opponents this weekend simply would not exist.\nWhen Newport County went bust in 1989, David Hando began a battle to get his team back in the Football League, where they had been for almost 70 years.\nBut forming a new club was the start of it as the teacher led a six-year fight against the establishment and injustice that ended in the High Court.\n\"Without dad driving it, Newport County would have just died,\" said son Julian.\nWhy did Newport go to High Court?\nThe old County were founder members of the English Football League Third Division in 1920.\nBut as they were in Wales, the Welsh FA wanted the new club David helped build to play in the Welsh league system.\nIf Newport AFC had done what football's authorities wanted, then they wouldn't be hosting Manchester United - one of the world's biggest clubs - in front of a sell-out crowd on Sunday in front of Match of The Day cameras , let alone be enjoying their 11th season back in the Football League.\n\"Newport County was David's life and his mission when they folded was simple, to get Newport back to where the old club had been and that was in the Football League,\" said Mary, David's wife of almost 65 years.\nBut that was not going to be just about winning on the football field, but in the courtrooms too.\nIf they wanted to play in England, the Welsh FA told the new phoenix club they would need to play in England.\nNewport council also did not want Newport AFC to play at their old Somerton Park ground as it initially considered the new company to be a continuation of the old one and said the old club owed unpaid rent.\n\"They were already starting from scratch getting players, a manager, a kit, a name and then they then had to ring clubs in England to see who had space to let them play at their ground,\" said dad-of-three David's middle son Laurence.\nDid Newport play home games in England?\nSo in 1989, Newport were exiled to play home Federated Homes League Premier Division games in Moreton-in-Marsh in the Cotswolds in England - in a different country and about 80 miles (130km) away from the town they were representing.\nThat was something Mr Hando, a determined deputy headmaster, felt was unfair and that was when his real challenge began for a man who \"politely didn't take no for an answer\".\n\"The club was running hand to mouth and had so many obstacles, but dad had a quiet resilience that justice would eventually prevail,\" added Julian.\nSo while Manchester United started their dominance of English football which led to two Champions League wins, Hando was buying balls, flags, paying for the players' coach just to keep his new club going.\n\"Playing home games in England wasn't sustainable,\" said lawyer Charlie Hopkins who helped David and Newport take the Football Association of Wales (FAW) to the High Court.\n\"The board had no choice and nothing to lose.

    "Robert Corfield, a man who abused a boy in Canada in a secretive Christian church in the 1980s, has spoken publicly about what happened for the first time.\nHe was confronted by the BBC as part of a wider look into claims of child sexual abuse spanning decades within the church, known as The Truth.\nHis name is one of more than 700 given by people to a hotline set up to report sexual abuse within the church.\nThe sect says it addresses all abuse allegations.\nThe church, which has no official name but is often referred to as The Truth or The Way, is believed to have up to 100,000 members worldwide, with the majority in North America.\nThe potential scale of the abuse has been captured through a hotline - set-up last year by two women who say they were also sexually abused by a church leader when they were children. People have phoned in claiming they too were abused, with testimonies stretching back decades through to present day.\nThe highly secretive and insular nature of the church has helped abuse to thrive, say former and current insiders who spoke to the BBC. It has many unwritten rules, including that followers must marry within the group and keep mixing with outsiders to a minimum.\nThe church was founded in Ireland by a Scottish evangelist in 1897 and is built around ministers spreading New Testament teachings through word-of-mouth.\nOne of its hallmarks is that ministers give up their possessions and must be taken in by church members as they travel around, spreading the gospel. This makes children living in the homes they visit vulnerable to abuse, the insiders said.\nWarning: This article contains details some readers may find upsetting\nFormer church member Michael Havet, 54, told the BBC he was abused by Robert Corfield in the 1980s, from the age of 12.\n\"People called me 'Bob's little companion' - I just felt dirty and still do,\" says Mr Havet, speaking from his home in Ottawa.\nAfter abusing him, Mr Havet says Mr Corfield would force him to kneel beside him and pray.\n\"I had to work hard to get past that and find my prayer life again,\" he says.\nWhen confronted about the child abuse allegations by the BBC, Mr Corfield admitted that they had taken place for about six years in the 1980s.\n\"I have to acknowledge that's true,\" he said.\nMr Corfield was a minister - known within the sect as a \"worker\" - in Saskatchewan, Canada, at the time of the abuse.\nThis is the first time he has publicly admitted to child abuse, though he has previously been confronted by church members and wrote two private letters to Mr Havet in 2004 and 2005 which asked for forgiveness and said he was seeing a therapist. In one letter, Mr Corfield said he was \"making a list of victims\".\n\"We don't want to miss anyone who has been a victim of my actions,\" he wrote.\nHowever, when asked about this by the BBC, Mr Corfield said that there were no other victims \"in the same sense that Michael was\", and that he had given two or three other teenagers massages.\nAbuser given 'fresh start'\nMr Havet is among a dozen people who have told the BBC that widespread abuse has been ignored or covered up in The Truth for decades - with some of the accused remaining in powerful positions for years.\nThe way his own case was dealt with by the church is a prime example, believes Mr Havet.\nHe reported his abuse in 1993 to Dale Shultz, Saskatchewan's most senior church leader - known as an \"overseer\". Overseers are the most senior members of the church and there is one for each US state and Canadian province where there is an active following.\nBut Mr Shultz didn't go to the police - and, says Mr Havet, violently assaulted him a few weeks later because he thought he had told others of the abuse claims.\n\"He grabbed my shoulders yelling at me, slamming my head against a concrete pillar,\" says Mr Havet, \"splitting it open and causing it to bleed.\"\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this story, visit the BBC Action Line.\nMr Havet says Mr Shultz then \"encouraged\" him to leave the church - while his childhood abuser, Robert Corfield, was just moved to be a minister across the border, in the US state of Montana.\nMr Corfield told the BBC that he believed it was Mr Shultz's decision to send him to Montana, where he remained in post for 25 years.\n\"It was suggested it would give me a fresh beginning and probably also put space between me and the victim,\" he said.\nMr Corfield was removed as minister last year after being confronted about Michael's abuse by another congregation member, according to internal church emails seen by the BBC. One email also suggested \"it is possible there may be additional victims\".\nThe ex-minister told the BBC that he \"voluntarily stepped down when the accusations of Michael were presented\" against him, and that he had \"not been informed of any allegations beyond that.\"\nWhen contacted by the BBC, Dale Shultz said via email that \"much of the information that you have received concerning me is distorted and inaccurate\". However he declined to",

    "What will be one of the most ambitious and most expensive space missions ever mounted by Europe has just been given the formal green light.\nThe Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (Lisa) will try to detect ripples in the fabric of space-time generated when gargantuan black holes collide.\nThese gravitational waves will be sensed by three spacecraft firing lasers at each other over a distance of 2.5 million km (1.5 million miles).\nThe cost will run into the billions.\nScientists believe that studying gravitational waves will help answer important questions about the workings and history of the Universe.\nOfficials at the European Space Agency (Esa) forecast a budget of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.75bn (\u00c2\u00a31.5bn; $1.9bn), with additional contributions coming from member states including Germany, France, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The US space agency (Nasa) will be a major partner, too.\nWhile this sum is considerable, it does represent a life-time cost - and the complexity of the mission means it will not launch before 2035 at the earliest.\nEsa's director of science, Prof Carole Mundell, likened the cost to each European citizen to that of a cup of coffee, and she hoped they would agree with her that this represented great value for money.\n\"We're trying to solve some of the big mysteries of physics,\" she told BBC News.\n\"How do we go beyond Einstein's theory of general relativity (his theory of gravity)? How do we probe the nature of space-time? How do we understand the most violent collisions in the Universe, between supermassive black holes? So, you bring together what is almost science fiction and the science engineering, and we make it a science reality.\"\nGravitational waves are a prediction of Einstein's equations.\nThey are the ripples of energy that spread across the cosmos at the speed of light when masses accelerate.\nThe waves were first detected in Earth laboratories in 2015 . They were produced by the coming together of black holes that were a few times the mass of our Sun.\nGoing into space with detectors will allow researchers to sense much longer wavelength phenomena.\n\"It's all about size. With Lisa we're talking about sensing the coming together of black holes that are millions of times the mass of our Sun,\" said Prof Harry Ward from Glasgow University, UK.\nScientists are particularly keen to study these supermassive objects because their creation and evolution seems to be tied inextricably to that of the galaxies that host them, and probing their properties would therefore reveal details about how the great structures we see on the sky took shape through cosmic history.\nOn Earth, gravitational waves are detected from the perturbations they induce in the path of laser light as it is fired down 4km-long, L-shaped tunnels.\nLisa will use the same principle but fire its beams over a much greater distance, and between three identical spacecraft arranged as an equilateral triangle.\nAstonishing measurement precision is needed because although the waves come from colossal sources, their signal is tiny - just fractions of the width of an atom.\nScientists talk about picometres, which are a trillionths of a metre.\n\"If you scale it up, it's the equivalent to measuring the change in distance to Alpha Centauri to about the thickness of a piece of paper,\" said Dr Ewan Fitzsimons at the UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UK ATC). Alpha Centauri encompasses the closest star system to Earth and is more than four light-years away.\nLisa has already been in development for decades, and has gone through various ups and downs, not least with the participation of the Americans. They've been in and out, but are now fully back on board, and will bring important technologies, including the lasers.\nEsa's Science Programme Committee (SPC) selected Lisa as a candidate mission in 2017. Since then the agency's technical staff, with support from European industry and academia, have been studying whether the mission is actually feasible. A positive assessment has now allowed Esa delegations to formally \"adopt\" the project.\nThe UK Space Agency has given its support although this has the reservation that a business case still needs to be made to His Majesty's Treasury. This will be submitted shortly and a decision is expected before the end of the year, after which Esa will look to place the major industrial contracts across Europe.\nBritain is set to provide what are called the optical benches in the spacecraft. These are the mirror systems that corral the laser light beams so their behaviour can be precisely monitored. One of the main data distribution centres will also be hosted in the UK.\nThursday's SPC meeting also adopted the Venus mission concept called Envision .",

    "Channel 4 has announced plans to cut 200 jobs as it seeks a leaner organisation with a focus on digital services.\nAlong with the closure of about 40 unfilled posts, that equates to a loss of 18% of the current workforce.\nChief executive Alex Mahon said: \"I am very sad that some of our excellent colleagues will lose their jobs.\n\"But the reality of the rapid downshift in the economy and advertising market demand we must change structurally.\"\nShe said in a statement that the new strategy meant Channel 4 would remain \"a trusted, disruptive and distinctive brand\".\nThe British broadcaster wants digital revenues - which accounted for 27% of its total last year - to pass 50% by 2030.\nIn November, Ms Mahon said the TV industry was reeling from the worst advertising downturn since 2008 and expected the company to make losses in each of the next two years.\nChannel 4 is publicly owned but not publicly funded, relying heavily on advertising revenues.\nThe wave of cuts is likely to put pressure on London-based staff, after the broadcaster reiterated its commitment to moving 600 roles out of the city by 2025.\nIts current headquarters on Horseferry Road will be closed, and a new office space found in the centre of the capital.\nThe channel, which launched in 1982, has already cut its \u00c2\u00a3713m programming budget, and shows including SAS: Who Dares Wins, The Big Narstie Show and Steph's Packed Lunch have been axed.\nIt said on Monday that there would be a \"ruthless focus on cut-through, with fewer, stronger new titles that generate more scale and impact\".\nAfter plans to privatise Channel 4 were dropped by the government last year, the broadcaster has been exploring ways to transition into digital broadcasting in order to compete with online streaming services.\nIt said its digital-first strategy would mean investment in programming that drives growth, such as drama, high-end documentaries, comedy and reality, while targeting younger viewers on platforms such as YouTube.",

    "Like many farmers, in France and far beyond, Yves Copp\u00c3\u00a9 finds much to worry about these days. If you ask him to list his troubles, he likes to start with a story about hundreds of thousands of missing baguettes.\nStanding by a huge barn on a gentle green hillside, some 120km (75 miles) southeast of Paris, the 39-year-old surveyed the 300 hectares, of wheat, rape seed and a few other crops, that he inherited from his parents. An engraving on an old stone arch nearby dates the farm's origins back to 1787.\n\"It's just not sustainable,\" he said.\nCopp\u00c3\u00a9 was just back from helping to organise one of the nationwide protests that has seen farmers block French motorways with tractors and bales of hay. He's the head of the local young farmers' association in the Seine-et-Marne department, which has been closely involved in co-ordinating the convoys of farm vehicles.\n\"Don't your English farmers do this?\" he asked, explaining that such organised demonstrations and disruptions have always been the way that he and his colleagues got their government's attention.\nCopp\u00c3\u00a9 and his neighbours, farming downstream from the French capital, have many concerns. Even this summer's Olympic Games are a source of worry, since the organisers are planning to block the River Seine for water sports at a time when farmers need the river to transport their grain by barge.\n\"The officials asked us to delay the harvest,\" he laughed, as if such an impossible request summed up the ignorant attitude of some French government bureaucrats.\nCopp\u00c3\u00a9, who quit his job as a manager with the car manufacturer Renault eight years ago to take over the family farm, is concerned about new data that shows around half of all French farmers will be retiring in the course of the next decade, and the industry is failing to recruit enough young farmers to replace them.\nBut who would become a farmer today, he wondered, when profits are so hard to find, prices for the huge machinery required are rising so fast, and the job now requires dozens of hours of paperwork every week?\nFundamentally, though, Copp\u00c3\u00a9's concerns boiled down to a sense of injustice - the belief that French farmers are no longer competing on a level playing field.\n\"We all support the European Union, but we need it to have a stable framework that suits all of its member states. France tends to add extra burdens to the EU's rules so we find ourselves with unfair competition. We're not playing by the same rules,\" Copp\u00c3\u00a9 explained.\nAnd that applies beyond the EU's borders too.\n\"Products travel around the planet, sometimes 10,000km, and they arrive here with a lower price tag than our own products,\" he said, citing countries like Canada and New Zealand which are often mentioned as having different standards to French produce.\nBut what about those French baguettes?\nAs part of the European Union's plans to meet climate commitments, it has introduced new rules requiring farmers to leave 4% of their land unused, or fallow.\nCopp\u00c3\u00a9 reckons that means he's unable to plant wheat on the equivalent of 16 football fields, which translates into \"100 tonnes of grain, which is the equivalent of 80 tonnes of flour, which makes 300,000 baguettes. And this is just from my small farm - 300,000 baguettes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. A large amount of unmade goods that would, potentially, be imported into the EU. It's not sustainable. We don't follow the logic,\" Copp\u00c3\u00a9 declared.\nHe insisted he was all in favour of tackling climate change, but that the set-aside rule made no practical sense.\n\"We do have an ecological perspective. But we can't forget the economic side. Without that, we can't survive,\" he said.\nSo, what of the new moves outlined on Thursday by France's new prime minister, Gabriel Attal, in response to the farmers' protests? Mr Attal - at 34, he's five years younger than Copp\u00c3\u00a9 - has promised to reassert French \"sovereignty\" over food production, and to tighten import controls.\n\"It makes no sense to ban pesticides in France before such decisions are taken on an EU level, we will end this practice,\" Attal said.\nOn his farm, Copp\u00c3\u00a9 gave the new prime minister credit for \"listening. We can't take that away from him.\"  He said he was proud of the protesters and pleased by the warm reaction of the French public.\n\"I've never seen so many tractors out,\" he said.\nBut Copp\u00c3\u00a9 expressed wariness about changes getting bogged down at the European level, with all 27 nations needing to approve legislation regarding the 4% rule. \"We still need to convince a few countries for changes to happen,\" he warned, still worried about all those missing baguettes.",

    "When it comes to fighting games, Japan's Tekken series is one of the heavyweights.\nFirst launched 30 years ago, the beat 'em up franchise released its eighth numbered instalment last week to rave reviews.\nAnd to mark the occasion the publisher behind the game, Bandai Namco, has released a single - Tekken 8 (The Anthem).\nBut instead of using a Japanese artist it's turned to rapper D Double E and producer Fumez The Engineer from the UK's grime scene.\nAnd if you know anything about the history of the British fighting game community (FGC), that probably isn't a surprise.\nKobi Scarlett, better known as K-Wiss, has been playing Tekken since he was a child thanks to his dad.\nHe's now one of the top Tekken players in the world, competing in and commentating on the biggest global esports tournaments.\nAnd he says he's building on a legacy that started in his hometown.\n\"If you go back to the early arcade scene in London, the scene was very black,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.\nKobi's talking about venues around the city where groups of fighting game lovers would spend hours with pockets full of change waiting to take each other on.\nHe says some of the scene's top players now work for companies producing fighting games or putting on events.\nAnd he says it's reflected in other forms of entertainment.\n\"So you see it in hip hop, you see it in rap, you see it mentioned by all these,\" he says, adding that the release of Tekken \"is a bit of a cultural moment\".\nCombos and collabs\nGrime producer Fumez is another Londoner who says Tekken was his \"childhood game\".\nNow 30, he's worked on tracks from some of the biggest artists on the UK's drill scene, including Central Cee, and says getting a chance to work on TEKKEN 8 (The Anthem) - \"feels very special\".\nSpeaking to BBC Newsbeat at his studio in north-west London, Fumez says it's \"a modern day drill/grind fusion upbeat\" sound, with lots of references to the game.\nAnd he knows the track will have to be strong to stand up to Tekken's regular soundtrack, known for its high quality.\n\"A game is continuously played, so these are the tracks that live with you throughout that Tekken journey,\" he says.\nLike Kobi, Fumez is building on a long-standing crossover between fighting games and music, with many rappers and MCs referencing the genre in their lyrics.\nNicki Minaj mentioned Chun-Li from Street Fighter in 2018, and Dave's 2017 track Six Paths includes the lyrics \"dress in black with a bottle in hand like Lei Wulong\", the Tekken character known for his \"drunken fist\" moves.\nAnd D Double E, the MC on TEKKEN 8 (The Anthem) has also previously recorded bars about a rival fighting game.\nHis 2010 track Street Fighter Riddim was filled with references to that series, but his latest set of lyrics required him to get up to speed with 30 years of plot points from Tekken.\nBut he thinks it will be worth it to expose the rest of the world to the UK's growing drill and grime scene.\n\"It's exciting, because sometimes when you do your music you're banging on the same door unless you try to branch out,\" he says.\n\"This is one of these pinnacle moments.\"\nSince those early days in the arcades, the competitive Tekken scene has moved towards consoles and online match-ups.\nDespite an almost seven-year wait since the last game, Tekken 7, in 2017, the game's stayed popular thanks to global tournaments and views on streams.\nTyrone, better known as Arsenalty on Twitch, says that's partly because the game has always made an effort to feel international.\n\"The characters are from all over the world, and when they're speaking in the game, they speak in their native language,\" he says.\nSo it makes sense to him that the world of the fighting game would collide with the UK grime scene in the way it has.\n\"Tekken has historically had really good music,\" says Tyrone. \"I think they recognise how much the grime scene is growing, and they're exploring different types of music.\"\nIt's a full-circle moment, with the artists influenced by the series now making tracks about it.\n\"I feel as though there's so many iconic characters in Tekken it's easy to integrate them into music,\" says Tyrone.\n\"A lot of people growing up would have been playing Tekken in the 90s - 8.5 million sold on the PlayStation 1.\n\"And I think as these artists grew up they would have included in their music as they got older.\n\"It was one of those games where it had such a big cultural impact.\"\nThe video for TEKKEN 8 (The Anthem) is available on YouTube .\nFollow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube .\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",

    "The outskirts of the Lake District National Park may seem far removed from Rugby League's best known names, like Wigan and St Helens.

    "A woman who drove at her fiance before dragging him more than 150m along a road has been jailed for a minimum of 18 years for his murder.\nAlice Wood and her partner Ryan Watson had been arguing after a party in May 2022, but she claimed his death was a \"tragic accident\".\nWood, 24, was found guilty last month at Chester Crown Court, where she was sentenced to life on Friday.\nJurors heard she drove at Mr Watson three times before he was killed.\nSentencing her, Judge Michael Leeming said: \"Prison may be hard for you, Alice Wood, but you only have yourself to blame for the situation you now find yourself in.\"\nThe couple had attended the party with staff and service users of brain injury charity Headway, where 24-year-old Mr Watson was a support worker.\nBut jurors heard he \"clicked\" with another woman at the party in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, angering Wood.\nAndrew Ford KC, prosecuting, said Mr Watson was seen on CCTV footage \"having a good time, being a gregarious and outgoing party guest\" while Wood was described by one woman attending as \"a bit cold\".\nTiffany Ferriday, a guest at the gathering, said she and Mr Watson had \"clicked\" and Wood was \"pretty much left out\" of conversation.\nWood, who was due to sit exams in theology, philosophy and ethics and had a scholarship for a part-time research masters at Cambridge, had accused him of flirting with her.\nTension had also been building between the pair - who had both been drinking alcohol - in an argument over who was driving home.\nWood told the court that when she drove Mr Watson home in his car, he \"flipped\" and accused her of flirting with other men.\nAt their home in Oak Street, Rode Heath, she got into her car as Mr Watson walked around the vehicle.\nNeighbours reporting hearing shouting, doors slamming, and a car engine revving, jurors heard.\nWood then \"used her car as a weapon\", reversing towards Mr Watson, narrowly missing him, before, seconds later, driving at him again, knocking him onto her car's bonnet.\nShe drove at him for a third time, this time dragging him underneath the vehicle.\n'I deserve it'\nAfter driving 158m along the road, Wood then stopped and asked a nearby resident \"please phone an ambulance, I think I've run over my boyfriend\".\nParamedics confirmed Mr Watson had died, with the cause confirmed as crush asphyxiation, the Crown Prosecution (CPS) said.\nThe court heard Wood wrote a letter to the judge saying she accepted sole responsibility but continued to deny murder, maintaining she used her car only as a weapon for intimidation.\nGudrun Young KC, defending, said the couple appeared to be very much in love and had not long bought the house together and had talked about starting a family.\nWood did not intend to kill Mr Watson and her expressions of remorse at the scene and since were genuine, she added.\n\"The reality is that she has lost the man she loved and will have to live the rest of her life with the knowledge that it was at her hand,\" she said.\nJudge Leeming told her he was sure there was intent on her behalf to kill Mr Watson.\n\"In the heat of the moment and having failed to injure him in the first strike, this time you made no mistake. I am sure that there was an intent to kill.\"\nHe said he did not accept Wood was provoked by Mr Watson or in fear of violence from him that night.\n'No remorse'\n\"Ryan Watson was vulnerable. He was a pedestrian, he was holding his mobile phone, he was standing on the pavement, he had been drinking.\n\"There was nothing he could do to avoid the fatal act.\n\"To my mind you have shown no true remorse for Ryan's murder.\"\nDavid Jones, a senior CPS prosecutor, said it was \"a tragic loss of life\" of a young man with his whole life ahead of him.\n\"Though it will never make up for their devastating loss, I hope today's conviction brings Ryan's family some solace, knowing his murderer has been brought to justice,\" he said.\nMr Watson's mother, Lisa Watson, read her victim personal statement read from the witness box in which she said \"my world stopped\" from the moment she got a knock on her door to say her son had been killed.\nShe said Wood's actions \"showed how little she cared for Ryan\".\n\"My family had been destroyed in an instance and it hurt even more hearing who had killed him,\" she said.\n\"The one person Ryan trusted the most is the person who took his life in such a violent way.\"\nWood wiped away tears as Mr Watson's younger brother, Owen, told the court: \"Now Ryan has gone the happiness has turned into darkness.\n\"Without him I will never be the same again. I have lost my best friend, the happy place in my heart.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , X and Instagram . Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",

    "A review of the decision by prosecutors to accept manslaughter pleas in the Nottingham attacks case has been ordered by the attorney general.\nBarnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, were fatally stabbed on 13 June along with Ian Coates, 65.\nTheir killer, Valdo Calocane, was given a hospital order after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.\nThe review will also look into how the victims' families were consulted.\nAttorney General Victoria Prentis said she ordered the urgent review of the Crown Prosecution Service's (CPS) handling of the case.\nShe has asked His Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate to carry out the review, adding: \"The senseless deaths of Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates have horrified the country.\n\"While nothing will bring their loved ones back, the families understandably want to understand what happened in this case.\n\"That's why I have asked the inspectorate to carry out a prompt and thorough review of CPS actions.\"\nResponding to the attorney general's decision, the families said they were \"united as families in this national tragedy\".\n\"We reiterate our deep and grave concerns in this case, and our disappointment that we have had to resort to this additional level of trauma and stress to feel listened to and for further actions to be taken,\" a joint statement read.\n\"The families welcome a full, open and transparent investigation and also ask that they are given the opportunity to discuss, in person, the concerns and evidence of concerns that they have with the IOPC and the attorney general.\"\nIt also said the families were invited to meet Janine McKinney, chief crown prosecutor, and Nottinghamshire Police's Chief Constable Kate Meynell.\n\"Whilst these invitations are welcome, the families would comment that these concerns were raised repeatedly over the past few months and the opportunity to meet has only been forthcoming at this late stage, when perhaps the horse has already bolted,\" the statement said.\n\"The united families of Grace, Barnaby and Ian are grateful to the public for their continued support and extraordinary compassion shown to them during the past seven tragic months.\"\nThe families have called for a public inquiry into the case and met Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday to discuss their concerns.\nIn an interview with ITV's This Morning on Tuesday, Mr Sunak said he promised that \"we will get the answers\".\n\"What they've expressed to me are a bunch of questions about what's happened that they have,\" he said.\n\"How did the NHS operate? Was mental health properly checked? How was the police investigation conducted? How was the Crown Prosecution Service operating and interacting with them?

    "On opposite sides of the world, Richard Scolyer and Georgina Long each took one look at a scan and their hearts sank.\nIn front of them was, to the untrained eye, an innocuous-looking brain.\nBut these long-time friends - both leading skin cancer doctors - feared it held a ticking time bomb.\nNestled in the top right corner of Prof Scolyer's skull was a section of matter lighter and cloudier than the rest.\n\"I'm no expert in radiology, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 in my heart I knew it was a tumour,\" he tells the BBC.\nNeurosurgeons soon confirmed it wasn't just any brain tumour, but \"the worst of the worst\" - a subtype of glioblastoma so aggressive most patients survive less than a year.\nDevastated but determined, he and Prof Long set out to do the impossible: to save his life by finding a cure.\nAnd it may sound crazy, but the Australian researchers have done it before, with melanoma.\n\"It didn't sit right with me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to just accept certain death without trying something,\" Prof Scolyer says.\n\"It's an incurable cancer? Well bugger that!\"\nNational treasures\nThirty years ago, when Prof Scolyer and Prof Long met as bright, young doctors, advanced melanoma was a death sentence.\nBut that's exactly what drew them to it.\nAustralia has long had the highest rate of the skin cancer on the planet and where many saw a daunting challenge, they saw potential.\n\"[Back] when I was doing the cancer block the most challenging patients to see were the ones with advanced melanoma. It was heartbreaking,\" Prof Long says.\n\"I wanted to make a difference.\"\nToday, it's near impossible to overstate their impact on the field.\nAnyone who gets a diagnosis or treatment for melanoma worldwide does so because of the work pioneered by the Melanoma Institute that they now lead.\nOver the past decade, their team's research on immunotherapy, which uses the body's immune system to attack cancer cells, has dramatically improved outcomes for advanced melanoma patients around the world. Half are now essentially cured, up from less than 10%.\nThat breakthrough - or as Prof Long calls it, \"penicillin moment\" - is now being applied to many other cancers, saving even more lives.\nIt has made the duo national treasures. Almost every Australian would know someone impacted by their work and this year they've been jointly named as the Australians of the Year.\nBut as they were transforming the field, they were also leaving their mark on each other.\nThey bonded over frustration at the cases they couldn't crack, the highs of life-changing discoveries, a love of exercise, and a lofty ambition of reaching zero melanoma deaths in Australia.\n\"We're very different but very similar in that sort of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 roll up your sleeves, get things done way,\" Prof Long says.\nEyes shining, the medical oncologist rattles off a list of qualities - brave, honest, upbeat, driven - which make Prof Scolyer the dream colleague and friend.\n\"He's a delight,\" she surmises.\nAnd so, after she received that fateful call from Poland last June - where Prof Scolyer was on holiday when a seizure triggered his diagnosis - she spent the night crying.\n\"I'm grieving\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I'm thinking my friend is going to be gone in 12 months.\"\nBut then she spent the morning plotting - poring over textbooks, researching clinical trials, and firing off emails to colleagues globally.\nGlioblastomas, found in the brain's connective tissue, are notoriously aggressive and the general protocol for treating them - immediate excision then radiotherapy and chemotherapy - has changed little in two decades.\nSurvival rates have fared similarly. Still, only 5% of all patients live beyond five years.\nDesperate, Prof Long formulated a radical plan to treat Prof Scolyer based on what had worked in melanoma, but which had never been tested in brain cancer.\nRisk vs reward\nIn melanoma, Prof Long and her team discovered that immunotherapy works better when a combination of drugs are used, and when they are administered before any surgery to remove a tumour.\nIt's like training a sniffer dog, she explains: you give it a smell of the contraband, in this analogy the cancer cells, for it to be able to hunt them down later.\nProf Scolyer jokes that trying the treatment was a \"no brainer\".\nBut it comes with huge risks.\nSome oncologists were sceptical that the drugs would reach his brain at all, and even if they did, that his immune system would respond.\nAnd they worried the experiment could kill him faster.\nMany brain cancers grow so rapidly that even a two-week delay to surgery could mean it's too late to operate, they said. Immunotherapy drugs are quite toxic, especially when mixed, so he could be poisoned. And if either of those things caused the brain to swell, he could die instantly.\nAt home colleagues quietly shared fears Prof Long's emotional ties were clouding her judgement.\n\"They were saying\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 'Just let the neuro-oncology experts do their thing and be his friend',\" she says.\n\"[But] he needs us\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We have all this depth of knowledge, it's our duty.\"\nAnd so, under the care",
    "A jury has visited the South Lanarkshire woods where the body of Emma Caldwell was found in May 2005.\nThe jurors, as well as court staff, judge Lord Beckett and the man accused of killing the former sex worker were driven the 41 miles from Glasgow High Court to Limefield Woods in Biggar.\nThe jury was told the site visit was to allow them to see the remote location for themselves.\nIain Packer denies killing Ms Caldwell and 45 charges against 27 other women.\nA convoy of 10 police motorcycles escorted members of the jury to the site as they left Glasgow at about 10:30.\nThey were driven down the M74, then along country roads through the village of Rigside.\nThe jurors then travelled a further three-miles down isolated country roads, with each turn taking them further off the beaten track.\nThere is little to see in the surrounding area apart from a quarry, a handful of cottages and flocks of sheep a few miles away.\nThe area is heavily wooded, with what lies between the trees barely visible from the single-track road which runs through it.\nMarkers were placed through the wooded area to highlight a path for the jurors through the sometimes marshy ground.\nThe jury was guided into the woods and briskly walked around the marked path twice, pausing to look into the ditch where Ms Caldwell's body was found 18 years ago.\nThe trial this week heard from dog walker Neil Borland who had found the body of Miss Caldwell in May 2005. He described her as lying \"face down\" between lines of trees and \"unclothed\".\nThe witness described the location as being in the \"middle of nowhere\".\nThe accused, Iain Packer, was escorted into the woods by three prisoner transport staff. His left hand was cuffed and he was holding a walking stick in his right hand.\nMr Packer stared into the distance as the jury passed him and kept a stern expression throughout.\nBy 11:49 the jury was back on the bus and escorted back down the single track road.\nOnce at the site, the visit lasted less than five minutes.\nUnusual occasion\nBefore leaving the High Court in Glasgow, Lord Beckett told jurors they were not to take \"the role of detectives or investigators\" while at Limefield.\nHe laid out what he described as \"ground rules\" for the trip.\nThe judge said: \"The purpose of it is to allow you to see the location and see features along the roads that you have heard about.\n\"You may find, that having been to the woods, it will aid your understanding for some of the evidence and what can be inferred from what you have heard.\"\nEach member of the jury was given an A4 map of the area they would be visiting.\nBut, Lord Beckett cautioned jurors that evidence in the case had not yet been completed and that they must not reach a \"final judgement\" at this time.\nJury site visits are relatively uncommon but have been carried out during a number of high-profile trials such as the World's End and the Jodi Jones murder trials.\nFor a short time, Limefield Woods became a part of the High Court which means the media in attendance had to follow usual court reporting restrictions.\nIt was also unusual in the fact that High Court judge, Lord Beckett and lawyers were temporarily de-robed and without their wigs, as they wore clothing more appropriate for the muddy terrain.\nAdult party\nAfter jurors returned from the site visit they heard evidence from a woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted by Iain Packer at an \"adult party\" at a farm to the north of Glasgow in 2013.\nShe was in a room with her husband when Mr Packer and a woman came in.\nThey swapped partners and the witness initially engaged in consensual contact.\nBut, the woman - now aged 46 - said it quickly became \"hard\" and \"uncomfortable\". This allegedly included him putting his hand over her mouth.\nShe recalled: \"I was starting to say 'no'. He just kept going.\"\nThe witness said she protested \"more than once\".\nThe woman added she tried to get her husband's attention, but \"could not move much\".\nThe trial continues.",
    "The trial of a mother and father accused of killing their baby has been told she was \"well cared for\" by her parents.\nConstance Marten, 36, and Mark Gordon, 49, are on trial for the manslaughter of newborn Victoria, whose body was discovered in a Lidl 'bag for life' in March 2023.\nMr Gordon's lawyer suggested they were \"driven off grid\" after police began a weeks-long search for the family.\nThe pair deny the charges.\nMs Marten and Mr Gordon were arrested near Brighton on 27 February 2023, and their baby's body was discovered two days later in a nearby shed.\nThe trial has previously heard the couple were living rough in a bid to evade social services as they feared their newborn child would be removed.\nProsecutors allege the baby died as a result of living outdoors in wintry conditions, but in an opening address to the jury, John Femi-Ola KC, who is defending Mr Gordon, said: \"The baby was kept warm and dry, and was fed such as she was well-nourished. The baby did not require medical assistance.\"\nHe said there was no evidence of any sign of violence, and no sign of external or internal injuries.\nMr Femi-Ola said there was no intention by the couple to pervert the course of justice by deliberately allowing Victoria's body to decompose, because Ms Marten wanted a post-mortem examination to know \"how her beloved baby died\".\nOn Friday, the jury was also played footage taken by Ken Hudson, a motorist who passed the couple's car after it burst into flames on the M61 in Greater Manchester on 5 January.\nMr Hudson told the court he pulled over and dialled 999, then saw a man \"frantically\" removing possessions from the burning car, and a woman with a baby getting out.\nMs Marten told him the infant was fine, Mr Hudson said, and that he did not need to wait with them any longer by the side of the road.\nIn the footage, Mr Hudson can be heard refusing an offer from Mr Gordon of money in exchange for a possible lift to the nearest service station. The lift never happened, he said.\nAsked if he heard any noise or movement from the baby, he said \"none whatsoever\", and told the court he put his hand on the infant's head and said \"God bless\".\nMr Hudson said the baby \"felt quite cold, but it was January, and it didn't move at all\", adding he was \"cut up because I believe that if I stayed with the vehicle, the baby may be still alive.\"\nHe rejected the defence's suggestion Ms Marten would not have allowed a stranger to place his hand on the baby's head, and maintained the exchange happen.\nThe prosecution maintains baby Victoria would still be alive were it not for the \"reckless, utterly selfish, callous, cruel, arrogant and ultimately grossly negligent conduct\" of her parents.\nOutlining the case against the defendants on Thursday, prosecutor Tom Little KC told jurors the couple previously had four other children, all of whom had been taken into care after extensive involvement from social services.\nThe court has heard the couple were living in a tent on the South Downs - which the prosecution says deprived the baby of what it needed, namely warmth, food and safety.\nMr Little said the conditions the defendants were living when sleeping rough \"rapidly worsened and quickly reached a stage that were inhuman\", and accused them of putting their \"own relationship and desires over the safety and wellbeing of their baby\".\nBut Mr Femi-Ola for the defence said: \"The Crown say they went off the grid. As you listen to the evidence, you may ask yourself: were they driven off the grid?\"\nOn Thursday, jurors were told Ms Marten comes from a privileged background and had access to money.\nThe court was also told Ms Marten received \u00c2\u00a315,590 from \"Hoare Trustees\" into her bank account on 22 December. She received a further \u00c2\u00a33,400 from the \"Sturt Trust\" on 3 January.\nAs well as manslaughter, the couple are also accused of four other offences - cruelty to their baby; concealment of the baby's birth; causing or allowing her death; and perverting the course of justice by concealing the body.\nThe trial continues.",

I want them to learn it so that one day they'll be able to do it.\"\nFor Prof Abu Bilal his joint career suits him perfectly, as he is able to embrace his teaching role on both fronts: \"I love to impart knowledge.\"\nYou may also be interested in:",

    "The family of a 93-year-old killed in her care home by a younger resident has condemned a proposal to allow the killer to spend time outside the secure hospital where he is held.\nAlexander Rawson, then 62, beat Eileen Dean with a walking stick at the south-east London home in 2021.\nHe was sentenced to indefinite detention in a secure hospital.\nMrs Dean's daughter, Georgina Hampshaw, says the proposal to allow him escorted leave is \"ill-conceived and abhorrent\".\nRawson was deemed unfit to stand trial for murder and instead, in November 2021, an Old Bailey jury listened to the evidence and decided he was responsible for the killing, a procedure known as a trial of the facts.\nThe judge gave Rawson an indefinite hospital order.\nMrs Dean's family has been told a request has now been submitted to the Ministry of Justice for Rawson to go on escorted leave into the community, accompanied by hospital staff.\nIn line with regulations, his doctor must have the request approved by the justice secretary.\n'Beggars belief'\nIn her response to the Ministry of Justice, Ms Hampshaw has denounced the proposal as ill-conceived and abhorrent.\nShe writes that it \"beggars belief that his clinicians are now of the opinion that he is apparently well enough to be given escorted leave\".\nReferring to the case of Valdo Calocane, who killed three people in Nottingham last year, she says: \"The families of those who die at the hands of killers with mental health issues are treated with complete and utter contempt.\"\nLike the families of Calocane's victims, Mrs Dean's family feel Rawson cheated justice by not going through a murder trial.\nThe Ministry of Justice said: \"This was a horrific crime and our thoughts remain with Mrs. Dean's family and friends.\n\"Applications for escorted leave from mental health hospitals are made by doctors, but public protection will always be our priority and we refuse those which would put the public at risk.\"\nRawson, who had a history of mental health problems caused by alcoholism, was moved into the room next to Mrs Dean at the Fieldside care home in Catford a few days before Christmas 2020.\nIn the first week of 2021, he went into Mrs Dean's room at night and attacked her with a metal walking stick, inflicting catastrophic injuries to her head and body. She died later in hospital.\nAfter the attack, Rawson phoned 999 and said: \"I think somebody's been killed and I don't know what's happening.\"\nIn a review published in November 2022,  the Lewisham Safeguarding Adults Board described how Rawson had been moved into Fieldside after being an inpatient at a psychiatric unit run by the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.\nThe home was the only place that agreed to take him after his discharge from hospital.\nIn the months before his attack on Mrs Dean, while he was in hospital, Rawson was involved in at least 34 recorded incidents of violence or threats to patients and health staff, including a threat to kill. The review revealed how no formal risk assessment was done before his move to the care home.\nThe Ministry of Justice said it did not comment on individual cases. It said the granting of leave was usually subject to strict conditions and the justice secretary had a role in this.\nGovernment guidance states that patients on escorted leave must stay in the custody of escorts, who have the power to restrain them. It is for the hospital to assess the number of escorts required.\nAn inquest into Mrs Dean's death is due in February 2024.",
    "A former RAF officers' mess in North Lincolnshire has been given protected status to prevent it from being redeveloped.\nNorth Lincolnshire Council has awarded asset of community value status to the Kirton in Lindsey site.\nIt means local community groups have to be allowed to bid if it is put up for sale.\nA previous application for the officers' mess was turned down in 2022 as it was being used for RAF functions.\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service , recent RAF closures elsewhere in Lincolnshire mean the Kirton in Lindsey facility is no longer needed by the Ministry of Defence.\nThree former MoD facilities including the Vincent Hall, sports field and tennis courts have also had their protected status renewed.\nKirton Town Council has indicated it would like to acquire the sites, which are in the area near the B1400 where 350 homes were given planning permission earlier this month.\nRob Waltham, the leader of North Lincolnshire Council, said: \"While North Lincolnshire does need more homes - particularly for older people - these must be built in the right places and not at the expense of much-needed community assets.\"\nCommunity value status has also been given to the Kirton in Lindsey library and youth centre in King Edward Street.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) , and Instagram .

One in four schools are closed because it is too dangerous for children to risk going.\nSo severe is Burkina Faso's security crisis that some citizens welcomed the military coups two years ago, and hoped for an end to the violence and upheaval.\nYet the military junta has failed to deliver on its early promises to tackle Islamist militants, and the latter still control large swathes of the country.\nIt was during a summit in St Petersburg last year that President Vladimir Putin promised to send Burkina Faso a gift of thousands of tonnes of wheat.\nRussia is one of the world's biggest grain producers, and is projected to export about 45 millions tonnes of wheat this financial year , according to US estimates.\nThe isolated European power, condemned by much of the international community for waging war in Ukraine, is seeking to deepen alliances in Africa and elsewhere.\nSpeaking at a ceremony on Friday, Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Karamoko Jean Marie Traor\u00c3\u00a9 said the wheat consignment from Russia would help to push his nation towards \"developing our own production capacity in order to halt once and for all dependence on food from abroad\".\nNandy Some Diallo, Burkina Faso's minister for solidarity and humanitarian action, said the government was \"delighted\" and called the grain delivery a \"priceless gift\" that would benefit people who were internally displaced and vulnerable.\nEarlier this week, there were reports that a contingent of Russian troops had arrived in Burkina Faso.\nLast summer, Burkina Faso signed a deal with Russia in July for the construction of a nuclear power plant to increase its energy supply.

    "Greta Thunberg and four co-defendants have been found not guilty of breaking the law when they refused to follow police instructions to move on during a climate protest.\nDistrict Judge John Law threw out a public order charge due to \"no evidence\" of any offence being committed adding police attempted to impose \"unlawful\" conditions.\nThe 21-year-old was arrested at a climate change demonstration near the InterContinental Hotel in Mayfair on 17 October.\nThe judge said that the conditions imposed on protesters were \"so unclear that it is unlawful\".\nHe added that it meant that \"anyone failing to comply were actually committing no offence\".\n'Civilised'\n\"It is quite striking to me that there were no witness statements taken from anyone in the hotel, approximately 1,000 people, or from anyone trying to get in,\" he said.\n\"There was no evidence of any vehicles being impeded, no evidence of any interference with emergency services, or any risk to life.\"\nHe said that the protest was \"throughout peaceful, civilised and non-violent\" and criticised evidence provided by the prosecution about the location of where the demonstrators should be moved to, saying the only helpful footage he received was \"made by an abseiling protester\".\n'Law unclear'\nThe court heard that protesters started to gather near the hotel in October last year at around 07:30 and police engaged with them about improving access for members of the public, which the prosecution alleged had been made \"impossible\".\nThe judge rejected the submission as \"the main entrance was accessible (meaning) that the condition... was unnecessary when the defendants were arrested\".\nAnalysis\nBy Sean Dilley at Westminster Magistrates Court\nThe judge was scathing about the police's decision to impose unlawful restrictions on Greta Thunberg and other climate protesters.\nPut simply, he didn't see any need to interfere with the legitimate right of demonstrators to assemble to the extent they did.\nThe judge noted that the protest was peaceful and civilised. He said officers had ample opportunity to put less restrictive measures in place, such as using barriers to maintain access to the hotel.\nHe felt the tactics used breached the lawful rights of protesters on 17 October and he said that conditions were so restrictive as to be unlawful.\nHe was highly critical of communications between Supt Matt Cox and less senior officers.\nUltimately, Judge Law said that as the Section 14 restrictions were unlawful, none of the defendants were guilty of a crime.\nSpeaking after the hearing, Ms Thunberg's lawyer, Raj Chada, told reporters: \"The charges against them were rightly dismissed.\n\"The conditions imposed on the protest were unclear, uncertain and unlawful.\n\"They were unlawful because they disproportionately interfered with our client's right to free speech.\"\nHe said the government should \"stop prosecuting peaceful protestors\".\nHe added \"we will look into all options\" when asked whether civil action would be taken against those who prosecuted the case.\nMs Thunberg appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court after previously denying breaching the Public Order Act 1986.\nShe was accused of breaching section 14 of the act by blocking the entrance to the hotel.\nMs Thunberg appeared at court along with two Fossil Free London protesters and two Greenpeace activists, who also pleaded not guilty to the same offence.\nOil executives had been meeting inside for the Energy Intelligence Forum.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Every year, hundreds of North Korean defectors, who have since settled in the South, send much-needed money back home. But this is getting riskier as both countries are increasingly cracking down on illegal transfers of money.\n\"It is like a spy movie and people are putting their lives on the line,\" says Hwang Ji-sung, who has been a broker in South Korea for more than a decade.\nAs a defector himself, he knows how complex and difficult the task is - requiring a covert network of brokers and couriers spread across South Korea, China and North Korea.\nSecret calls using smuggled Chinese phones are made at remote locations. Code names are used.\nThe stakes are incredibly high - if caught, North Koreans risk being sent to the country's dreaded political prison camps, known as kwan-li-so, where hundreds of thousands are believed to have died over the years.\nA 2023 survey by the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights which polled about 400 North Korean defectors, found that around 63% had transferred money to their families in the North.\nBut since 2020, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has intensified a crackdown on brokers to stop the flow of money and \"reactionary ideology and culture\" from South Korea.\n\"The number of brokers in North Korea has gone down by more than 70% compared to a few years ago,\" says Joo Soo-yeon, Mr Hwang's wife. She is also a broker.\nSouth Korea bans such transfers too, but in the past authorities have mostly looked the other way. Now that is changing.\nLast April, Mr Hwang and Ms Joo's home in Gyeonggi province - which is close to Seoul - was raided by four police officers, who accused her of violating the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. Because the bank account that was used to send money to North Korea was in her name, she's the one facing charges.\nAt least seven other brokers are also under investigation.\nOn-camera interviews with brokers are rare, but Ms Joo has chosen to speak to the BBC partly because she wants to publicise her case. The police have not responded to a BBC inquiry over her case.\nSouth Korean authorities told Mr Hwang that any money transfer to North Korea should be carried out through a \"legitimate bank\".\n\"If there is one, let me know!\" he said, adding that there is no institution that can legally receive money in North Korea since the two Koreas are technically still at war.\nInter-Korean relations have been worsening since the North blew up a joint liaison office with the South in 2020. Earlier this month, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un even said it was no longer possible to achieve reunification with the South - a goal enshrined in the constitution.\nSecret calls\nThese illicit cross-border cash transfers begin with a phone call between defectors in the South and their families in the North - made possible by an influx of smuggled Chinese phones in border provinces which can tap into Chinese telecom networks.\nThe calls are facilitated by brokers in North Korea who have to travel long distances and sometimes even climb mountains to arrange such calls.\nAfter hours of waiting, the call is connected, and the defector will agree on a sum with families. But the conversation has to be brisk to avoid surveillance from the Ministry of State Security.\nThe defector then makes a deposit into a Chinese account through brokers in South Korea. This is also fraught with risk as China also closely monitors the flow of foreign currency.\nIt is up to the Chinese brokers to bring the money into North Korea.\nThe borders are relatively porous as China is North Korea's most important ally. Remittances from defectors are sometimes disguised as transactions between Chinese and North Korean trading companies.\nThey employ several couriers in North Korea to deliver the money to the families.\n\"The people delivering the money don't know each other, and they shouldn't because their lives are at stake,\" says Kim Jin Seok, who used to work as a courier in North Korea before he fled the country in 2013. We've given him a pseudonym for his safety.\nBrokers have to use aliases and develop codes to signal when it will be safe for families to receive funds.\nMr Hwang, who has about 800 clients, says he has even encountered families who rejected the money.\n\"They were scared that it could be a trap set up by the security police and would say things like, 'We won't accept money from traitors.'\"\nOnce the money is delivered, brokers will take about a 50% cut.\n\"North Korean brokers risk their lives to make 500,000 to 600,000 won per transfer,\" Mr Hwang says. At today's exchange rates, that's about $375-$450 (\u00c2\u00a3295-\u00c2\u00a3355).\n\"Nowadays, if you are arrested by a security officer and convicted, you would face 15 years in jail. If convicted of espionage, you would be sent to a kwan-li-so.\"\nMr Hwang shows us testimony from North Koreans who have received money through his brokers.\n\"I was starving every day and ate grass,\" cries an old woman in one of them, her hands swollen from scavenging for food in the woods.\n",
    "France's new prime minister has announced key concessions to protesting farmers in a move the government hopes will end the growing demonstrations.\nAmong promises Gabriel Attal made on Friday were an end to rising fuel costs and the simplification of regulations.\nIt came hours after farmers took their protest about pay and low food prices to Paris - blocking major roads into and out of the capital.\n\"You wanted to send a message, and I've received it loud and clear,\" he said.\n\"We will put agriculture above everything else,\" he promised during a visit to a cattle farm in a mountain village near the Spanish border.\nMr Attal tried to address the farmer's grievances, which include the increasing cost of farm diesel, late payment of European Union (EU) subsidies, burgeoning bureaucracy and competition from imports.\nHe announced \"10 immediate measures\" to help, including the scrapping of the plan that would increase the cost of fuel.\nMr Attal said that an appeal would be made to the EU, asking for changes to the rules that mean farmers are required to keep some of their land fallow.\nHe added that France would remain opposed to signing an EU free-trade deal that farmers say will flood supermarkets with cheap produce.\nHis concessions have not gone down well with some.\n\"We are not satisfied with what was announced this evening,\" Alexandre Plateau, a representative of the National Federation of Farmers' Unions (FNSEA), the main farmers' union, told the Franceinfo radio network.\n\"A few requests have been met, but it is not enough.\"\nLaurence Marandola, a spokesman for the Peasant Confederation union body, told the RTL radio network that Mr Attal's concessions were \"very largely insufficient\".\n\"We will continue to remain mobilised. It's not necessarily roadblocks, there will be different forms of mobilization, on the road, on roundabouts, in front of supermarkets,\" she said.\nEarlier on Friday, the A1 motorway linking Paris the northern city of Lille and Belgium was blocked by tractors and hay bales.\nAccording to the FNSEA, some 55,000 people were mobilised nationwide.\nAmong the protesters was Christophe Beeuwsaert, a cereal and milk farmer in the Oise region north of Paris. He told the AFP news agency that the plan was to build a ring around the city and to keep moving closer in - increasing the pressure.\n\"When we hear our governments saying that they understand us, that they know what we're going through, it's just a load of rubbish,\" he said.\nThey (the politicians) sit in their leather seats, in their heated or air-conditioned offices... don't see the impact of all the decisions they make on us.\"\nProtests are also continuing in the south of France, with the main road between the Lyon region and the Spanish border also blocked.\n\"We've already been demonstrating for a week and we still have no answers. We don't want any more words, we want acts,\" Sebastien, a young farmer, told AFP news agency at a blockade outside Toulouse's Blagnac airport.\nThe farmers' protests are the first major test for Mr Attal, who has only been in power since the start of the month.\nThey began in the south west of France last week, with several key motorways there cut off entirely by farmers who have installed sleeping quarters in the middle of the highways.\nOn Tuesday, a farmer in her 30s and her 12-year-old daughter were killed after a car accidentally crashed into a roadblock just south of Toulouse.

    "A British base jumper has died in Thailand, local police have said.\nThe 33-year-old man's parachute failed to open after he jumped from a building in the eastern beach resort of Pattaya, according to local authorities.\nOfficers said they were called to a 29-storey apartment block on Saturday evening after eyewitnesses reported seeing a person crash through a tree and fall to the ground.\nThe victim's social media pages suggest that he was an experienced parachutist.\nPolice said they found a blue parachute, which had not opened, on the man.\nStaff at the building said the man had got to the top floor with friends who were filming him base jumping.\nThe extreme sport - which involves jumping with a parachute from high landmarks, rather than an aircraft - has become increasingly popular among foreigners living in south east Asia.\nSome earn income from the number of social media followers watching their videos.\nHowever, with just a few seconds before hitting the ground, it is also a very dangerous activity, with little margin for error.\nIt has a much higher fatality rate than skydiving.

    "Sub-postmasters wrongfully prosecuted by the Post Office had their lives \"utterly destroyed\" by the scandal, lawyers acting for them have said.\nHundreds of people were convicted after faulty Horizon software flagged false discrepancies in accounts.\nAn ongoing public inquiry has been looking at how the court cases were brought against sub-postmasters.\nOne lawyer said this phase of the probe had \"pulled back the curtain\" on the scandal.\nThe fourth phase of the inquiry into the Horizon scandal drew to a close on Friday, having taken evidence from Post Office and Fujitsu employees over several months.\nIt looked at how investigations were conducted, and how information that the Post Office had which cast doubt on Horizon was not disclosed during court proceedings.\nThe next stages of the inquiry will see former Post Office boss Paula Vennells give evidence.\nLast month, Ms Vennells handed back her CBE after facing mounting pressure following the broadcast of the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office.\nPoliticians will also testify in phases five and six of the inquiry, including the former and current Liberal Democrat leaders Jo Swinson and Sir Ed Davey, Labour MP Pat McFadden and former conservative MP Margot James. All served for a time in various governments as the minister with responsibility for overseeing the Post Office.\nSumming up at the end of stage four, Tim Moloney KC, said 76 sub-postmasters had their convictions quashed \"only after having their lives utterly destroyed by the scandal at the heart of this inquiry\".\nSpeaking on behalf of Hudgell Solicitors, he said the firm represented many of the sub-postmasters whose stories were featured in ITV drama.\nIn the series, sub-postmistress Jo Hamilton is portrayed as being \"surrounded by paperwork, distraught and seeking assistance from a helpline\".\n\"The help offered was no help at all, doubling a discrepancy before her eyes,\" he said, adding this was \"real life for Jo\".\n\"Our clients' stories repeatedly echo that awful fear, and the impossible question of themselves and Horizon,\" Mr Moloney said.\n\"Time and again they asked for help,\" he said. \"For many, because none came, they stopped asking.\n\"Time and again their lives were ruined\" by prosecution, he added, despite their telling the Post Office about the discrepancies and maintaining their innocence.\nThis phase in the inquiry had been \"critically important in getting at the real truth for them, about what they went through\", he said.\nThe inquiry had shown that the Post Office approach to investigation and the recovery of losses, supported by Fujitsu, was \"deeply and fundamentally flawed\".\nHe said the management and oversight of investigations and prosecutions was \"wilfully blind\" or \"disregarding\" of  the \"proper, lawful administration of justice\".\nMr Moloney added the Post Office and Fujitsu, which supplied the software, were focused on their own commercial interests, including brand reputation, rather than on the interests of sub-postmasters.\nHe said that evidence given to the inquiry could now lay some of the witnesses open to \"rigorous criminal investigation\".\nSam Stein KC, representing the Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance (JFSA) and 157 individual sub-postmasters, said this phase of the inquiry had \"pulled back the curtain on the decades of the great Post Office cook-up and cover-up\".\nThe process wrecked the \"physical, mental and economic health\" of sub-postmasters, he said.\nHe said the inquiry had shown \"disdain and dislike of sub-postmasters by the Post Office and their employees\", underlined by a Post Office investigator saying sub-postmasters were \"all crooks\".\nMr Stein added that the latest phase of the inquiry had shown an \"appalling lack of professionalism of lawyers, combined with bullying investigators\", a refusal to investigate the Horizon system because of what that would reveal, and that Post Office employees felt the firm \"must be protected at all costs\".\nHe also criticised \"corporate amnesia\", referring to a number of witnesses who said they could not remember details of events.\nA Post Office spokesperson said: \"We fully support the aims of the ongoing public inquiry to get to the truth of what happened in the past, and it is vital that Post Office witnesses are able to provide evidence openly so that the inquiry can assess all the evidence.\"\nOn Thursday three more sub-postmaster convictions were overturned.

    "Chants of \"Wiwa, Wiwa, Wiwa\" - a reference to Ken Saro-Wiwa, the renowned writer and environmentalist executed by Nigeria's military regime in 1995 - rang out through a Zimbabwean courtroom this week.\nIt is the nickname of opposition politician Job Sikhala, who was sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence after a record 595 days in pre-trial detention.\nThe 52-year-old former MP and lawyer chose the moniker \"Wiwa\" whilst at university - and it has defined his political career.\n\"He admired the bravery of Ken Saro-Wiwa ,\" opposition MP Daniel Molokele told the BBC.\nHe went on to describe his close friend as \"loud, outspoken, assertive, confident, and someone who always stood up to authority\".\nMr Sikhala, who says he is driven by his desire to end injustice and tyranny in Zimbabwe, joined the Movement for Democratic Change  (MDC) in 1999.\nThe MDC was the first party to mount a real challenge to the ruling Zanu-PF party of Robert Mugabe, the leader who ruled the country from independence in 1980 until he was ousted by his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa, nicknamed the \"crocodile\" because of his political cunning, with the backing of the military in 2017.\nNow president, Mr Mnangagwa was one of those in the ruling party who lost his seat when the MDC contested its first election.\nMr Sikhala reckons that during his 25-years in the opposition he has been arrested more than 60 times - with his sentence on Tuesday his only conviction.\nThe fiery politician was last arrested in June 2022 for allegedly inciting public violence. His long detention before trial meant he was denied the opportunity of participating in last year's election.\nAfter Tuesday's ruling at the Harare Magistrates Court, he was told he would spend one more night in jail before his release from Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison - a message which quickly circulated on social media.\nInstead, the prison authorities ordered him to pack his stuff and leave immediately that evening.\n\"I was escorted to the gates and dumped by the roadside,\" Mr Sikhala told the BBC.\nHe had to call his lawyers to collect him.\nHe believes the authorities did not want the scenes of jubilation in court repeated outside the prison gates on Wednesday morning.\n\"The move was meant to wrongfoot those preparing to welcome me out of Chikurubi,\" he said.\nMr Sikhala's run-ins with authority predate the MDC, says Mr Molokele , who was a fellow student leader at the University of Zimbabwe in the 1990s.\nHe was not afraid to criticise how the Mugabe government was running the country and its efforts to control the university.\n\"He endeared himself to other students and held various positions in the Student Representative Council from his first year until he graduated,\" Mr Molokele says.\nAnother former student, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, remembers an incident when the university security took away Mr Sikhala's megaphone: \"That did not deter him. He told them the students would hear him without a megaphone.\"\nYounger students tended to look up to him and respect him as he had worked as a high school teacher before enrolling at the university to study economic history, Mr Molokele says.\nThis was not the end of his studies - years later when an opposition MP he returned to university and qualified as a lawyer.\n\"The persecution I suffered at the hands of the authorities pushed me to study law, I wanted to understand what they were arresting me for because the arrests seemed so spurious and arbitrary,\" he told the BBC.\nMr Sikhala's transition from campus to national politics was seamless.\nA month after he graduated in August 1999, the MDC was formed - and he used his oratory skills to win a seat in parliament the next year.\nThe violence that preceded the vote set the tone for subsequent elections in Zimbabwe, with members of the MDC subjected to harassment, arrests and beatings.\nBeing in parliament did not temper Mr Sikhala's appetite for showing the establishment his disdain.\nAccording to parliamentary etiquette, members are supposed to bow when walking past the Speaker's chair or on entering or exiting the chamber.\nMr Sikhala refused to honour Mr Mnangagwa, who was appointed Speaker after his humiliating defeat in 2000.\n\"I'd never [show] courtesy to that dictator,\" he told me, going on to explain that he holds Mr Mnangagwa responsible for the post-independence massacres known as Gukurahundi .\nMr Mnangagwa, who was national security minister at that time in the early 1980s, has denied any role in the killings of ethnic Ndebele in southern Matabeleland.\nNot long before Mr Mnangagwa took over the presidency in 2017, Mr Sikhala wrote him a long open letter saying: \"No matter how much you might try to downplay or trivialise your role in the massacre of innocent civilians in Matabeleland during Gukurahundi, we know for a fact that one of our own family members, who is my aunt, died because of your active participation and direct underground command.\"\nHe went on to blame Mr Mnangagwa for a",

    "Two birds of prey have scuppered plans that saw the Welsh government spend \u00c2\u00a34.25m on a farm to help the Green Man festival company.\nA restricted zone has been put in place on Gilestone Farm, Powys, to protect the nest of two ospreys - making the site unusable.\nMinisters say it is the first time the birds have been seen so far south in Wales in 200 years.\nThe company said it would look at other opportunities.\nIt is expected the ospreys, which were first seen at the site near Talybont-on-Usk last year and are protected by law, will return in the spring.\nOfficials are now considering selling the farm but the Welsh Conservatives said the purchase should never have happened in the first place.\nPlaid Cymru said it had been a \"fiasco\" from the start, while the news was welcomed by campaigners.\nMinisters bought the farm in 2022 with the intention of helping the company - since then Green Man has been in negotiations to lease the site.\nWhile their main festival would have remained at Glan Usk Park, Green Man wanted to use the location for other events while continuing to farm the area.\nThe project had the support of Powys council but proved controversial locally, and there were concerns at the prospect of events taking place for as many as 3,000 people in a rural area.\nQuestions were raised too by opposition parties about why the government bought the farm before Green Man had submitted a business plan.\nLater it emerged that Green Man had to rely on Welsh ministers to buy the farm as it was unable to source the funds itself .\nAn auditor said Welsh Labour ministers acted with \"avoidable haste\" when it made the purchase.\n'Surprised and delighted'\nIn a statement Economy Minister and leadership contender Vaughan Gething said the government was \"surprised and delighted\" to learn last August that a pair of ospreys had decided to nest on the Gilestone Farm site.\nOspreys are a schedule 1 species protected under law.\nAn expert adviser told the government last December that a \"750m [2,460ft] restricted zone around the nest must be in place on the farm within which only very limited human activity can take place\".\nMr Gething said it was clear \"that the full commercial and charitable objectives of the Green Man Group, as set out in its business plan for the use of Gilestone Farm, can no longer be realised\".\nThe economy minister said the government was committed to continuing to help Green Man \"secure a suitable long-term base in Wales\".\nMr Gething's written statement criticised the behaviour of some of those who were opposed to the plans, saying ministers do not \"change decisions based on threats issued by third parties\".\n\"It is equally disappointing that elected officials and business partners have been subject to sustained and personal attacks regarding this matter,\" he said, adding women had \"borne the brunt of personal and abusive criticism\".\nThe minister said there were still \"opportunities for sustainable farming and economic development\" at the site, and that ministers would extended the existing farm business tenancy.\n'Concerns raised early on'\nManaging director of Green Man, Fiona Stewart, said: \"While we are obviously disappointed that the project will not be going ahead at Gilestone Farm, we will now look at other opportunities.\n\"The team at Green Man extends its deepest gratitude to everyone who has supported the Gilestone Farm project.\"\nCampaigners against the plans were pleased by the news.\nThe Stop Gilestone Farm Project said: \"We have always been concerned that the environment and landscape is of paramount importance, and the appearance of two osprey has been testament to the exceptional habitat and wildlife in this area.\"\nThe group urged Mr Gething to investigate concerns of threats and personal attacks properly \"rather than making a generalised statement which risks misrepresenting the community in Talybont-on-Usk\".\n\"The Welsh government must accept there were legitimate local concerns about this scheme and these have always been carefully and respectfully presented by our campaign group.\"\nMost opposition parties were united in criticism of the entire Welsh government project.\nJames Evans, Welsh Conservative MS for Brecon and Radnorshire, said: \"The purchase of Gilestone Farm should never have happened in the first place\".\n\"Conservation concerns were raised early on in this process, as were concerns about the purchase of the farm itself, and now the Labour government finds itself holding an expensive asset for a purpose completely alien to their initial plan,\" he added.\nThe Conservative MP for the same constituency, Fay Jones, said it was an \"extraordinary waste of taxpayers' money\".\nCefin Campbell of Plaid Cymru added: \"This sorry tale has been a fiasco from the beginning - from questions over the purchase, to a lack of meaningful local engagement.\n\"What is most frustrating is that \u00c2\u00a34.25m could have made a real difference to rural development in mid Wales at a time when budgets are so tight.\"\nWelsh Liberal ",

She would have to face another new challenge much earlier than she anticipated.\n\"One of the biggest reality checks for me was going through the menopause experience before my mum,\" she said.\nNow 31, the fashion blogger from Crumlin, County Antrim, said people should feel free to speak out about a subject that too often went unspoken.\n\"Every woman is going to go through the menopause no matter what age it happens - it definitely needs to be spoken about a lot more,\" she said.\nThis was a reality Aisling had to face after she was told the radiotherapy to treat the cancer would affect her fertility.\nShe was given a four-week window to freeze her eggs, but due to a low egg count and risk of infection she decided not to proceed.\n\"For me it may have been another heartbreak down the line as the eggs might not have worked,\" she told BBC News NI.\nAs well as not being able to have biological children, the treatment also forced her into the menopause.\nWhat is the menopause?\nThe menopause is when a woman's periods stop due to lower hormone levels.\nIt can have an impact on a woman's physical and mental health.\nSymptoms can include anxiety, depression, brain fog and hot flushes.\nIt usually affects women between the ages of 45 and 55 but it can happen earlier.\nPremature menopause is when a woman's periods stop before the age of 45. This can happen naturally or, as in Aisling's case, as a side effect of some treatments like radiotherapy .\nAisling said her symptoms started with hot flushes - but because she was also going through cancer treatment it was hard to pinpoint the side effects.\n\"I had to wait until my cancer treatment was finished until I could go on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT),\" she said.\nHRT is a treatment used to help menopause symptoms. It replaces hormones that fall to low levels and can help treat symptoms such as anxiety and low moods.\nThree years on, Aisling said the situation was still something she had to navigate.\n\"The main reality of going through the menopause early is not having a family,\" she said.\n\"Some days you completely forget about it and it's irrelevant - then even thinking about dating or doing anything like that, I just freak out.\n\"I think I'm going to have to tell the person I'm dating straight away that I've been through the menopause.\"\nBut, she believes that more education for younger people about early menopause, and its possible causes, would make it easier for others to navigate.\n\"In general menopause, fertility, things like that - it's such a part of growing up,\" she said.\n\"Every woman is going to go through the menopause no matter what age it happens - it definitely needs to be spoken about a lot more.\n\"I think if everybody had a wee bit more education around it, there will be more awareness.\"\nIncreasing awareness\nThe Department of Education said young people had the opportunity to learn about menstruation in both primary and post-primary school but, due to the age profile of pupils, menopause may not currently be taught in schools.\nAisling's sentiments are something organisation The Daisy Network agrees with.\nIt is the only organisation in the UK dedicated to providing information and support to young women diagnosed with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency, also known as premature menopause.\nCorinna Bordoli, from the group, said infertility is something that could affect someone's mental health.\n\"In the past few years there is a lot of media noise about the menopause but there isn't a focus on younger women,\" she said.\n\"It's very different for someone who is so young. It is massively life-changing for their present but also their future.\n\"It's about educating people but it's also about doing the research and asking is there a better way to support younger women.\"\nAisling said that going through the menopause at a young age could be daunting and lonely even if you had a good circle around you.\nHer advice? Take things one day at a time.",
    "Chinese billionaire banker Bao Fan, who has been missing for almost a year, has resigned from all roles at his firm, China Renaissance Holdings.\nHe stepped down \"for health reasons and to spend more time on his family affairs,\" the bank said in a statement .\nMr Bao's unexplained disappearance in February last year shocked China's business and investing community.\nJust days later, China Renaissance said he was cooperating with authorities who were conducting an investigation.\nIn its latest filing, the company said co-founder, Xie Yi Jing, will assume Mr Bao's most senior roles.\nMr Bao \"has no disagreement with the Board and there is no other matter relating to his resignation that needs to be brought to the attention of the shareholders\", it added.\nHowever, it did not provide any details about Mr Bao's whereabouts.\nHe was one of China's most high-profile bankers with a client list that included technology giants Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu.\nIn February 2023, China Renaissance said: \"The board has become aware that Mr Bao is currently cooperating in an investigation being carried out by certain authorities in the People's Republic of China.\"\n\"The company will duly cooperate and assist with any lawful request from the relevant PRC authorities, if and when made,\" it added.\nThe announcement was the first time that China Renaissance had given a reason for the disappearance of its founder.\nHis disappearance came against the backdrop of a crackdown on leading technology companies by Chinese authorities.\nIn late 2020, Alibaba founder Jack Ma also disappeared from public view for three months , after making comments critical of market regulators. He had been due to publicly list his digital payments firm Ant Financial - which would have most likely made him the richest man in China.",

    "Landmarks across the UK have glowed purple to mark Holocaust Memorial Day.\nHolocaust Memorial Day is an occasion to remember the millions of mostly Jewish people murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators, as well as the victims of other genocides.\nThe date marks the anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp at Auschwitz on 27 January 1945.\nEach year, the commemorations are assigned a theme. In 2024, the theme is Fragility of Freedom.\nOrganisers say the theme encourages participants to not take freedoms for granted and consider what can be done to strengthen freedoms around the world.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak was among the UK leaders to pay tribute to those who lost their lives.\n\"We have a duty to remember the horrific crimes of the Holocaust,\" he wrote on Twitter, formerly X.\nScottish First Minister Humza Yousaf lit a candle in memory of those killed - saying the day had been a reminder that everyone must \"unite against hatred wherever we see it\".\nThe Royal Family also posted their commemoration to social media, uploading a photo of King Charles and Queen Camilla lighting candles recently at Sandringham House.\nIt was taken before the King went into hospital on Friday to undergo treatment for an enlarged prostate.\nReflecting on the theme of the day, King Charles said it was \"a stark reminder to us all how freedom can so easily be lost when it is taken for granted, and how crucial it is, therefore, to learn from those who bear witness to the horrors of the Holocaust and all genocides\".\nPeople across the UK have been encouraged to light candles in their own homes as a symbol of the fight against prejudice and hatred.\nApproximately six million Jewish people from countries across Europe were killed during the Holocaust.\nThe Nazis also killed millions of other people during World War Two, including Roma and Sinti, LGBT people, and people with disabilities.\nAs well as remembering the lives lost, Holocaust Memorial Day also commemorates the victims of genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur.",
    "Apple has attacked proposals for the UK government to pre-approve new security features introduced by tech firms.\nUnder the proposed amendments to existing laws, if the UK Home Office declined an update, it then could not be released in any other country, and the public would not be informed.\nThe government is seeking to update the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) 2016.\nThe Home Office said it supported privacy-focused tech but added that it also had to keep the country safe.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We have always been clear that we support technological innovation and private and secure communications technologies, including end-to-end encryption, but this cannot come at a cost to public safety.\"\nThe proposed changes will be debated in the House of Lords tomorrow.\nApple says it is an \"unprecedented overreach\" by the UK government.\n\"We're deeply concerned the proposed amendments to the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) now before Parliament place users' privacy and security at risk,\" said Apple in a statement.\n\"It's an unprecedented overreach by the government and, if enacted, the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers.\"\nThe Home Office told the BBC: \"It is critical that decisions about lawful access, which protect the country from child sexual abusers and terrorists, are taken by those who are democratically accountable and approved by Parliament.\"\nThe existing Act has been dubbed a \"snoopers charter\" by critics and this is not the first time Apple has lashed out against proposals to increase its scope.\nThe tech giant said in July 2023 it would consider pulling services such as Facetime and iMessage from the UK rather than compromise future security.\nBut the proposed UK law would go beyond just FaceTime and iMessage to encompass all Apple products.\nEarlier in January, civil liberties groups including Big Brother Watch, Liberty, Open Rights Group and Privacy International, put out a joint briefing opposing parts of the bill.\nThe groups said they were concerned the proposed changes would \"force technology companies, including those based overseas, to inform the government of any plans to improve security or privacy measures on their platforms so that the government can consider serving a notice to prevent such changes\".\nThey added this would be \"effectively transforming private companies into arms of the surveillance state and eroding the security of devices and the internet.\"\nThese proposed amendments follow a review of the existing legislation and include a range of updates around the collection of data by intelligence agencies and the use of internet connection records.",
    "The families of those who died in the Nottingham attacks have expressed their anger after triple killer Valdo Calocane was given a hospital order.\nBarnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, were fatally stabbed on 13 June along with Ian Coates, 65.\nTheir killer will be detained at a high-security hospital after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.\nMr Webber's mother said \"true justice has not been served\".\nUniversity of Nottingham students Mr Webber and Ms O'Malley-Kumar were fatally stabbed in Ilkeston Road just after 04:00 BST, while Mr Coates was found dead with knife injuries in Magdala Road after his van was stolen.\nPedestrians Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller were then driven at in Milton Street and Upper Parliament Street, in the city centre.\nThe 32-year-old, who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia before the attacks, also pleaded guilty to three counts of attempted murder.\nSpeaking outside Nottingham Crown Court following sentencing on Thursday, the victims' families voiced their anger at the outcome.\nEmma Webber, the mother of Mr Webber, said \"true justice has not been served today\", adding the families had been \"let down\" by police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\nShe accused Nottinghamshire Police's Assistant Chief Constable Rob Griffin of having \"blood on his hands\", following the force's failure to detain Calocane after an arrest warrant was issued in September 2022, over an assault on an officer.\nAnd she claimed the CPS had, in November, presented her family with \"a fait accompli that the decision had been made to accept manslaughter charges\".\n\"At no point during the previous five and a half months were we given any indication that this could conclude in anything other than murder,\" she said.\n\"We trusted in our system, foolishly as it turns out.\"\nIn response, a CPS spokesperson said it had met the families of Mr Webber and Ms O'Malley-Kumar online, and then again in person in December, with further offers to meet made \"throughout\".\nThey added: \"Engagement with those who have been left bereaved is one of our highest priorities and in all cases, we continue to liaise with victims' families throughout the legal process.\"\nJames Coates, son of Ian Coates, said his family had \"suffered a great loss\".\n\"The failures from the police, the courts and the health service have resulted in the murder of my father,\" he added.\nAnd Grace O'Malley-Kumar's father, Dr Sanjoy Kumar, said: \"We will never come to terms with the loss of our beloved daughter Grace, how she lost her life [and] her heroic actions .\"\nHe added: \"While we have never questioned this man's diagnosis, the lack of toxicology, contemporaneous mental health assessment, as well as missed opportunities to divert his lethal path, will forever play on our minds and this requires further review.\"\nOn Thursday, the CPS set out why it decided to accept a diminished responsibility plea rather than continue to push for Calocane to be jailed for murder.\nThe CPS said medical experts provided \"overwhelming\" evidence Calocane was suffering from a serious mental health condition, including hearing voices in his head telling him his family would be harmed unless he did what they told him to do.\nThree psychiatrists were asked to analyse Calocane's condition and all agreed it \"impaired his ability to exercise self-control\".\nThe CPS \"took the unusual step\" of asking a fourth expert to review those reports, and after they agreed with the findings, prosecutors concluded there was \"no realistic prospect of conviction for murder\".\nMr Justice Turner told Calocane he remained a danger and the sentence would \"result in you being detained in a high-security hospital, very probably for the rest of your life\".\n\"In the early hours of 13 June last year, you committed a series of atrocities in this city, which ended the lives of three innocent people,\" he said.\n\"Your sickening crimes both shocked the nation and wrecked the lives of your surviving victims and the families of them all.\"\nHe added the \"central issue\" was \"whether at the time of committing these offences, you were suffering from symptoms of severe mental disorder\".\nThe judge said, however, the psychiatric evidence did not detract from the \"horror\" and \"disastrous\" impact of the offences, but he said, in his view, Calocane's abnormality of mind \"significantly contributed\" to him perpetrating the attacks.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has sent his \"heartfelt condolences\" to the victims' families, but he declined to say whether he would order a public inquiry into the case.\nHe said: \"It was an absolutely awful case and as a parent, you think when you send your kids out into the world or university they'll be safe. I can't imagine the pain they are going through at the moment.\"\nMr Sunak said it was \"right\" Calocane would \"spend very probably the rest of his life\" in a high-security hospital.\nLawyers for Mr Birkett, one of the pedestrians who suffered",

    "More countries have halted funding to the largest UN agency operating in Gaza, as the crisis deepens over the alleged role of some staff in the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel.\nJapan and Austria said they were suspending payments to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\nThe US, UK, Germany and Italy are also among those who have suspended funding.\nUNRWA has told the BBC it is \"extremely desperate\" and that \"the humanitarian needs in Gaza are growing by the hour\".\nThe agency has sacked several of its staff over allegations they were involved on 7 October, when Hamas gunmen infiltrated Israel, killing about 1,300 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.\nMore than 26,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a major military operation in response, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says. Another 1.7 million people have fled their homes, with many of them sheltering at UNRWA facilities.\nAccording to a report in the New York Times, an Israeli intelligence dossier alleges that nearly 200 UNRWA workers are Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives, without providing detailed evidence.\nThe dossier also alleges that at least 12 workers crossed into Israel on 7 October. UNRWA has sacked nine of those employees and says it is investigating.\nAnother report published by the Wall Street Journal, also citing the Israeli intelligence dossier, alleges that about 1,200 of UNRWA's 12,000 employees in Gaza have links to Hamas or Islamic Jihad.\nOn Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to confirm the contents of the dossier, describing the agency as \"perforated with Hamas\".\n\"We discovered that there were 13 UNRWA workers who actually participated, either directly or indirectly, in the 7 October massacre,\" he said in an interview with UK channel TalkTV.\n\"In UNRWA schools, they've been teaching the doctrines of extermination for Israel - the doctrines of terrorism, glorifying terrorism, lauding terrorism.\"\nThe UN has declined to comment, saying an internal investigation into the agency is under way.\nBut earlier on Sunday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was \"horrified\" by the accusations relating to the 7 October attack. Despite that, he has appealed to donor countries to \"guarantee the continuity of UNRWA's operations\".\nIn a statement on Sunday, he said: \"Of the 12 people implicated, nine were immediately identified and terminated by the Commissioner-General of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini; one is confirmed dead and the identity of the two others is being clarified.\"\nHe said Gaza should not be penalised for the allegations.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the reports about UNRWA staff were \"deeply troubling\" and it was \"imperative\" for the organisation to investigate in order to hold people to account and review its procedures.\nBut he said that UNRWA played an \"absolutely indispensable role in trying to make sure that men, women and children who so desperately need assistance in Gaza actually get it\" and added it was therefore imperative that the organisation's role continues.\nEarlier on Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he had cancelled meetings with Mr Lazzarini and called on him to resign.\nAn UNRWA spokesperson said that if funding was not resumed, the agency would not be able to continue its operations beyond the end of February.\nAnnouncing its decision to suspend payment, Japan's foreign ministry said late on Sunday that it was \"extremely concerned about the alleged involvement of UNRWA staff members in the terror attack on Israel\".\nIt added that it had been \"strongly urging\" UNRWA to investigate the allegations \"in a prompt and complete manner\".\nJapan is the sixth-largest donor to the agency, according to UNRWA's 2022 figures.\nOn Monday, Austria said it was following suit, calling for \"a comprehensive, swift and complete investigation into the allegations\".\nJuliette Touma, the director of communications at UNRWA, said in a BBC interview that the allegations were \"extremely serious\" and that Mr Lazzarini had taken an \"extraordinary measure\" in immediately dismissing the staff members in question.\n\"We are extremely desperate. It has come at a time when the humanitarian needs in Gaza are growing by the hour,\" she said, adding that she had visited the territory herself last week.\n\"People continue to be displaced. People are hungry. The clock is ticking fast towards famine.\n\"We are doing everything possible to avert us from getting towards famine. But this lack of funding that we have been faced with now, when at least 10 of the largest donors have put a temporary pause on the funding, this is going to have very, very serious repercussions on what is, right now, the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza.\"\nShe said UNRWA had not seen the evidence, but the allegations were being investigated by the UN's oversight office in New York.",

    "Rail users in England are facing disruption because of strike action by members of train drivers' union Aslef.\nTrain companies are not using a new law allowing them to tell some staff to work so that a minimum level of services can run.\nWhich train routes are affected and when?\nSevere disruption is expected on strike days between Tuesday 30 January and Monday 5 February.\nDifferent operators are affected on different days, with some running no trains:\nThere will be no strike action on Sunday 4 February.\nHowever, Aslef members are also refusing to work overtime between Monday 29 January and Tuesday 6 February. This may cause some cancellations and delays.\nPassengers are advised to check before they travel. The latest information can be found on National Rail .\nSome of the affected train operators run services into Scotland and Wales.\nWhat is the new minimum service levels law?\nThe government passed a new law which means train companies can require enough staff to work on strike days to run 40% of services.\nCurrently, few or no services usually run when train drivers strike.\nThe Department for Transport said it expects employers to use minimum service levels \"if appropriate to do so, and to deliver the best possible service\".\nBut none of the operators affected have done so, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has described as \"disappointing\".\nThe rules are complicated to put in place, says BBC transport correspondent Katy Austin. One source told the BBC it means co-ordinating a reduced timetable with other operators in a short space of time.\nPlus, unions strongly oppose them.\nTrain operator LNER, which operates on the East Coast Mainline, reportedly planned to use the rules during a walk-out in February.\nIn response, Aslef called for five extra days of strikes, before both sides rowed back .\nAre there any rail strikes planned by other unions?\nIndustrial action by Aslef and the RMT union has meant huge disruption over the past couple of years.\nIn November last year, RMT members, including guards and ticket office staff, voted to accept a pay offer . This included a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022-23 as well as job security guarantees.\nTheir acceptance means they will no longer be involved in industrial action until at least the spring.\nHowever, talks with the RMT over future pay deals and working practices will continue.\nUnions in disputes need to reballot members every six months to see if they want to continue with industrial action.\nCurrently, unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action.\nCan I get my money back for strike days?\nRail passengers with advance tickets can be refunded fee-free if the train they are booked on is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled.\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00e2\u0080\u00af\nIf passengers have a return ticket they may also be entitled to a fee-free refund if any part of the journey is cancelled due to strikes.\nSeason ticket holders (flexi, monthly or longer) who cannot travel, can claim 100% compensation for strike dates through the Delay Repay scheme.\nWhat is the strike about?\nAslef is seeking better pay for its members.\nHowever, train operators say ways of working need to change for wages to rise, because of financial challenges and fairness to taxpayers.\nAslef says drivers are being asked to sacrifice working conditions in exchange for a below-inflation wage increase.\nIn April 2023, Aslef's executive committee rejected 4% pay rises for two years in a row. This was on condition that they would accept industry-wide changes to driver training, and negotiate changes to work patterns at individual operators.\nThere have been no formal talks since.\nThe government controls how much money is on the table and has the final say over what is offered. Ministers and industry negotiators have urged the union to give members a vote.\nHow much are rail workers paid?\nThe average salary of rail workers in 2022 was \u00c2\u00a345,919, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nIf drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is \u00c2\u00a339,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff.\nThe ONS says median pay for \"train and tram drivers\" is just under \u00c2\u00a359,000.\nTrain companies and the government say the offer rejected by Aslef would take average train driver pay to \u00c2\u00a365,000.\nWill you be affected by the strikes?

    "Nearly 12,000 unmarried parents whose partners have died risk missing out on an estimated \u00c2\u00a3175m of benefit payments, according to figures seen by the BBC.\nIf a couple with children are married or in a civil partnership and one of them dies, the surviving parent is entitled to bereavement support.\nLast year, UK law changed to afford cohabiting couples the same right.\nThey can make backdated claims worth thousands of pounds going back years, but must do so by Thursday, 8 February.\nFollowing a Freedom of Information request, BBC Radio 4's Money Box discovered that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) estimates about 17,000 widowed parents are eligible for bereavement support payments.\nBut only about 5,000 people have applied so far, leaving an estimated \u00c2\u00a3175m waiting to be claimed.\nTo qualify, you had to have children under the age of 18 living with you on 30 August 2018 - the date on which the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Siobhan McLaughlin that it was against human rights law to deny such payments to unmarried parents.\nYou can check if you are eligible here.\n'We weren't treated like we were a family'\nJanet Cowden lost her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 Paul Shoesmith in a motorbike crash during the Isle of Man TT races in 2016.\nBecause they were only engaged at the time and not married, she did not qualify for any widowed support to help raise their two young children, Jenson and Hudson, then aged two and three.\n\"It puts questions and a lot of doubt in your head, and you kind of felt, 'what actually am I to him?'. But we lived like man and wife. The only thing we didn't have was a piece of paper that said we were man and wife,\" she says.\n\"We were made to feel like we weren't a family, like we weren't a family unit and all that we had prior to his death didn't really exist.\"\nWhen the law changed, Janet became eligible for this benefit and received a back payment lump sum of several thousand pounds, as well as support of hundreds of pounds per month until her and Paul's children turn 18.\n\"It's huge,\" she says. \"I never thought I'd be in this position where I'd lost Paul and we wouldn't have had that security blanket if you like, so it's been huge.\n\"For me though the biggest win was [over] the injustice of it all and feeling like a system, like laws made us feel like we weren't a family and I don't think anybody should be made to feel like that.\"\nDifferent types of support\nThere are two types of benefit which widowed parents can claim for, depending on when their partner died.\nIf it happened before April 2017 the payments were known as Widowed Parent's Allowance.\nIf it was after that date the benefit changed to Bereaved Support Payment.\nThe amount of financial support available depends on individual circumstances, but Alison Penny, director at the Childhood Bereavement Network, says it is likely to be many thousands of pounds.\n\"Some of the amounts people have received under these back payments really are life-changing. There's a real symbolic importance to these payments as well. It's also about the recognition that these children - their grief matters just as much as anyone else.\"\nA spokesperson for the DWP told Money Box: \"To lose a loved one is devastating, and we are helping as many eligible parents as possible to benefit from these backdated payments before 8 February 2024.\n\"We have alerted bereaved parents to this support through stakeholders, charities and targeted media and social media campaigns, and encourage anyone who thinks they are eligible to visit gov.uk and make a claim by the deadline.\"\nYou can hear more on this story on Money Box shortly after broadcast.\nFollow Money Box and Dan on X (formerly known at Twitter)",
    "This time, the government are really going to do it. There is no going back. They are going to push the button on a new type of trade border coming into Britain from the continent.\nIn industry, it's being called Brexit 2.0. At least, that is the more polite version of the name for the imposition of a series of new post-Brexit requirements in Britain for food importers.\nIt is the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle of the changes necessary after the UK's exit from the EU's customs union and single market.\nThe most high-profile changes for food and plant product imports from the European Union start to be phased in on Wednesday, after a series of delays.\nThis will mean significantly extra red tape. In particular, an expensive veterinary certificate will be legally required with consignments of fresh food and plant imports from the EU. These are a requirement from 00:01 GMT on Wednesday, but will not be subject to actual checks at the border for another three months.\nThe government acknowledges that the extra red tape and checks will increase food prices, pushing up the overall level of prices by 0.2 percentage points over three years.\nThat means a notable impact on food inflation, but not a new food price shock of the kind seen after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That increase was, nonetheless, sufficient for the cabinet to further delay the imposition of the checks last year, at a time when food inflation was rising at double-digit rates.\nAs Tom Southall, a director of the Cold Chain Federation, puts it: \"There's never been a good time to do it, which is why it's been delayed five times.\"\nThe delays have led to two issues. There has been a lack of reciprocity. UK food and farm exports to the EU have required extra red tape, checks and delays for three years, but their competitors on the continent have enjoyed unfettered access to the UK. The farming industry has expressed concern for UK biosecurity, i.e. defending against the spread of plant and animal diseases, that could prove very costly.\nBut on Wednesday, four years on from Brexit day, the changes will start.\nIf things go according to the government's plan, the smooth and phased introduction of these new checks will protect UK biosecurity, have minimal impact on food availability and cost, and even provide an incentive for both the UK and EU to work together to lower these barriers.\nVarious parts of the industry report a range of interrelated concerns painting a rather different picture: of rising costs, delays, and limited availability - especially of specialist food imports.\nThe specific question is whether a lack of knowledge of the British changes in individual EU nations and regions will combine with a shortages of vets, and lead to many smaller EU businesses giving up on supplying the UK.\nThe impact is most likely to be seen on deli counters rather than supermarket shelves. John Keefe, director at Getlink, operators of the Channel Tunnel, says: \"The big unknowns are whether there are enough official vets across Europe to sign all the export health certificates. If there's not enough vets there will be a big problem as no certificate means no import.\"\nMost of the detractors fear that the changes will be a costly and problematic irritant to certain specialist suppliers, rather than a wider problem.\nThe introduction of these checks since December 2020 in the other direction (into the EU from Britain) has led to the need for 852,165 export health certificates issued by British vets, or 1.7 million hours of veterinary time, billed at \u00c2\u00a3100 per hour. That is according to the Chilled Food Association, which has to extract the numbers from the government through a monthly freedom of information request. It told the government that the industry already had to generate \u00c2\u00a38.5bn in extra sales to cover the \u00c2\u00a3170m cost of GB-to-EU veterinary certification.\nThe UK imports more food than it exports, so expect these numbers to be exceeded with these new requirements.\nKarin Goodburn of the Chilled Food Association also chairs the SPS Certification Working Group. Her big fear is that 24/7, 365-days-a-week food supply chains simply do not work when you have to wait for vets to sign off certificates and then give 24 hours notice of imports. \"It could stop those supply chains, or at least press the pause button,\" she says.\nLast week, she wrote to Agriculture Secretary Steve Barclay about wide-ranging concerns about the preparedness of the site in Kent that is meant to host the checks on cross-Channel imports.\nThere is amazement that the government has not yet set the charge for every consignment to pay for these checks. Clarity on whether the charge will be closer to \u00c2\u00a310 or \u00c2\u00a343 per consignment will come in the next few weeks, the government says.\nAbove all, EU official vets are unlikely to be available through the day, night and weekend to sign off perishable exports to the UK. And all of this is made more complex by the requirement to give one day's pre-notification of",

    "Parents of children who may have died due to online harm have won their battle for tougher powers to investigate tech companies.\nCoroners will be able to demand data from firms when holding an inquest into the circumstances of a child's death.\nThe announcement comes after the BBC revealed campaigners were accusing ministers of \"watering down\" initial promises about the new powers.\nBereaved families welcomed the government's decision to change course.\nThey said it would mean other parents would not face the \"agonising experience of being stonewalled by tech companies\".\nCampaigners have been pushing for new powers to get information from companies after the difficulties the coroner faced dealing with social media firms in the case of Molly Russell.\nThe 14-year-old ended her life in November 2017 after viewing suicide and self-harm content online.\nThe coroner concluded that the schoolgirl died while suffering from the \"negative effects of online content\".\nThe government had initially announced plans in June to give coroners new powers to access information held by tech companies, where there is a reasonable suspicion that social media, gaming or other parts of the online world was relevant to their deaths.\nBut it emerged in December that under the Data Bill, currently being debated in parliament, this provision was being narrowed to only apply to children who have taken their own lives, and not children who have died in other ways with social media potentially involved.\nThis change was opposed by the Bereaved Families for Online Safety, a campaign group which includes Lorin LaFave, whose 14-year-old son Breck Bednar was murdered in 2014 by a boy he had met through online gaming; and Stuart Stephens, whose 13-year-old son Olly Stephens was murdered by two boys in 2021, with social media at the heart of the case.\nAfter a series of meetings with the campaigners, the government has changed course.\nScience Secretary Michelle Donelan told the BBC: \"This important change will give bereaved parents access to critical digital information at a tragic time.\n\"Although nothing can take away the pain endured by the families, I hope this amendment goes some way to give more answers to anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves in similar heart-breaking situations.\"\nA source close to Ms Donelan said: \"She hopes that it can give the families some comfort to know that their campaigning has made a real difference.\"\nIn a statement, Bereaved Families for Online Safety said: \"We are pleased the government will honour its promise to us.\n\"As a group of families with our own individual stories, we are reassured that future bereaved families will not have to share in our agonising experience of being stonewalled by tech companies.\"\nBaroness Kidron, a crossbench peer who campaigns for more protections for young people online, said she was \"delighted\" the government had changed course.\n\"The transparency this measure will bring forward will lift a veil on the role of tech companies in cases where children die.

    "The Port of Dover and ferry companies have warned of \"serious and lasting negative impacts\" if the EU's new border IT system is implemented this autumn.\nIt said if the current plans go ahead \"communities, businesses and authorities\" would suffer.\nUnder the delayed Entry Exit System, people entering the EU will have to register fingerprints, a photo and passport details.\nLong queues have also been predicted.\nJuxtaposed border controls mean French border police check passports as people leave the UK to cross the Channel from Dover, London St Pancras and Folkestone.\nThere have been warnings for more than a year that this could cause very long queues, because of the extra time registration will take .\nIn joint written evidence to the European Scrutiny Committee, the Port of Dover, DFDS, Irish Ferries, and P&O Ferries said there was an \"existential risk facing critical supply chains, businesses, communities, and the tourism economy of nations on both sides of the Channel from the current lack of appropriate regime for the introduction of the EU Entry Exit System (EES)\".\nThey said there would be a \"severe\" impact on Dover's ferry business because the system \"would not be capable of processing current car and coaches volumes\".\nEvidence from a range of affected businesses, business groups and councils was published by the committee on Thursday.\nKent and Ashford councils both cautioned that queues for tourists had been \"quoted as a reasonable worst case of up to 14 hours\". They did not give a source for that assessment.\nAshford Borough Council's written evidence said \"such queues will create welfare concerns for passengers as well as having a significant effect on the local communities, specifically the towns of Dover, Folkestone and Ashford\".\nTourism organisation Visit Kent told the committee it was concerned the EES would disrupt the local economy.\nEurostar - which has previously warned of the issues EES could pose - also said implementing it would be a \"unique challenge\", adding the system was designed for airports rather than constrained city centre terminals.\nGetlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel, said the EES would add five to seven minutes to the overall journey time of passengers using the it.\nChair of the European Scrutiny Committee, Sir William Cash, said the evidence put forward \"paints an alarming picture of the possible risks surrounding the Entry-Exit System's implementation.\n\"Clearly, this policy could have a very serious impact, not only for tourists and travel operators but also for local businesses,\" he said.\n\"I implore decision makers on both sides of the Channel to take note of this evidence. The scheme is due to be implemented in October this year; the clock is ticking, and these issues must be urgently addressed\", Mr Cash added.\nThe boss of Dover has previously told the BBC the government should press for a solution where registration could be completed away from the port.\nA spokesperson for the prime minister said there were \"tried and tested contingency plans in place\" and that it was working \"closely with the French and all the port authorities to ensure that travellers and passengers do not experience any unnecessary delays\".",
    "The Bank of England has held interest rates at 5.25% but indicated it is edging towards cutting borrowing costs.\nAt its latest meeting, the Bank said it had discussed cutting rates, with inflation - the pace of price rises - set to fall quickly this year.\nBut the Bank's governor said it would wait for firm evidence that inflation was under control before doing so.\nFor the first time since the 2020 Covid pandemic, one Bank policymaker voted for an immediate cut.\nHowever, while Swati Dhingra voted to cut rates to 5%, two members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) backed an increase to 5.5%. The remaining six members voted to keep rates unchanged.\nIt is the first time there has been a three-way split on whether rates should rise, fall or be held since the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe Bank has been raising rates steadily over the past couple of years to try to reduce inflation, with the last rate rise in August last year.\nHigher interest rates cool inflation by making borrowing more expensive, discouraging people and businesses from taking on debt to fund spending.\nInflation has fallen sharply from a 40-year peak in October 2022 and currently stands at 4%.\nThe Bank is charged with keeping price growth at, or close to, a target of 2%.\nIt said in its latest inflation report that the figure would fall back to that target between April and June this year - quicker than it had previously expected.\n\"We have had good news on inflation over the past few months,\" Bank governor Andrew Bailey said, telling the BBC that he is \"optimistic\" that it is heading in the right direction.\nThe Bank's latest release also dropped the phrase it has used previously about a \"further tightening in monetary policy\", which is being seen as a sign that no more rate rises are expected.\nBut while the Bank is now suggesting that rates have peaked, Mr Bailey signalled that any cut in interest rates may still be some months away.\n\"We need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the 2% target, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates,\" he said.\nThe Bank is expecting a slight rebound in inflation over the summer, and at the Bank's news conference Mr Bailey said this was \"not an acceptable state of affairs\".\nThis suggests that any rate cut may not come as quickly as many expect.\nThe Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \"It's obviously very positive news for families with mortgages that interest rates appear to have peaked, but we should remember that inflation never falls in a straight line.\"\nThere is concern among some economists that the fall in the inflation rate towards the Bank's target is \"artificial\", due to the cut in the energy price cap, and that inflation will rebound somewhat over the summer as global energy prices have picked up.\nIn addition, growth in pay remains strong, with the Bank's survey of hundreds of companies pointing to a 5.4% rise in wage settlements this year.\nDr Dhingra, the economist who voted for a cut, pointed to risks from geopolitics, and the fact it takes a long time for rate decisions to affect the economy.\nThe Bank's new forecasts indicate that keeping rates at their current level could push a barely growing economy into an outright recession.\nPaul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that the Bank \"sent some soft signals that the next [interest rate] move will be a cut, but it pushed back more strongly against the idea that rates will be cut soon or far\".\nHowever, Mr Dales said he expected a faster fall in inflation and predicted the Bank would \"change its tune in the coming months\".\n\"A rate cut in June is still possible and we think rates will end 2025 at 3%,\" he added.\nYael\u00e2\u0080\u00afSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said she thought the Bank would be wary of keeping rates too high for too long, \"particularly with the impact of previous rate hikes yet to feed through to the economy\".\n\"However, we expect the Bank to pause for some time yet before beginning to cut interest rates,\" she said. \"Cuts could happen from the summer onwards.\"",
    "A Sufi shrine frequented by Indians of all faiths made headlines recently after a top political leader said that he wanted to \"liberate\" it for just Hindus. The BBC's Cherylann Mollan visited to understand what the controversy was about.\nThe ascent is no easy feat, with some 1,500 rock-cut steps separating the devout from their destination: a Sufi saint's tomb that has become a seat of faith, legend and disputed history.\nThe Haji Malang dargah (shrine), sitting on a hill on the outskirts of Mumbai in the western state of Maharashtra, is said to house the tomb of an Arab missionary who came to India more than 700 years ago. Like many other Sufi shrines across India, the dargah is seen as a symbol of assimilation and tolerance, despite being at the centre of a religious dispute.\nWhen I visited, both Hindus and Muslims were offering flowers and a chadar - a piece of cloth offered as a symbol of respect in Sufi traditions - at the saint's tomb. The belief is that any wish asked for with a \"pure heart\" will be granted.\nThe shrine's managing board mirrors this sense of respectful co-existence - while two of its trustees are Muslims, its hereditary custodians are from a Hindu Brahmin family.\nBut earlier this month, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde stirred controversy by reviving a decades-old claim at a political rally. He asserted that the structure, traditionally considered a dargah, was a temple belonging to Hindus, and declared his commitment to \"liberating\" it.\nMr Shinde did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.\nHis claim comes at a time when some prominent mosques and Muslim-made monuments in India are mired in disputes over claims that they were constructed by demolishing Hindu temples centuries ago.\nIn the 1980s, Mr Shinde's political mentor, Anand Dighe, spearheaded a campaign to \"reclaim\" the Haji Malang dargah for Hindus. In 1996, he reportedly led 20,000 workers from the Shiv Sena party inside the dargah to perform a pooja (a Hindu act of worship).\nSince then, Hindu hardliners, who refer to the structure as Malanggad, have continued the practice of performing pooja at the shrine on full Moon days, occasionally leading to clashes with Muslim devotees and locals.\nBut political observers say that Mr Shinde's stance may have less to do with faith and more to do with optics. Dighe's campaign had bumped up his appeal among Hindu voters in Maharashtra state.\n\"Mr Shinde is now trying to position himself as the 'Hindu saviour' of Maharashtra,\" says Prashant Dixit, a former journalist.\nSeparate from the national election, Maharashtra - India's wealthiest state - will vote for the state assembly later this year. Securing support from the Hindu majority is crucial for Mr Shinde, given the state's distinctive political landscape, says Mr Dixit.\nElections in Maharashtra are usually a four-way contest between the nativist, Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the centrist Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, each with their own share of core voters.\nBut Mr Shinde faces an additional complication - in 2022, he and his supporters defected from the erstwhile Shiv Sena.\nThe rebellion toppled the then-triparty government - an unlikely coalition of the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP - and forged a new alliance with the BJP to form the new government.\n\"But while lawmakers might change parties, it's hard to get core voters to switch loyalties,\" Mr Dixit says. \"By raising the dargah issue, Mr Shinde is hoping to appeal to the emotions of the core voters of the erstwhile Shiv Sena and consolidate the Hindu vote bank,\" he says.\nHindu devotees the BBC spoke to had mixed reactions to Mr Shinde's comments.\nKushal Misl, for instance, sees Mr Shinde as articulating what has long been on his mind - a belief that the shrine originally belonged to a Hindu saint and was later taken over by Muslims during invasions in India.\nRajendra Gaikwad shares a similar view but says that he feels uneasy about the ongoing debate. \"Whatever is happening in India right now is very bad,\" he says, and underscores his belief that for him, \"all gods are one\".\nAbhijit Nagare, who goes to the shrine every month, says that it doesn't matter to him which religion the structure belongs to - he likes to visit because he feels at peace there.\nNasir Khan, one of the shrine's trustees, told the BBC that the controversy had led to a dip in the number of devotees visiting the shrine. \"People come with their families and don't want to be hassled by miscreants,\" he said.\nThe controversy is also hurting local businesses.\nThe structure sitting atop the 3,000ft (914m) hill doesn't stand alone. The elevation is punctuated with houses, shops, and restaurants carved into the stone and rock over the years.\nMr Khan says that about 4,000 people, both Hindus and Muslims, live there. The locals depend on tourism to make a living, but it's a tough existence.\nLocals told the BBC that they struggle to get basic amenities like potab",
    "The Kenyan High Court has blocked the government from deploying police officers to fight gangs in Haiti.\nThe judge argued that the deployment would be illegal as the National Security Council lacks the legal authority to send police outside Kenya.\nHe added that the council can only deploy military, not police, for peacekeeping missions such as Haiti.\nLast year, Kenya had volunteered to lead a multinational security force in Haiti to quell gang violence.\nThe judge further explained that Kenyan law only allows the government to deploy police officers to another country if a reciprocal agreement exists between Kenya and the host nation.\nKenya's government has said it will appeal against the ruling.\nHaitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry last year asked the UN to urgently deploy a multinational force.\nHe said his government had been overwhelmed by gangs who controlled 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince.\nThe UN Security Council backed Kenya's offer to lead the force and Kenyan lawmakers went on to approve the deployment.\nIn Haiti, the possible deployment had received mixed reactions from community members who have suffered at the hands of gangs.\nLaurent Uwumuremyi, the country director of Mercy Corps, told the BBC the mission had the potential to facilitate access to public infrastructure and address the humanitarian crisis.\nHe added though that some community members said Haiti did not need external interventions and that they saw it as a waste of money and time.\nEkuru Aukot, the Kenyan opposition leader who brought the case, said the court ruling was a win for the country, which could not afford to spare officers before tackling its own security challenges.\nMr Aukot added that President William Ruto was only using the deployment to prop up his international image and seek favour with Western countries like the US.\nPresident Ruto said Kenya had an \"impressive record\" of participating in peace support missions around the world.\nHe added that the deployment would enable officers to improve and sharpen their skills and experience in providing security.\nHowever, the suitability of Kenyan police for the deployment had raised concerns over possible human rights violations.\nNicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC they had documented Kenyan police violence, including murders, going back to 2013.\nShe added that there has been a long history of international armed intervention in Haiti really doing \"a lot of terrible things\".\nThe Kenyan government has denied any allegations of human rights violations by its officers.\nOne police officer who had already received two months of intensive training said he was \"demoralised\" by the ruling.\n\"I was prepared to go.

    "The deaths of three American soldiers - two women and a man from the US state of Georgia - in a drone attack in Jordan on Sunday was exactly what the Biden administration was dreading.\nAnd it means the White House is taking an extremely difficult decision over how to respond.\nPresident Biden, who met his national security team in the Situation Room on Monday, says he has decided what to do after currently weighing the options before him. He could choose to strike Iran-allied targets in the region, hit Iran itself, or do nothing at all.\nAll options come with serious risk, especially in an election year where the president has to balance looking strong with ensuring an already dangerous situation does not spin out of control.\n\"We don't want a wider war with Iran,\" National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby told reporters. \"We don't want a wider war in the region, but we've got to do what we have to do.\"\nThe Biden administration also has to consider its response to Iran in the context of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.\nSince 7 October, the US's main priority has been to stop the conflict in Gaza from spreading in the region. That's what governed the carefully calibrated American responses to the previous non-fatal attacks on its forces in region.\nThis deadly attack completely changes the equation - the US now feels like it has no choice but to respond forcefully. Yet the need to strike a delicate balance remains.\nSo President Biden needs to find a course of action that sends a much more robust message of deterrence, without causing the very escalation they've been working so hard to avoid.\nMr Biden's political rivals - by virtue of being out of power - face no such dilemma.\nDonald Trump, the clear frontrunner in the race to pick a Republican presidential candidate, set the tone with a Sunday night post on social media that laid the blame squarely on the president.\n\"This brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic consequence of Joe Biden's weakness and surrender,\" Mr Trump wrote.\nThe former president did not say, however, how he would respond if he was in office and he has not commented further. Other Republicans have not held back.\nSenator Tom Cotton said \"the only answer to these attacks must be devastating military retaliation\". Anything less, he added, would confirm the president was a \"coward\".\nThe leading Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, called for \"serious, crippling cost to Iran\". Senator Lindsay Graham said the US should \"strike targets of significance inside Iran\".\nBut leading Democrats did not go as far - most called for those responsible to be held accountable and for the US to target Iran-backed groups rather than the country itself.\n\"This attack\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 cannot go unanswered,\" Senator Ben Cardin, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said. \"I support President Biden in a deliberate and proportionate response.\"\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal used similar language, writing on X that \"a strong, surgical response is vital against Iran-backed forces\".\nThe Biden administration has said its decision on how to respond will not be based on polls or the looming election. \"He's not looking at political calculations,\" John Kirby told reporters.\nBut in an election year, any foreign policy decision is inevitably influenced by domestic politics. How will military action - or inaction - be perceived by American voters?\nIt is often assumed that foreign policy plays a minor part on the decisions voters make about who they want as their president. But with conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, polls suggest it is important for more voters this year.\nThe details of this particular attack may well have faded by November when Americans go to the polls - but people do care about the image they think their nation projects in the world.\nI've heard voters across America tell me they are concerned that the US looks weak these days. They like Donald Trump's promise of strong-man-leadership that will mean no other country would dare to try push America around.\nObviously it is much easier to talk about military strategy and global diplomacy on the campaign trail than it is inside the White House situation room.\nJoe Biden, meanwhile, is faced with a delicate and dangerous decision that could have far-reaching consequences in the Middle East. But his response could also have repercussions closer to home in what is a high-stakes election year.",

    "There is a \"considerable and immediate flood risk\" to thousands of homes in a coastal area of Hampshire, a council partnership has said.\nCoastal Partners has submitted plans to secure a 1.25km stretch on the north side of Portsea Island, which will be reviewed by Portsmouth City Council's planning committee.\nThe proposal would see the raising and replacing of existing defences.\nIt aims to protect 4,200 residential properties for the next 100 years.\nThe area, between Portsea Creek Roundabout and the viaduct, also has 490 commercial properties, two access roads, a railway route, landfill sites and 89 electrical substations, which are all at risk of flooding.\nPlanning documents state: \"Due to the low-lying nature of the land, condition of the existing coastal defences and the predicted effects of climate change, there is considerable and immediate flood risk to the North Portsea Island area.\n\"The scheme, as set out in the submitted plans and documents, minimises the impact on both the natural and historic environment, proposing significant mitigation against harm through the design, construction and operational stages.\n\"Where possible, it also takes the opportunities to enhance and improve the character and quality of the coastal area and the way it functions, as well as specific enhancements for ecology, biodiversity and the experience of footpath users.\"\nThe defences have an embankment-based design using two different types of \"rock and earth revetment/embankment\".\nThe latter would create a new coastal path for walking and cycling, it added.\nPlanning officers have recommended approving the scheme, which they describe as an \"essential piece of infrastructure for the city\", which would contribute to economic growth.\nThe project, which will be discussed by Portsmouth City Council's planning committee on 31 January , is expected to be funded by Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Grant in Aid (FCERM-GiA).\nAdditional reporting by Sue Paz, BBC News.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "Japan's Moon lander ended up on its nose when it made its historic touchdown on the lunar surface.\nThe first picture of the stricken Slim spacecraft shows it rotated 90 degrees from how it should have come to rest.\nThis will go some way to explaining the difficulties it has had in generating the electricity needed to operate.\nThe image was captured by the small baseball-sized robot called Sora-Q that was ejected from Slim moments before touchdown last Saturday.\n\"An abnormality in the main engine affected the landing attitude of the spacecraft,\" the Japanese space agency Jaxa said in a statement.\nIt seems one of the two big thrusters on Slim (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) stopped working during the descent.\nTo get the picture to Earth, Sora-Q first had to transmit it to a second ejected roving robot, Lunar Excursion Vehicle 1, or Lev-1. This hopping robot has radio equipment that can contact mission control independently of Slim.\nThe lander itself was shut down three hours after arrival because it could not get its solar cells to work. With the battery rapidly draining, Jaxa officials took the decision to hibernate Slim.\nTheir assumption - which seems to be borne out by the Sora-Q image - is that the main spacecraft is orientated in a way that prevents the solar cells from seeing the Sun.\nThe hope is to wake Slim when lighting angles change at its landing location.\nBefore hibernation, controllers were able to pull down a series of pictures of the surface taken by its on-board infrared camera.\nThese show the spacecraft to be on a slope, surrounded by small rocks.\nSlim's landing location is at the edge of an equatorial crater known as Shioli.\nThe landing on Saturday at 00:20, Japan standard time (15:20 GMT, Friday), made Jaxa only the fifth national space agency to achieve a soft touchdown on the Moon - after the US, the former Soviet Union, China and India.\nStatistically, it's proved very hard to put down softly on the lunar surface. Only about a half of all attempts have succeeded.\nJaxa put its faith in new precision-navigation technologies.\nThe lander's onboard computer used rapid image processing and crater mapping to avoid hazards to reach its touchdown point.\nEngineers had wanted to get within 100m (330ft) of their targeted location. This was achieved.\n\"Analysis of the data acquired before shutting down the power confirmed that Slim had reached the Moon's surface approximately 55m east of the original target landing site,\" said Jaxa, adding that the onboard computer had also taken a decision in the final moments of descent to move the craft to one side to avoid obstacles.\nThis will delight officials, as will the success of the two rovers. Not only did Sora-Q move on the lunar surface and take its picture, but Lev-1 also managed to hop. Like Slim, Lev-1 has also powered down.\n\"The accomplishment of Lev-1's leaping movements on the lunar surface, inter-robot communication between Lev-1 and Sora-Q, and fully autonomous operations represent ground-breaking achievement. It would be regarded as a valuable technology demonstration for future lunar explorations, and the acquired knowledge and experience will be applied in upcoming missions,\" the agency said.",

    "Parcel delivery firm UPS has said it will cut 12,000 jobs, after it was hit by a softer economy and a labour fight that scared away some customers.\nChief executive Carol Tom\u00c3\u00a9 said 2023 was a \"difficult and disappointing year\", and the firm was investing in artificial intelligence (AI) as it pushes to become more efficient.\nShe has also called staff back to the office five days a week.\nThe job cuts are expected to reduce costs by $1bn (\u00c2\u00a3790m) this year.\nUPS, whose business is seen as an indicator of wider economic health, struggled last year with a fall in sales and profits, as the number of packages handled by the firm declined.\nThe company said that reflected economic weakness in Europe and parts of Asia, as well as disruption in the US, where a strike threatened by staff over the summer led some customers to shift their business to rivals.\nUPS said it had since won back about 60% of that business and expected modest growth to start to return this year, with average daily volumes flat or up 2% in the US and flat or up 3% internationally.\nBut its forecast was weaker than analysts had expected, sending shares down more than 7%.\nIt also warned that costs associated with its new contract with the Teamsters union would continue to weigh on the company over the next six months.\nAs part of that deal, the average full-time driver won a pay and benefits package worth about $170,000 (\u00c2\u00a3135,000) a year by the end of the five-year contract in 2028.\nThe 12,000 planned job cuts represent about 2.5% of the company's global workforce, which has already shrunk since the pandemic when a surge in online shopping prompted business to boom.\nExecutives said most of the positions would be cut from the ranks of its 85,000 management staff, as well as some contractors.

    "Promises of tax cuts during general election campaigns may have to be rolled back as the UK economy faces some of its worst problems since the 1950s, a leading think tank has said.\n\"Tax cuts today add to the risk of tax rises or spending cuts tomorrow,\" the Institute for Fiscal Studies said.\nPoliticians need to be honest about tough economic trade-offs, it added.\nBut the Treasury said the economy was turning a corner, and that growth would mean more funding for public services.\nIFS director Paul Johnson said that if political parties looking to form the next government \"are promising tax cuts, let's hear where the spending cuts will fall\".\n\"It might be easy to announce immediate tax cuts, without any hint of what it is the state currently does that it will stop doing, or what taxes will rise in future, but this trade-off cannot be wished away,\" the IFS's report said.\nThe government gets most of its income from taxes, but if it cannot cover its spending, it has to either borrow more, raise taxes, or cut public spending.\nLast month, government borrowing was lower than expected , and interest payments on debt dropped sharply due to a fall in the rate of inflation.\nAnalysts said this gave the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, more \"wiggle room\" to cut taxes.\nHowever, the IFS said that for the next government it would be more difficult to reduce the amount of debt the UK has compared with its economic output \"than in any other parliament since the 1950s\" - just after World War Two.\nNational debt is at levels last seen in the 1960s after the government spent billions supporting the economy during the Covid pandemic, and subsidised energy bills after a spike in energy prices caused in part by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nInterest payments on that debt, combined with sluggish growth, will make reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio more difficult.\nThere will be \"limited scope to cut taxes or increase spending by a meaningful amount\", because the two main UK-wide parties - the Conservatives and Labour - have pledged to get national debt as a share of national income falling, the IFS added.\nLast week, Mr Hunt hinted that he was aiming to cut taxes in the spring Budget.\nSpeaking at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland , he said that countries with lower taxes have more \"dynamic, faster growing economies\".\nIn the Autumn Statement in November last year, Mr Hunt announced a \u00c2\u00a310bn National Insurance cut for millions and an uplift in benefits, claiming the Conservatives have delivered the biggest tax cuts in decades in a move to boost the UK's stagnant economy and top up incomes.\nHowever, the UK's overall tax burden remains at a record high, largely due to frozen tax thresholds.\nThe IFS said with weak economic growth and a cost-of-living crisis, prospects for any winning government were \"miserable\".\nTo meet commitments on spending on the NHS, defence, childcare and international aid, the UK would need to find \u00c2\u00a320bn to avoid cuts to other services, the IFS said.\nBen Zaranko, a senior research economist at the IFS, told the BBC that long-term challenges to the economy such as an ageing population and tough climate commitments \"would start to bite\" this decade.\nBut the Treasury said its action to \"halve inflation and ensure debt falls as a share of the economy means we are now beginning to turn a corner, which is why we can afford tax cuts for 27 million working people this month\".\nA spokesperson said: \"The best way to deliver sustainable funding for public services in the future is to grow the economy - the UK has grown faster than France, Germany and Japan since 2010 and the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) say our action in spring and autumn will deliver the largest boost on record.\"\nLabour's spending plans include spending \u00c2\u00a328bn a year on green energy projects , reaching that figure after 2027.\nHowever, a Conservative Party spokesman said this \"unfunded spending promise will end up meaning thousands of pounds of higher taxes for working people.

We had a number of late resignations last term, which meant we are still currently recruiting for permanent teachers in some positions at Longsands.\"\nShe said it was \"unfortunate\" that unions were balloting for industrial action.\n\"We have done everything we can to engage with the unions to discuss their concerns and will continue to meet with them,\" she said.\n\"The wellbeing and happiness of staff are important and crucial in ensuring we provide an excellent education for the young people we serve at Longsands.\n\"We are working hard at Longsands to improve, which takes time, but we are doing everything we can to achieve a higher grading at the next Ofsted inspection.\"\nThe Department for Education spokesperson said: \"We are taking the long-term decisions to build up incentives, cut workload, and increase the routes into the teaching profession.\n\"This includes introducing financial incentives, forming a workload reduction taskforce and trying to embed a culture of flexible working in schools through flexible working ambassador schools.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Lord Sugar has said wannabe influencers are weeded out during the selection process for The Apprentice, as his team can \"smell them a mile off\".\nThe Apprentice returns to screens this week with 18 new candidates competing for a \u00c2\u00a3250,000 business investment.\nLord Sugar said his own staff sit in on casting calls and help avoid candidates who are only hungry for fame.\nBut he acknowledged the show needs \"a whole array of characters\" in order to be entertaining for viewers.\nLord Sugar told BBC culture correspondent Charlotte Gallagher it was a concern that some people apply for the show hoping only for a profile boost.\n\"That's why the production company that's been making this thing for 18 years, and my staff who go along to the auditions, can smell them a mile off,\" he said.\n\"And that's where they're eliminated in the first round.\"\n'A whole array of characters'\nBaroness Brady and Tim Campbell will once again assist Lord Sugar as he puts the new candidates through their paces in a series of business-related tasks.\n\"Let's be fair, the programme needs to be entertaining also, and you get the entertainment from a whole array of characters,\" Lord Sugar said.\n\"We can't just have stiff boring lawyers and accountants sitting in there... so some of the characters make the show interesting for the viewers.\n\"And there are some entertaining characters there,\" he added. \"I don't think they started out thinking they were going to become social media stars. The ones who apply who think that's what they're going to do, we eliminate them before they even get into the boardroom.\"\nThe businessman said candidates sometimes take some time to adapt to being on a television programme, and to understand the best way to get ahead.\n\"Television is new to them, the whole process is new to them, people pointing cameras at them and all that stuff,\" he said.\n\"And I guess a lot of them want to put themselves forward and be seen to be doing more, and that creates a situation where they kind of contradict each other, step on each other, and go against what's generally agreed.\"\nHe continued: \"They can't get into the fact that it's a team thing, not an individual thing, and it's not until we get later in the series that they start to realise they have to trust in the person who's been appointed the team leader and get on with it.\"\nThe Apprentice launched in 2005 in the UK and is about to broadcast its 18th series. Last year's winner was boxing gym owner Marnie Swindells.\nThe British version of the show remains a ratings hit for the BBC, despite the format no longer being as popular in other countries.\nEven with the careful casting process, Lord Sugar said it's impossible to tell who the likely winners are until a much later stage.\n\"You really can't tell from first impressions,\" he said. \"That's the beauty of the show, to allow the candidates a lot of opportunities to show themselves as time goes by.\"\nThe Apprentice returns at 21:00 GMT on Thursday 1 February on BBC One and then on iPlayer .",
    "A decorator who stole three watches worth more than \u00c2\u00a330,000 from the Duke of Westminster's home has been spared jail \"by the skin of his teeth\".\nMatthew Turner was given a 20-month sentence, suspended for two years, at Chester Crown Court after he admitted the burglary.\nTurner stole them from Hugh Grosvenor's bedroom while carrying out renovation work at Eaton Hall in August 2022.\nThe duke, one of the UK's richest men, is godfather to Prince George.\nThe court heard Turner, who was addicted to cocaine at the time, took a Cartier London Tank JC watch, bought for \u00c2\u00a318,000, a Panerai Luminor Marina watch, worth \u00c2\u00a37,000, and a Breitling watch, bought for the duke for his 21st birthday by his late father and his mother and worth about \u00c2\u00a37,000.\nThe burglary was only revealed when Harry Fane, who had sold the Cartier watch to the duke, spotted it for sale on an auction site in November that year in what was described in court as an \"astonishing coincidence\".\nThe other two watches have never been recovered.\nIn a victim impact statement the duke said: \"They are of huge sentimental value, beyond their financial worth.\"\nHe added: \"My bedroom is a private, extremely personal space within my home, I feel very uncomfortable knowing someone who is trusted to do a job has entered my room and stolen my personal possessions.\"\nSentencing, Honorary Recorder of Chester Judge Steven Everett told Turner: \"You have escaped prison by the skin of your teeth.\"\nHe said it was clear Turner, 24, had declined to tell police where the other two watches were.\nThe judge said: \"You made that decision not to, suggesting at least one of the watches went to your drug dealer.\"\nTurner was employed by a firm which had worked on the duke's estate on the outskirts of Chester, for more than 50 years and were \"well and truly trusted\" by the family, the court heard.\nThe 32-year-old duke took over his family's \u00c2\u00a31bn fortune and estate when his father Gerald died in 2016 .\nMyles Wilson, defending, said Turner had been spending hundreds of pounds on cocaine.\nHe said: \"It's a typical scenario where his debts increase, his dealers become more desperate, he becomes more desperate and he's committed crime and really self-destructed.\"\nPeter Hussey, prosecuting, said Turner had admitted a separate offence of theft after stealing \u00c2\u00a360 from a colleagues wallet while working at Top Gear Tyres in Ellesmere Port in December 2022.\nJudge Everett said although the financial backgrounds of both victims were \"entirely different\" the end result was the same.\nTurner was told he must complete 200 hours of unpaid work and 30 days of rehabilitation activity.\nThe judge said no order he could make could \"possibly compensate\" for the loss to the duke.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Putting on a European film premiere in Leicester Square was a \"different ball game\" for a small Hampshire-based PR firm, its owner has said.\nHundreds of fans turned out for the screening of the first episodes of The Chosen Season 4.\nThe streaming series has been viewed more than 600 million times worldwide.\nThe premiere cost about \u00c2\u00a31m and took more than six months to organise, with all the planning taking place at Kova International's office in Southampton.\nThe company, which employs nine people, landed the job when owner Judy May had a chance-meeting with someone connected to the show at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\"They were looking for a publicist in the UK and that's how it came about,\" she explained.\nIt is the largest project the PR firm has undertaken, with responsibility for every element from make-up artists to press junkets, flying in cast and crew, the VIP guest list, the after party and all the publicity on the night.\n\"We've done gala screenings before and flown over cast and crew but something like a Leicester Square takeover is a different ballgame,\" said Ms May, adding: \"But now it's a service we know we can offer.\"\nHer company was supported by sub-contractors and suppliers, most of whom are also based in the south of England.\nAmong them were Lizzie and Tom Redman, who travelled from Bournemouth to take the publicity photos for the premiere.\nMs Redman said it had been a step-up for their company, Redshoot Photography.\n\"We're used to shooting high-profile events with lots of pressure and this job feels like a progression,\" she explained, adding: \"It's brilliant to be asked and to be involved, it feels like a big deal for us.\"\nThe Chosen, which tells the story of Jesus Christ, was mainly filmed in the US but the UK film industry is booming.\nThe new Shinfield Studios are set to fully open later this year in Reading, Berkshire, with Disney already using the site for filming.\nBournemouth-based company Envista Branding made the merchandise for the premiere of The Chosen, and owner Adam Baxter said he hoped there would be a knock-on effect for creative companies.\n\"As the industry grows we want to grow with it,\" he told the BBC.\n\"We see merchandise as a great tool to promote TV and film, we're looking forward to seeing what this has in store for us.\"\nOn Monday night, the stars from the series walked a grey carpet and Irish-American actor Jonathan Roumie, who plays Jesus, said he was grateful for the work that went into the event.\nHe added: \"Just look at this, for people to come out in the cold weather just to be here because they are so devoted to the show, and supportive of what we do, it really warms the heart.\"\nThe screening was a success but the work for Kova was far from over, with a press junket taking place the following morning, but Ms May said she was looking forward to reflecting on a job well done.\n\"It's been so busy I haven't had a moment to think about it but tonight, hopefully, I'll feel a great sense of achievement,\" she said, adding: \"I want all my staff and suppliers to feel that.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "No serving leader in the European Union has led their country for as long as Viktor Orban.\nSince 2010, he has transformed Hungary into what the European Parliament has denounced as a \"hybrid regime of electoral autocracy\". He appears uncertain how to describe his own invention, trying both \"illiberal democracy\" and \"Christian liberty\".\nEither way, he has learned to maintain and constantly strengthen his grip on power.\nHe has repeatedly clashed with European Union colleagues on migration and the war in Ukraine, and has prevented \u00e2\u0082\u00ac50bn (\u00c2\u00a343bn; $55bn) of EU funds being handed to Kyiv to help Ukraine survive.\nHungary also finds itself the only Nato member country not to have approved Swedish membership, even though its prime minister claims to be in favour.\nAndras Kosa entitled his biography of Viktor Orban, Man of Chaos, suggesting he has a way of presenting himself as the only solution to a mess created by others.\nWhen toxic red sludge from a bauxite mine engulfed a Hungarian valley and threatened the Danube shore in 2010, he rolled up his sleeves and stacked sandbags alongside firemen and volunteers.\nAfter 14 years of uninterrupted rule, Viktor Orban's personal charisma is an unquestionable ingredient of his success, alongside an ability to \"think on the ball\", as his ex-football trainer once remarked.\nFormer political adviser George Birnbaum remembers \"a very intellectually smart individual\" with a \"well educated, intellectually deep knowledge of things, which is very rare,\" he told the BBC.\nViktor Orban first made his mark on Hungary in the late 1980s, as the Soviet Union began to fall apart, setting up a political movement called Fidesz, or Alliance of Young Democrats.\nHe was still a law student at Bibo College in the capital, Budapest, when in 1989 he delivered an audacious, seven-minute speech calling on the Soviet Red Army to go home.\n\"If we believe in our own power, we are able to finish the communist dictatorship,\" he declared to an estimated quarter of a million Hungarians gathered in the city's Heroes' Square for the reburial of the man behind Hungary's failed uprising in 1956, Imre Nagy.\nReflecting on his words 10 years later, he said he had \"exposed everyone's silent desire for free elections, and an independent and democratic Hungary\".\nBut the democracy that replaced authoritarian rule has changed dramatically in recent years, with widespread complaints of backsliding.\nVeteran Hungarian-born journalist Paul Lendvai sees a staggering reversal in Viktor Orban - \"from one of the most promising defenders of Hungarian democracy into the chief author of its demise\".\nProf Andras Bozoki, a former culture minister, describes Hungary since 2010 as being \"the only one former consolidated liberal democracy in the EU that has reached the level of a non-democratic system as a hybrid regime \".\nFor a Central European leader whose political infancy was rooted in the fall of Russia's hegemony, it seems odd he has become the closest ally in the EU of a Russian president who views the Soviet collapse as the \"greatest geopolitical catastrophe\" of the 20th Century, and one who began the biggest war on European soil since World War Two.\nViktor Orban was born in 1963 an hour to the west of Budapest, the eldest of three sons whose father was an agricultural engineer and Communist Party member and whose mother was a special needs teacher.\nThey had no running water at the family home in Felcsut, a village of fewer than 2,000 people where he still owns a house.\nIn an 1989 interview, he recalls being beaten twice a year by his father, Gyozo, whom he describes as a violent man: \"When he beat me, he also shouted. I remember all this as a bad experience.\"\nNothing about his childhood suggested that he would go on to challenge the communist regime. He attended a grammar school and was involved in the Young Communist League.\nHis main interest was football, playing for his local club, FC Felcsut, and he remains highly enthusiastic about his childhood sport. Ten years ago, he inaugurated a controversial new stadium there called the Pancho Arena, where top-flight team Puskas Akademia play to audiences of a few hundred.\nIn the months before he went to university, he carried out his military service, where he says he turned down an approach from the communist secret services to become an informer.\nHe was 23 when he married fellow student Aniko Levai, whom he met at university. They have five children, four daughters and a son, Gaspar, who was trained by the British Army at Sandhurst and serves as an officer in the Hungarian army in Chad.\nAfter his 1989 speech to a large crowd in Heroes' Square, he went on to study liberal political philosophy briefly at Oxford. His scholarship was funded by Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a benefactor he would turn against years later.\nWithin months he had abandoned his studies early to campaign in 1990 elections, when Fidesz won 22 seats, with Viktor Orban top of the party ",

    "Consultants have rejected the latest pay offer from the government in England - by the narrowest of margins.\nThe British Medical Association urged ministers to better the deal, after 51% voted against it, with a 65% turnout.\nThe deal offered was worth an extra 4.95%, on average, in basic pay from this month - and would have come on top of the 6% rise granted in April.\nHealth Secretary Victoria Atkins said she was disappointed the \"fair and reasonable\" offer had been rejected.\n\"The government is carefully considering the next steps,\" she added.\nConsultants staged four walkouts last year. They have a strike mandate until June but have yet to announce further action.\nThose at the much smaller Hospital Consultants and Specialists Union also rejected the deal.\nThe amount individual doctors would have received, on top of the 6% rise already granted, would have varied from 0% to nearly 13%, as part of an overhaul of their contracts.\nNurses and other health workers ended their strike action after receiving a 5% rise and a one-off payment of \u00c2\u00a31,655.\nAnd when the offer to consultants was made, last month, the Royal College of Nursing called it \"galling\" .\nBMA consultants leader Dr Vishal Sharma said: \"The vote has shown that consultants do not feel the current offer goes far enough to end the current dispute and offer a long-term solution.\n\"It backs up conversations we've had with colleagues in recent weeks, who felt the changes were insufficient and did not give them confidence that pay erosion would be addressed over the coming years.\n\"In addition, they were concerned about the fairness of the offer and how it impacted different groups of doctors.\n\"There were also clear concerns about changes to professional development time, and time dedicated to teaching and research.\n\"However, with the result so close, the consultants committee is giving the government a chance to improve the offer.\"\nThe contract changes linked to the offer included:\nThe BMA had also agreed to stop pushing for premium rates of up to \u00c2\u00a3269-an-hour for consultants to work overtime.\nBut the union's leadership then said the deal varied so much, depending on what stage of their career a doctor was at, it had been impossible to give a blanket recommendation.\nConsultants had originally asked for an above-inflation pay rise this year - a figure above 11% had been floated - and a commitment to start restoring pay in future years.\nSince 2008, pay levels had fallen significantly, once inflation was taken into account, the BMA had said.\nMeanwhile, the BMA has announced junior doctors will be balloted to extend their strike mandate, which ends in February.\nTalks with the government broke down in early December, prompting walkouts before Christmas and in the first week of January.\nAre you waiting a long time for treatment on the NHS?

    "A group of MPs has raised concerns that funding cuts and the relocation of a food check centre could raise the risk of diseases like African swine fever spreading in the UK.\nSpot checks on food imports are being moved from the port of Dover to Sevington, 22 miles (35km) inland.\nFunding cuts of 70% are also being made to food checks, which the group chair said could be \"catastrophic\".\nThe government said it was confident the checks mitigated biosecurity risks.\nA department for the environment, food and rural affairs (DEFRA) spokesperson said: \"We have strict border controls in place to protect food and animal health safety - and these, along with our high biosecurity standards, remain unchanged.\"\nIn recent weeks, port health officials have raised fears over disease spreading through illegal pork meat.\nThey are concerned African swine fever could enter the UK and said they were \"barely scratching the surface\" of banned meat entering at Dover.\nIn a letter to secretary of state, the environment, food and rural affairs committee chairman Sir Robert Goodwill said: \"The inland border facility at Sevington will require vehicles to travel 22 miles unsupervised across Kent, presenting potentially serious biosecurity risks, but also compromising compliance.\n\"We understand that drivers will be under no obligation to go to Sevington, if asked to do so.\n\"As such, we have real and reasonable concerns about the geographic dislocation of the inland border facility from the point of entry.\"\nSir Robert also raised the issue of funding cuts of 70% being proposed for the spot checks.\nHe said the Dover Port Health Authority had told him the cuts would have a \"catastrophic effect\" on UK biosecurity.\nExisting checks were introduced in September 2022, when it became illegal to bring pork and pork products weighing more than 2 kg (4.5 pounds) into the country, unless produced to the EU's commercial standards.\nOver 57 tonnes of illegal meat has been seized at the port since then.\nThe committee's letter has been sent on the day new post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports have come into force.\nDEFRA said: \"We are confident Sevington will have the necessary measures in place to appropriately mitigate biosecurity risks that relate to this facility being located away from the point of entry.\"\nSir Robert has asked Mr Barclay to respond to the committee's concerns by 16 February.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .
